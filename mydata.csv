National,1," By PATRICIA MAZZEIMARCH 15, 2018 Surveillance video released Thursday showed the only armed sheriff’s deputy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., remaining outside during the Feb. 14 massacre. FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Surveillance video released on Thursday showed that the only armed sheriff’s deputy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., remained outside during the Feb. 14 massacre at the school, taking cover behind a wall. The deputy failed to confront the gunman during the six-minute rampage, the video’s time stamps show, confirming the account of other law enforcement officers who raised questions about the response by the sheriff’s office almost immediately after the shooting. The 30-minute video shows former Deputy Scot Peterson flagging down another male staff member from the school at the main administration building and hopping on a golf cart to race toward the freshman building. Mr. Peterson takes cover outside the corner of an adjacent building, and the footage appears to show a few students rushing outside. More than 10 minutes later, other officers appear to reach Mr. Peterson’s position. The video has no sound.  While outside, Mr. Peterson provided frequent updates on police radio, according to a timeline provided by the sheriff’s office, including directing other officers to the building on the large campus and asking for nearby streets to be shut down.  Inside the building, wounded victims lay bleeding in hallways and classrooms, according to 911 calls from students and teachers that were released on Wednesday by the Coral Springs Police Department. Those calls were the second batch of recordings made public from the shooting. “They’re all bleeding,” a sobbing girl whispered to an emergency operator. “They’re going to die.” News organizations including The New York Times had petitioned for the release of the surveillance video footage, and Judge Jeffrey R. Levenson of Broward County Circuit Court ordered that it be made public by noon Thursday. Sheriff Scott Israel said that the video showed the deputy doing “nothing” as the gunman killed 14 students and three educators, and wounded 17 more people. One wounded student remains in the hospital. “He never went in,” the sheriff  said of Mr. Peterson in a news conference on Feb. 22. “There are no words,” said Sheriff Israel, who described himself as “devastated, sick to my stomach” after watching the video. Office policy requires deputies to try to confront a gunman as quickly as possible, without waiting for backup. Sheriff Israel later defended his “amazing leadership,” despite Mr. Peterson’s inaction and other questionable decisions by his command staff, which set up a perimeter around the school before it was clear that the shooting was over, instead of moving in on the gunman. Mr. Peterson was suspended and then resigned his post. In a statement released by his lawyer, he said that he thought the gunfire originated from outside the building, and reacted accordingly by waiting for the suspect there. But a detailed timeline based on radio dispatches and surveillance footage, released last week by the sheriff’s office, suggested that he came to believe the shots might be coming from inside.      In one of his first communications, he said, “Be advised we have possible, could be firecrackers, I think we have shots fired, possible shots fired by the 1200 building.” Later, he said, “We also heard it’s by— inside the 1200 building.”  Mr. Peterson also told other law enforcement officers who raced to the school to stay outside. Coral Springs officers, the first to arrive on the scene, pushed into the building anyway. By then, the gunman had already fled. Mr. Peterson’s lawyer, Joseph A. DiRuzzo III, did not respond on Thursday to requests for comment on the video. Nikolas Cruz, 19, a former Stoneman Douglas High student, was later arrested about two miles from the school. He has been charged with 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder in the shooting. The law enforcement response to the shooting was also hampered by the failure of Broward County’s police radio system. The sheriff’s office was unable to connect its radio transmissions with those of the Coral Springs police, who operate on a separate system. Coral Springs police radio recordings released on Wednesday suggest that Mr. Peterson failed to give clear information to the first arriving officers about where the shooting had taken place. Officer Tim Burton is heard to say that he had his rifle and was standing outside the building with Mr. Peterson, “getting info.” But what was relayed on the radio was that the gunman might have been spotted outside in a parking lot. “We don’t know where he’s at,” an exasperated officer said on radio. The radio dispatches show that the police knew quickly that they were looking for a white male wearing a burgundy Junior R.O.T.C. shirt. Officers described coming across bodies, bleeding students and bullet-pocked windows. Coral Springs officers tried to find the gunman using the video surveillance system at the school. But they later realized they were watching the video on a 20-minute delay, according to the department. The delay had led them to believe mistakenly that the shooting was still happening. Why they were not watching live video images, when that feature was available, remains unclear. Eventually, officers spotted Mr. Cruz on the recorded video, running out of the west side of the freshman building with other students. A Coconut Creek police officer saw him about an hour after the shooting, walking down a residential street. “I have the suspect, Nikolas Cruz,” Officer Michael Leonard said on radio. Then he yelled to Mr. Cruz, “Stand by right there. Do not move!” Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.

National,2," Supported by By Audra D. S. Burch and Patricia Mazzei PARKLAND, Fla. — For the latest on the Florida school shooting, read our Thursday live updates. PARKLAND, Fla. — One student hit her record button while being led out of the school to safety by sheriff’s deputies. On her way, her cellphone’s shaking camera lens passed over several bodies sprawled on the floor. In another cellphone video, several dozen gunshots were audible not far away. “Oh my God! Oh my God!” one student shouted. Like many school districts, Broward County’s allows high school students to bring cellphones to school, so long as they don’t interfere with class work. On Wednesday, many students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School held onto their phones for dear life as a 19-year-old gunman, Nikolas Cruz, stalked the grounds and fatally shot 17 people. They used them to keep their terrified parents informed about what was happening. And they used them to keep a visual record of an awful crime. Sarah Crescitelli, a freshman, was in drama class rehearsing for a coming run of the musical “Yo, Vikings,” when gunshots rang out. Hiding in a sweltering storage room with about 40 other students, she typed out a text message to her mother, Stacy, for what she thought might be the last time. A gunman armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifle and “countless magazines” killed at least 17 people at his former high school on Wednesday. “If I don’t make it,” she wrote, “I love you and I appreciate everything you did for me.” Some of the alarming videos of the mass shooting were passed around via text message, while others quickly made their way to Twitter, where they triggered “sensitive material” warnings. One video showed officers with guns drawn, rushing into a classroom full of cowering students. The officers told students to put up their hands. One officer bellowed: “Put your phones away! Put your phones away!” Parkland is the type of community where affluent young parents move to find verdant parks and pristine sidewalks for their children. Most everybody knows somebody at Stoneman Douglas High, home of the Eagles. A famous alumnus of M.S.D., as the school is widely known, is Anthony Rizzo, who plays first base for the Chicago Cubs. Sheriff Scott Israel, who was briefing journalists on the tragedy inside the school, has triplets who graduated from M.S.D. and played football and lacrosse and ran track there. Sheriff Israel said one of his deputies had learned that his son had been injured in the attack. State Representative Jared Moskowitz, who graduated from M.S.D. in 1999, sends his 4-year-old to a preschool down the street. The high school, with more than 3,000 students, is almost a city within a city, with airy breezeways and an open courtyard. It bears the name of Stoneman Douglas, the famed environmentalist who crusaded against paving over the Everglades. Since 26 people were killed in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, a nonprofit that tracks school shootings has recorded five a month, on average. “It’s surreal,” Mr. Moskowitz said. “People don’t come to Parkland to open a business. They come to Parkland to raise a family. They come to Parkland to send their child to an A-rated school. They come to Parkland to live in the safest community in the county.” Every morning at Stoneman Douglas High begins with an affirmation, which is read over the intercom. On Wednesday morning, the affirmation began with the word life. “Life supports me in every way possible” were the first words students heard that day. The announcement went on to speak of Valentine’s Day, and how everyone “deserves a safe and healthy relationship.” The Astronomy Club announced that it was celebrating Black History Month on Thursday night with a showing of the movie “Hidden Figures.” But that event was postponed, as Stoneman Douglas canceled all school events and called in grief counselors. Melissa Falkowski was teaching a journalism class when the fire alarm went off at about 2:30 p.m. It had been activated shortly before the shots began, perhaps an effort by the gunman to sow confusion. And it was the second time the alarm went off Wednesday, after a fire alarm earlier in the day. “Everyone is annoyed because we’d already had one today,” she said. “It’s unusual but it’s not unheard-of, because sometimes someone in culinary burns something and it might go off three times in a day.” There also had been a drill a few weeks before: an active-shooter drill, the kind many schools now do. Dutifully, Ms. Falkowski followed the fire drill protocol and filed her students out of the classroom to their appointed gathering spot. One of the school’s security officers told her: “No, it’s a code red. Go back.” In geometry class, Gabriella Figueroa, 16, a junior, had been working on angle bisectors when the alarm sounded. As she neared the exit doors, she heard the first gunshots and ran back to class. “I was shaking and praying and saying, ‘God, please get me out of here,’” she said. Ms. Falkowski took 20 students into a closet reserved for photo gear. Some of the students began to sob, but most stayed quiet, texting in the dark. It got so hot that they had to crack the door open periodically to get enough air. Finally, after 35 minutes, they heard noises inside the classroom, and then a voice: “This is the police. Is anyone in here?” The shooting had happened in a different building. None of them had heard gunfire. Most of the 17 children and adults who died remained unidentified by the authorities as of Wednesday night. One of the complications, the sheriff said, was that the students’ identifications were still in their backpacks, which they had left behind in the havoc. Reporting was contributed by Neil Reisner from Parkland, Fla., and Anemona Hartocollis and Timothy Williams from New York.       Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS",2018-02-15,0.87542045,Thursday
Culture,3," By ALEXIS SOLOSKIAPRIL 18, 2018 BOCA RATON, Fla. — On a Tuesday evening in a small theater in the back of a shopping center here, the teenage cast of the rock musical “Spring Awakening” pogoed around the stage, shouting the unprintable lyrics from one of its most ferocious songs. Ever since the show opened on Broadway in 2006, collecting eight Tony Awards, it has attracted a fervid teenage following, and is steadily performed in high schools and colleges. But most young casts haven’t survived a catastrophe that dovetails eerily with the show’s plot. They haven’t  galvanized a movement that has made each rehearsal a potential target. And they haven’t had the chance to take a break from all that by singing the score with most of the show’s original Broadway cast belting and bouncing right beside them. Lea Michele, who went on to star on “Glee,” arrived at the Boca Black Box theater with a face red from sunburn. It turned redder with emotion. Jonathan Groff, previously on Broadway in “Hamilton,” now on Netflix’s “Mindhunter,” headbanged beneath a Mets cap.  The professional performers were in the audience at the theater, which is 10 miles away from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the site of the Feb. 14 school shooting that left 17 dead. A third of the cast members in this local “Spring Awakening,” a production of Barclay Performing Arts, a training and theater company, are students at the school.  They began rehearsals five weeks before the shooting and they insisted on continuing after. The show opens May 2. As Broadway musicals go, “Spring Awakening,” with music by Duncan Sheik and book and lyrics by Steven Sater, is arguably the worst show that a town in South Florida could stage right now. Or if you believe in catharsis, in theater’s ability to transmute painful feelings into something constructive and cleansing, maybe it’s the best. Based on Frank Wedekind’s 1891 play, it’s a story of adolescents failed by an older generation, with tragic results. The character of Melchior, which vaulted Mr. Groff to stardom and is played here by the 17-year-old Never Again activist Cameron Kasky, sings a second-act number flanked by the ghosts of a dead friend and a dead lover. But for many of the students, rehearsal has been a reprieve, a temporary escape from real-life dramas. As Sawyer Garrity, 16, who plays Melchior’s lover Wendla (Ms. Michele’s role), said before rehearsal began: “Nothing has been normal. This isn’t even fully normal.” (Because of death threats some of the students have received, a police cruiser waits in the parking lot during every rehearsal.) “But this is the one place where I’m centered,” she said. When the Broadway actor Gideon Glick read about the production in a New Yorker article, he reached out to its director, Christine Barclay, asking if a visit would be welcome. With her approval, he began to muster his former castmates. Many of the actors had flown in that day. Several of them were bunking together at a house Remy Zaken had borrowed. Lilli Cooper couldn’t make it. She’s starring in “SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical.” But she FaceTimed the girl playing Martha, her “Spring Awakening” role.  Theater-world support has become a part of this new not-normal. Every current Broadway show has provided the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Drama Club with signed posters or similar swag. The evening before this rehearsal some of the “Spring Awakening” student actors had performed alongside “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” cast members in a benefit concert called “From Broadway With Love.” But even generosity can breed exhaustion and complicate grieving. After the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, there were so many fund-raisers and celebrity stop-ins that Newtown’s first selectman requested an end to outside events in town. With that in mind, Mr. Glick hadn’t publicized the visit and he and Ms. Barclay had conceived it as a respite with occasional music, a chance for the young actors to chat “Hair” with Mr. Groff and “Glee” with Ms. Michele, to “feel good and supported,” he said, speaking by telephone the week before. Ms. Barclay wanted that, too. But she also hoped that the professional actors could counsel the students on taking a character to a dark place without staying there yourself, on making it “not so personal and raw,” she said a few days before the Broadway actors arrived. In the theater, after the breathless warm-up, the rehearsal began in earnest, with the original cast watching from three and four rows back. “They’re here to support your rehearsal. They’re not here to cast you in the next Broadway show,” Ms. Barclay said. “I wish someone would cast me in the next Broadway show,” Skylar Astin, who played Georg onstage, murmured jokingly.      Performing in front of the invited guests wasn’t always easy. Alfonso Calderon, 17, had to mime masturbation right in front of what he called “his celebrity crushes and dreams.” He looked ashen when he finished the scene, though he still managed to compliment Mr. Astin on the “Pitch Perfect” movies. The Broadway actors praised the vulnerability and even the discomfort of some of the student actors. “I can see in your faces and on your bodies what we felt as well when we were first doing the show,” Phoebe Strole said during a break. “It’s like taking your heart out of your chest and shoving it at us.” “But you also have to be loud, guys,” Mr. Glick said, adding an apologetic, “I don’t want to be like a Jewish mother here.” “Please Jewish mother them,” Ms. Barclay said. (A new mother herself, she’d brought her 2-month-old baby to the rehearsal.)  Eventually a prop gun required by the script would be used, but Ms. Barclay hadn’t introduced it yet. No one wanted to mention the shooting head-on, though there were some oblique references to Valentine’s Day. When a question for the Broadway actors seemed to veer that way, Mr. Kasky, who had spent most of the rehearsal threatening to break into “Under the Sea” from “The Little Mermaid,” tensed up. “We want to talk less about the shooting,” he said. His character cried during a funeral scene in a way that seemed to bypass technique. The professional actors had advice on handling the hard stuff. “You choose when you want to use what you went through to cry or to laugh or do whatever, and if you don’t, if you just want to go into the song, you can do that, too,” Ms. Michele said. The younger actors studied their counterparts as though searching for clues about what their own lives would be 12 years from now. But mostly they wanted to be near the people who had sung the same songs and mumbled the same speeches and known what it is to show up for rehearsal with a face full of pimples or perform a love scene when your own body is still a mystery. “I felt like, ‘Am I going to have to pretend I have any clue what I’m doing?’” Mr. Groff confessed. The Broadway actors, meanwhile, were confronted with visions of their teenage selves, and clutched each other while the students sang. At times they sang along quietly, unable to help themselves, lifting the cast up with the harmonies they still remembered. “It was really cool,” Ethan Kaufman, a 15-year-old Stoneman Douglas student, said. “I am awe-struck.” The feeling was mutual. An hour after rehearsal ended, the 2006 Ilse huddled with the 2018 one. A group of boys circled Mr. Astin as he took them through the Latin chants that the characters in the show recite. The Broadway actors didn’t want the evening or this happy-sad reunion to end.  “Tonight we do the show starting from the top at Remy’s house,” Ms. Michele said.

National,4," By JACK HEALY and PATRICIA MAZZEIFEB. 25, 2018 PARKLAND, Fla. — It was time to go back. Back into the high school where they had seen their teachers and classmates gunned down. Where friends from marching band or English class had been killed. Where they had cowered in closets, counted gunshots and wondered if they were going to die. Thousands of students and parents poured into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Sunday afternoon, for the first time since the mass shooting at the school on Feb. 14. They walked past police cruisers and memorial flowers to gather the backpacks and books they had left behind as they fled, and to take their first steps toward resuming classes on a campus now indelibly linked to America’s wrenching cultural battle over gun laws and how to stop mass shootings. That debate largely stayed outside on Sunday. Inside Stoneman Douglas High, students said, they mostly just hugged. They hugged friends they hadn’t seen since the shooting, and they hugged friends who had been with them every day. They hugged their teachers, and friends’ parents, and classmates they barely knew, while their parents hugged other parents. They wore T-shirts that said “Douglas Strong” and “Parkland United,” and displayed hair they had dyed to honor Joaquin or a new tattoo to remember Gina. As students and teachers reunited inside Stoneman Douglas, Briana Valli, 17, said that one refrain from the past week — Are you doing O.K.? — was giving way to another: We’re glad you’re here.  “It actually felt good to be in the building,” she said. “We’re all going through this together.”  The gathering on Sunday was the beginning of what Broward County school officials have called a “phased reopening” of the school where 17 students and staff members were killed. Teachers and the rest of the staff will return to work on Monday and Tuesday; the students will come back for classes starting on Wednesday. Initially, the school day will last only until 11:40 a.m., and many students said they expected to do little else on those first few days besides discuss the shooting; gun control; mental health issues; and the long, complicated path toward healing that lies ahead for them, their families and their town. How do you pick up with English projects and science lessons, students wondered, when the study partners who helped you make Romeo and Juliet masks and write an essay on climate change are dead? The protests calling for stricter gun control measures come on the heels of other youth movements, but the momentum they have gained makes them stand out. “They’re just not there,” said Lourdes Konwufine, 15. Leah Ronkin, 16, said she went to the drama room where she had hidden in a closet during the massacre. She retrieved her backpack, her lunchbox and a white teddy bear her boyfriend had given her for Valentine’s Day. “It’s like the first day of school,” she said, “but it’s not normal at all.” Some students said that they dreaded returning, and that wandering around Stoneman Douglas again on Sunday felt surreal. Their school was now a place filled with grief counselors, comfort dogs, and posters of sympathy and solidarity from high schools across the country. The three-story freshman building, where most of the bloodshed occurred, remained fenced off and closed, and it will not reopen for classes. School officials, parents and students have called for it to be demolished, with a memorial built in its place. Some students said they felt happy to be back, and were buoyed by the support of their friends. Others said the echoes of that day were inescapable.  “It makes you feel kind of empty inside,” said Ryan Senatore, 15. “Walking back in where 17 lives passed — it’s a disgusting feeling. It’s never going to be the same. Never.” Ryan LoFurno, 16, went into a physics classroom to get his backpack and car keys. His parents walked in with him, and said they were struck to be standing where their son had hidden in a corner as gunfire exploded in the next building. “This is where he was,” said Ryan’s mother, Denise. “He was closer than I thought.” “A lot closer,” said his father, Anthony.      Several parents said on Sunday that they were not worried about sending their children back to Stoneman Douglas, which is now ringed by official vehicles. But as they walked into the school, some said they were growing angrier over reports that have raised questions about the Broward County Sheriff’s Office, including how its officers responded to the shooting and how earlier warnings about the suspected gunman were handled. Sheriff Scott Israel defended his actions as “amazing leadership” on Sunday during a tense interview broadcast on CNN. The sheriff, a Democrat who won re-election to the post easily in 2016, said he would not resign, despite growing criticism of his deputies’ actions. The speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and dozens of other Republican lawmakers on Sunday called on Gov. Rick Scott, also a Republican, to use his authority to suspend the sheriff from office. The governor’s office announced that state officials would conduct an investigation of the law enforcement response to the shooting. Sheriff Israel’s office said it welcomed the governor’s move and would cooperate with the investigation. Sheriff Israel said he should not be held responsible for the armed deputy assigned to the school, who failed to enter the building to confront the gunman while the massacre was in progress. That deputy has resigned, and the sheriff said he would investigate whether others arriving on the scene also held back. “Deputies make mistakes,” the sheriff said on the CNN program, “State of the Union.” “Police officers make mistakes. But it’s not the responsibility of a general or the president if you have a deserter.” Sheriff Israel added, “You don’t measure a person’s leadership by a deputy not going in.”  In Parkland, several students said they had to steel themselves to re-enter the school on Sunday. They spoke of feeling panicky and queasy, and of asking parents and older siblings to accompany them. Tyjanai Thomas, 15, said that she had seen her freshman geography teacher gunned down, and that she was focusing on staying calm. On the sidewalk outside, she held tight to a pearl pendant that hung on a silver chain around her neck — a gift from her godmother, she said. She wondered whether she could handle three more years in this place. Sunday would be the first test. “At some point, we’ve got to face reality,” she said. And then she walked back into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Jack Healy reported from Parkland, Fla., and Patricia Mazzei from Miami.

National,5," By JULIE TURKEWITZ, PATRICIA MAZZEI and AUDRA D. S. BURCHFEB. 16, 2018 Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., hid in closets as a gunman fired a semiautomatic weapon into their classrooms. Seventeen people were killed. PARKLAND, Fla. — Grief and raw anger were palpable on Friday at the first funerals for students who died in one of the deadliest shootings in modern American history earlier this week. “You,” said Andrew Pollack, directing his fury at the man who authorities have identified as the gunman who killed his daughter, Meadow Pollack, 18. “Killed. My. Kid. My kid is dead. It goes through my head all day. And night.” As the burials began for the 17 victims, the F.B.I. acknowledged that it had failed to act on a warning last month that Nikolas Cruz, the suspect in Wednesday’s shooting, might kill people at a school. On Friday evening, President Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, made an unannounced visit to meet with law enforcement officials and medical workers who helped in the wake of the shooting. The consequences from the shooting have reverberated far beyond school, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., as schools around the nation closed Friday, or canceled activities after receiving threats. A teacher in Denver said she moved items from a closet in her classroom “to make more space for 9-year-olds to hide.”  Here’s the latest: • Mr. Cruz is being held without bond at the Broward County jail, where he has been placed on suicide watch, according to Gordon Weekes, the county’s chief assistant public defender. He faces 17 counts of premeditated murder.  • A federal law enforcement official on Friday said that Mr. Cruz fired more than 100 rounds during the shooting. • Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward County said that his office had received about 20 calls about Mr. Cruz over the past two years, though cautioned that some of the calls may not have resulted in a response by officers. • More than 2,000 students have been interviewed as part of the investigation, the sheriff said. He added that Mr. Cruz did not have a gas mask or smoke grenades, as had previously been reported. • In Florida, an AR-15 is easier to buy than a handgun. Read more on how the AR-15 became one of the weapons of choice for mass killers, and the research that tries to explain the high rate of mass shootings in the United States. • Sign up for the Morning Briefing for news and a daily look at what you need to know to begin your day. The F.B.I.’s admission that it failed to act on a tip in January from a person close to Mr. Cruz prompted Gov. Rick Scott of Florida to call for the bureau’s director to resign. At a candlelight vigil Thursday night for the 17 people killed in a Florida school shooting, attendees chanted, “No more guns.” The bureau, which was already under considerable political pressure because of its investigation into Mr. Trump, faced calls for even more scrutiny following the massacre.  Mr. Scott said that Christopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., should step down and that the bureau’s failure to act on the tip about Mr. Cruz was “unacceptable.” “Seventeen innocent people are dead and acknowledging a mistake isn’t going to cut it,” Mr. Scott said in a statement. In an unusually sharp public rebuke of his own agents, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Friday that the missed warnings had “tragic consequences” and that “the F.B.I. in conjunction with our state and local partners must act flawlessly to prevent all attacks. This is imperative, and we must do better.” Robert F. Lasky, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I. field office in Miami, said the agency advised the victims’ parents about the misstep in a conference call on Friday. “We will be looking into where and how the protocol broke down,” he said. Read more here. At the first funeral, Alyssa Miriam Alhadeff, 14, was remembered for her joy and kindness, traits that had attracted a wide circle of friends. Hundreds of mourners filled the Star of David Funeral Chapel in North Lauderdale, Fla., spilling outside. Among the youngest victims, Alyssa, an honor student and a player for the Parkland soccer club, was buried in the Garden of Aaron at Star of David Memorial Gardens. Her mother, Lori Alhadeff, urged Alyssa’s friends to stay in touch, but also let their future success be her daughter’s legacy. “Live, breathe for Alyssa,” she said. At a synagogue just a mile from where she had been gunned down, Meadow Pollack, 18, lay in a plain wooden coffin, closed in accordance with Jewish tradition. Before her were hundreds of mourners, seated in row upon row and crowding every wall and corner: her cousins, her classmates, the governor and so many others. She is survived by many family members, including her brothers and her grandmother Evelyn. Her father stood in a black suit before the crowd. “How does this happen to my beautiful, smart, loving daughter?” Mr. Pollack said. “She is everything. If we could learn one thing from this tragedy, it’s that our everythings are not safe when we send them to school.”  The room heaved with sobbing teenagers, and mourners wheeled out Ms. Pollack’s coffin, to be buried in a nearby cemetery. The Trumps arrived Friday evening at a hospital in Pompano Beach that took in eight of the shooting victims, accompanied by John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. The president and Mrs. Trump visited the Broward Health North Hospital “to pay their respects and thank the medical professionals for their life-saving assistance,” according to a statement related by a White House spokeswoman on Friday evening. When asked if he met with victims, Mr. Trump said: “Yes, I did. I did indeed.” “It’s sad something like that could happen,” he said. Mr. Trump did not respond when he was asked if gun laws needed to be changed. He then walked into another room. Later, speaking during a meeting with law enforcement officials at the Broward County sheriff’s office, the president thanked first responders for what he called an “incredible job,” according to a White House press pool report. Mr. Trump said he had met with the parents of some of the victims, and also spoke with a female victim at the hospital who he said had been shot four times and was saved because emergency workers got her to the hospital quickly.  The authorities were still investigating reports of shots fired on Friday morning at Highline College, about half an hour’s drive south of Seattle, said Capt. Kyle Ohashi, a spokesman for the Puget Sound Regional Fire Authority. No physical evidence of a weapons discharge — including shell casings or damage to any structure — had been found, he said. The school said in a statement on Facebook that the situation was cleared about three hours after a lockdown began. Several other agencies, including the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, had also responded. The Gilchrist County School District in Florida shuttered its schools after receiving an email threat, and the Nutley Public School System in New Jersey also said it would be closed because of a security threat. A high school in Colorado Springs canceled a pep rally. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     Schools also wrestled with how to proceed with lockdown drills, which have become as routine as fire drills as students prepare for the possibility of a shooting. Some schools opt to make the drills feel partially authentic — an approach several schools backed off from this week out of fear they would stir already heightened anxieties. At Dysart High School in El Mirage, Ariz., the principal took extra steps to make sure students knew its previously scheduled drill on Thursday was, in fact, just a drill. The reminder was included in the morning announcements, and she reiterated it on the public address system several times throughout the day, said Zachery Fountain, a district spokesman. Eureka High School in Eureka, Calif., postponed its drill that had been scheduled for Thursday, partly because officials were concerned about the mental state of students, said Fred Van Vleck, the district superintendent. Typically, the school doesn’t announce that the lockdown is a drill, telling students only that there could be a drill within a one-week window, he said. Read more about the school closings. During the horror at Stoneman Douglas High on Wednesday, Carly Novell, a 17-year-old senior who is an editor for the school’s quarterly magazine, hid in a closet and thought about an awful family tragedy from before she was born. Her mother had told her about how her grandfather had survived a mass shooting in 1949 in Camden, N.J. His family had not made it. “My grandfather was 12, and his grandma and his mom and dad were killed while he hid in a closet,” Ms. Novell said. “They heard gunshots on the street, so my great-grandma told my grandpa to hide in the closet, so he was safe. But he didn’t have a family after that.” Interviewed on Thursday, she said: “I was thinking of him while I was in the closet. I was wondering what he felt like while he was there. My mom has told me he was in shock after it, too — that he didn’t remember how he got to the police station, or anything like that. I didn’t forget anything, but I was in shock and I didn’t understand what was going on.” 
                A gunman armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifle and “countless magazines” killed at least 17 people at his former high school on Wednesday.             In an orange jumpsuit and shackled around his hands, feet and waist, Mr. Cruz was asked if he understood the circumstances of his appearance in court. “Yes, ma’am,” he whispered. Nikolas Cruz, shown with a public defender, was ordered to be held in jail without bond. “He’s sad. He’s mournful,” his public defender, Melisa McNeill, said afterward. “He is fully aware of what is going on, and he’s just a broken human being.”  Mr. Weekes, the chief assistant public defender, said lawyers were still trying to piece together the details of Mr. Cruz’s life. He has a “significant” history of mental illness, according to Mr. Weekes, and may be autistic or have a learning disability. But Mr. Weekes was not ready to say whether he would pursue a mental health defense. Howard Finkelstein, the chief public defender in Broward County, said the case would present a difficult question: Should society execute mentally ill people? “There’s no question of whether he will be convicted of capital murder 17 times,” he said. “When we let one of our children fall off grid, when they are screaming for help in every way, do we have the right to kill them when we could have stopped it?” Elected and law enforcement officials — from Mr. Trump to the Broward County sheriff — have ramped up their demands for expanded authority over the mentally ill who pose a danger. In doing so, they stepped into a long and complicated balancing act in the United States between public safety and the right to bear arms for people with mental health issues. Others, including some gun control and mental health advocates, point to the increasing number of states that allow law enforcement officers or, in some cases, family members or others to petition a court to temporarily take guns from people who pose a danger to themselves or others. The measures, known as “red flag laws” or extreme risk protection orders, have shown evidence of reducing suicides in Connecticut, where the first such law was passed in 1999, and in recent years have also been passed in California, Washington and Oregon. Eighteen states, including Florida, and the District of Columbia are considering such laws this year, according to a list compiled by Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group. Red flag laws “provide a path to remove guns from somebody in a temporary crisis,” said Avery Gardiner, the co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. And, she said, even if a family decides not to seek a gun restraining order, the fact that the option exists can prompt frank conversations with struggling relatives.

National,6," By RICHARD FAUSSET, SERGE F. KOVALESKI and PATRICIA MAZZEIFEB. 16, 2018 PARKLAND, Fla. — Daniel Medeiros was in a fourth-period English class, feeling worn down by a lesson on sonnets when the fire alarm went off. “Oh yeah,” he thought to himself. “Sweet.” Moments earlier, Haeseung Lee had left his psychology class to go to the bathroom when he heard a succession of bangs. What he knows about firearms he learned from video games. But these sounded a lot like gunshots. He bolted for a classroom. It was the beginning of six minutes of gunfire that would obliterate what was supposed to be a day like any other at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. A troubled ex-student, Nikolas Cruz, had ridden to campus in an Uber with a legally purchased AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and a backpack full of ammunition. His lightning attack, between 2:21 p.m. and 2:27 p.m., would leave 17 people dead. Second by second, lives at Stoneman Douglas were transformed, broken and stolen. Students locked themselves in closets. They considered fighting back, and considered their own deaths. And amid gunfire and chaos, they shot urgent text messages to their parents.  Jackie McKenna, 17, a senior, texted her mother, Tina McKenna, at 2:30 p.m. “Mom we are in a code black,” she wrote. “There are gun shots.”  “Are you aware of the situation right now,” Daniel texted his mother, who speaks Portuguese. “What happened,” she texted back. “Alguma coisa na escola?” Something at school? And then: “Are you O.K.?” It was Valentine’s Day. The morning and early afternoon had unfolded in a whirl of big balloons, stuffed animals and multicolored carnations from a $1 flower sale. The gay/straight student alliance encouraged students to sign “declarations of love.” Daniel, 17, a star on the varsity soccer team, had given his girlfriend chocolates in the parking lot before school. Just after 2 p.m., Mr. Cruz, 19, took a compact gold Uber car to campus. Mr. Cruz was texting from inside the car with a student at Stoneman Douglas, the son of a family that had taken him in after his mother died in November. Earlier that day, Mr. Cruz had texted: “I have to tell you something important soon,” according to a person close to the family. But when his friend asked what, Mr. Cruz did not explain. “Nothing man,” he wrote from inside the Uber, heading to the school where his friend was in class. His final text came at 2:18 p.m., a minute before the car dropped him off. “Yo,” he wrote. Then he entered the three-story Freshman Building, carrying an AR-15 in a soft black rifle case. Chris McKenna, a 15-year-old freshman, was trying to get to the bathroom in the building when he encountered Mr. Cruz in the stairwell. Mr. Cruz was loading bullets into his rifle. “He told me, ‘Better get out of here, things are about to get messy,’” Chris recalled. “I had no idea who he was.”  At 2:21 p.m., Mr. Cruz began shooting into four classrooms. Moises Lobaton, a senior, was in psychology class when the gunfire boomed. The students scurried to get as far away from the door as possible. Moises, who turned 18 on Friday, counted eight shots before the bullets shattered the glass window on the door, injuring at least three of his classmates, including a girl who “wasn’t moving at all.” “She was next to a pool of blood, but I couldn’t tell if it was hers or the guy next to hers,” Moises said. The boy had been shot in the arm and was bleeding profusely. His classmates wrapped the arm in cloth. Moises squeezed the hand of his sister’s best friend, who was bleeding from a bullet that grazed her knee. Another boy called 911. “I was too scared to look up, so I kept my head down, looking at the floor,” Moises said. “The shots were something I’ll never forget. It sounded like bombs going off, one at a time. If I was one or two feet to the right, I would have died.” After his run-in with Mr. Cruz in the stairwell, Chris went out the closest door and told Aaron Feis, a football coach and security guard, what he had seen. Mr. Feis took Chris on his golf cart to a baseball field, about 500 feet away from the Freshman Building. “He said, ‘Stay here,’” Chris recalled. “So I stood there for a little bit, and then I heard shots go off, and from there I ran fast as I could to Walmart.” Other students later said Mr. Feis had died shielding people from gunfire. Inside the building, Mr. Cruz had moved to the second floor and shot someone in a classroom. Calls began streaming into 911. A description of the shooter went out over police radio: maroon shirt, black pants and a black hat, and carrying a black duffel bag and a black backpack. It was 2:24 p.m. Mr. Cruz climbed the stairs to the third floor, where Scott Beigel, 35, taught freshman geography. He had broken the class into small groups for a quiz game on Asian geography.  Mr. Beigel had initially accompanied his class down to the second floor when the alarm went off. But as shots echoed through the hallways, he shepherded them back upstairs to take cover in the classroom. One of the last students to slip inside the classroom was Matthew Zeif, 14, just ahead of Mr. Beigel. Seconds later, the room filled with smoky haze, Matthew remembered. He turned to see his teacher lying by the door, pale and bleeding. He had been shot before he could lock the door. As students pressed themselves against the wall, they worried that the gunman would enter the room. Haeseung, who had rushed into a classroom full of incredulous students, eventually heard an administrator on the intercom speaking in a serious tone he had never heard before: “He said, ‘evacuate the building right now.’ So I ran again.” He rushed outside to the bus loop, but teachers yelled at him to go back inside. He ended up in a counseling office with 50 other students, behind locked metal doors. Everyone was texting and calling friends and family. Haeseung sent numerous texts to his friend Ben Wikander, who had been in psychology class with him. Ben did not respond. According to news reports, he had been shot three times and underwent surgery on Thursday. Mr. Cruz entered the third-floor stairwell at 2:27 p.m., dropped the rifle and backpack, and ran down the stairs, eventually blending in with the fleeing students. Students began streaming off campus, running for their lives. Others remained holed up in classrooms, storage areas and bathrooms, unsure what to do as their panicking parents rushed as close to the blocked-off school as they could get. Cellphones erupted with instructions, pleas for help and rumors.      Andrew Gilroy, whose house is just behind the high school, received an alarming text from his 15-year-old son, William, a freshman, at 2:38 p.m. “I think theirs a shooter at school,” the text said. “We’re on lockdown. We’re in a closet.” Mr. Gilroy quickly responded: “OMG. Be smart.” William texted: “Do u hear sirens from our house?”  Mr. Gilroy went outside and stood atop a berm in his backyard, peering at the school through trees and shrubs for any clues about what was happening. He had not heard any shooting. Mr. Gilroy wrote: “Not yet … Tell everyone to be quiet … Oxygen and air. Noise discipline.” William replied a few minutes later: “OK. I heard they got him but I don’t know.” William texted again, saying that his friend Eric and some others were coming to the house to seek refuge. “So u know.” William was still hiding in a closet in a classroom in the Freshman Building. About 10 students showed up at the house. Two of them were crying and badly shaken up. The teenagers wanted to stay outside and watch things develop at the school from afar. Mr. Gilroy insisted that they all go inside. “I’m thinking that the shooter could be coming through here or there may be more than one shooter,” he said. “I told the kids, ‘Come in the house. We are locking this down.’” Mr. Gilroy discreetly armed himself with a 9-mm handgun. “Just in case,” he said. After leaving the school, Mr. Cruz walked to a Walmart down the road and bought a drink at a Subway. He also stopped at a McDonald’s across the street. Then, as he strolled down a quiet residential street less than half a mile away, where a couple of people were walking their dogs, he was spotted by a police officer. Michael Leonard had been called in from the neighboring city of Coconut Creek for the emergency, but he decided to peel away from the mass of patrols of the school to comb the nearby streets. “He looked like a typical high school student, and for a quick moment I thought, could this be the person who I need to stop?” Officer Leonard said of Mr. Cruz.  He wore a maroon shirt and black pants. The description matched. Officer Leonard pulled over. Mr. Cruz complied with orders and did not resist arrest. But the confusion and fear continued. Students still on campus waited long into the afternoon as the police swept the buildings and led them out. Delaney Tarr, a 17-year-old senior who was hiding with fellow students in a classroom closet, shrank in terror when a SWAT team entered around 3:45 p.m. “I think every person’s heart stopped when we heard noise,” Delaney said. “We didn’t know if it’s someone coming to help you or to kill you.” From afternoon to late in the evening, the parking lot in front of a nearby Marriott, a designated pickup point for parents, was packed with police vehicles. Mothers and fathers arrived ashen-faced. Some left with relieved smiles, reunited with their children. By 9:30 p.m., foot traffic had slowed, save for a few Red Cross volunteers bringing water and snacks to parents who were still inside the hotel, still waiting.

None,7," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 18, 2018, 5:58 P.M. E.D.T. WASHINGTON —  Parents of students who died in the Parkland, Florida, school shooting are calling for a range of steps to prevent gun violence, including measures to ""harden"" schools to minimize attacks and to identify potential shooters before they act. Max Schachter, whose son Alex was among 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February, urged national standards for school safety that include bulletproof glass and technology that allows teachers and other officials to communicate during a crisis. Schachter said he wasn't proposing that ""every school fence be 10 feet high"" but said practical steps can be taken to make schools safer and prevent future tragedies. Speaking Wednesday at a Capitol forum led by Florida's two U.S. senators, Schachter said airports and other public buildings must meet national standards, and he wondered why schools don't have to.  ""We have failed to protect our children,"" he said. Schachter and other parents of children killed in school shootings spoke at the two-hour forum along with law enforcement officials, educators and other experts.  Schachter, who created a foundation called Safe Schools for Alex, said his advocacy work since his 14-year-old son's death has been ""sobering, depressing and sometimes hopeful."" Ryan Petty, whose daughter Alaina died in the same room as Alex Schachter, focused on threat prevention, saying schools and law enforcement need clear guidelines to help identify potential school shooters before they act.      Petty urged a comprehensive approach that includes students and casts ""a very wide net to identify the potential attackers before they attack."" Florida Sens. Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson organized the forum, which focused on prevention of school violence, intervention and school safety and security. ""We want to see what works best,"" said Rubio, a Republican. Nelson, a Democrat, said lawmakers need to get to the root cause of gun violence. He called for comprehensive background checks for gun purchasers to ""catch all the nuances that you'd miss with just a criminal background check."" Nelson also called for a ban on semi-automatic weapons such as AR-15 and AK-47 rifles. ""They are not for hunting,"" he said. ""They are for killing."" Nelson, Rubio and other lawmakers promoted the Stop School Violence Act, which was approved last month as part of a comprehensive budget deal passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump. The budget deal includes nearly $2 billion to strengthen school safety through grants for training, security measures and treatment for the mentally ill. Rubio and Nelson also have introduced a separate bill to encourage states to adopt so-called red-flag laws that allow officials to keep guns away from people who show warning signs of violence. The Senate bill would essentially pay states to implement such laws, Rubio said.  ",2018-04-18,0.79557496,Wednesday

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. —  The parents of a 17-year-old student who was shot five times as he shielded others during the Parkland, Florida high school mass shooting on Tuesday filed the first lawsuit on behalf of a victim in the massacre that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others. The suit seeks a jury trial and an unspecified amount of damages from seven defendants, including Nikolas Cruz, 19, the accused killer in the Feb. 14 shooting rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Other defendants are the estate of Cruz's late mother, a Parkland couple who housed Cruz in the time immediately before the massacre and three mental health centers that evaluated and treated Cruz. The suit filed in Broward County Circuit Court charges Cruz with assault and battery and the other six defendants with negligence. Broward is the county where the shootings occurred.  The plaintiffs are the parents of Anthony Borges, who was hospitalized for more than a month after being shot three times in his legs and twice in his torso, the suit says. It also says Borges is confined to a wheelchair for the foreseeable future and requires constant care. In the criminal case against Cruz that has 17 first-degree murder counts and 17 attempted murder counts, a Broward Circuit judge has yet to determine if he has enough funds to pay for his own defense.

None,10," Supported by By The Associated Press DENVER — A planned national high school walkout for gun control on the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting Friday won't include student protests at the Colorado school that changed the way the nation viewed shootings. Just as it has done every year since the April 20, 1999, shooting killed 12 students and a teacher, Columbine High School will be closed, and students there will stick with their tradition of holding a day of service to commemorate the tragedy in a community that includes both those who have pushed for gun control and to arm teachers. Junior Kaylee Tyner, who helped organize a walkout at the school on March 14, said the anniversary is a day to remember those lost in the shooting and those they left behind and politicizing it could divide the community. ""Every other day can be a day to push for change,"" said Tyner, who wishes organizers of the national walkout had reached out to the Columbine community first. ""But that is a day to respect victims and their families."" In a letter to other high schools in its suburban Denver district earlier last week, current Columbine principal Scott Christy and the principal at the time of the massacre, Frank DeAngelis, suggested students join their tradition rather than participating in a walkout, noting that April ""has long been a time to respectfully remember our loss."" DeAngelis said he does not want to tell other schools nationally what to do. As an unofficial consultant to schools hit by shootings because of his experience, he said he has always told them to consider what their community wants, rather than follow a template. But if schools want to hold events to honor the Columbine victims on the anniversary, he said he would ask that they include a day of service since that is the practice at the suburban Denver school. The message has spread to other schools across the country, leading some to question whether they should participate in the national walkout, creating confusion even among students at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where the most recent school shooting massacre claimed 17 lives in February. Douglas junior Casey Sherman, who organized a march last month that was attended by thousands nationwide, says school administrators are trying to keep kids from walking out because of Columbine's request. ""We all want to support Columbine in whatever they hope for us to do, whether that be walking out during school or simply paying your respects quietly,"" she said. ""My understanding is that Columbine was conflicted themselves as to what direction they wanted to go with it and as a result their message initially came out as seemingly a bit confused."" ""I know that Douglas just wants to do right by them."" Douglas senior David Hogg, one of the leaders of the #NeverAgain movement, has sent some confusing directives on social media. In a now-deleted tweet on Monday, Hogg said he was wrong to have previously said that everyone should walk out on Friday no matter where they were, adding, ""This is what Columbine community would like to see on 4/20. #Day of Service"" Later that day, he tweeted ""We are still walking out however the Columbine community will be committing 4/20 to volunteering Once again we are still walking out We are still walking out We are still walking out We are still walking out @schoolwalkoutUS has been working incredibly hard on this."" Hogg has been encouraging students to walk out and register to vote. Some Columbine students compromised by holding a combined vigil and voter registration rally on Thursday night. About a thousand people, including a group of students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, gathered in a park near Columbine. Some held signs that read, ""Change Gun Laws,"" ''Change Congress"" and ""I Will Vote."" The National School Walkout website says nearly 2,500 walkouts are planned across the country on Friday, mostly at high schools but at some middle schools and colleges, including the University of Cambridge in Britain. The group's founder, 16-year-old sophomore Lane Murdock, who attends Ridgefield High School in Connecticut, says her organization has been in touch with friends and family of the Columbine community, saying ""we've been having a dialogue with them."" Murdock says it is ""awesome"" that Columbine is doing a service day, but that doesn't mean other students across the country should not follow through with the walkouts, which they've spent a lot of time planning over the past two months. ""Honestly, I just think they're different approaches to the same problem,"" said Murdock. ""This is their day and they've been working really hard and they deserve to raise their voice the way they see fit."" ____ Kennedy reported from Parkland, Florida.

National,11," By AUDRA D. S. BURCH, FRANCES ROBLES and PATRICIA MAZZEIFEB. 17, 2018 PARKLAND, Fla. — A Florida social services agency conducted an in-home investigation of Nikolas Cruz after he exhibited troubling behavior nearly a year and a half before he shot and killed 17 people at his former high school in Florida, a state report shows. The agency, the Florida Department of Children and Families, had been alerted to posts on Snapchat of Mr. Cruz cutting his arms and expressing interest in buying a gun, according to the report. But after visiting and questioning Mr. Cruz at his home, the department determined he was at low risk of harming himself or others. The report is the latest indication that Mr. Cruz was repeatedly identified by local and federal agencies as a troubled young man with violent tendencies. The F.B.I. admitted on Friday that it had failed to investigate a tip called into a hotline last month by a person close to Mr. Cruz identifying him as a gun owner intent on killing people, possibly at a school. The local police were called to Mr. Cruz’s house many times for disturbances over several years. Mr. Cruz also worried officials at his former school, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., who on at least one occasion alerted a mobile crisis unit to get him emergency counseling, according to the state report.  Broward County Public Schools disciplinary records obtained on Saturday by The New York Times show Mr. Cruz had a long history of fights with teachers, and was frequently accused of using profane language with school staff. He was referred for a “threat assessment” in January 2017, the last entry in his record, two months after the Department of Children and Families closed its separate investigation into Mr. Cruz’s worrisome behavior.  Howard Finkelstein, the Broward County public defender, whose office is representing Mr. Cruz, said the report was further evidence that Mr. Cruz needed serious help long before the shooting but did not get enough of it. “This kid exhibited every single known red flag, from killing animals to having a cache of weapons to disruptive behavior to saying he wanted to be a school shooter,” Mr. Finkelstein said. “If this isn’t a person who should have gotten someone’s attention, I don’t know who is. This was a multisystem failure.” The state agency investigated whether Mr. Cruz intended to harm himself in September 2016, when he made the alarming social media posts after an argument with his mother. Mr. Cruz, who had depression, was upset over a breakup with a girlfriend, his mother, Lynda Cruz, told investigators. The report does not say who called in the complaint, which was given “immediate” priority. The report shows that investigators closed the case about two months later. The agency determined that the “final level of risk is low” — an analysis that one of Mr. Cruz’s counselors at his school felt was premature — because his mother was caring for him, he was enrolled in school and he was receiving counseling. By the time of the shooting, however, Mr. Cruz had lost at least two of those elements: His mother was dead, and he had left Stoneman Douglas High School. It is unclear if he was still seeing a counselor. On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz, 19, showed up at Stoneman Douglas and unleashed more than 100 rounds from a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle he purchased last February, five months after the state investigation closed. As of Saturday evening, two Broward hospitals were still treating four patients in fair condition, according to Jennifer Smith, a spokeswoman. The office of Mr. Finkelstein, the public defender, suggested that it had offered prosecutors a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of parole. “Everybody knows he is guilty. What we are saying is, let’s put him away for life,” Mr. Finkelstein said. “We are not saying the death penalty is not justified; we are saying, let’s not put this community through the trauma and pain of a trial knowing that, three years down the road, one juror could keep him from being put to death.”  In Florida, the death penalty requires a decision by a unanimous jury. Michael J. Satz, the state attorney, said prosecutors would announce their position on the death penalty “at the appropriate time.” “This certainly is the type of case the death penalty was designed for,” Mr. Satz said in a statement. “This was a highly calculated and premeditated murder of 17 people and the attempted murder of everyone in that school.” Mr. Cruz’s school disciplinary records show he attended at least six schools, including Cross Creek School, a school for students with emotional problems; Dave Thomas Education Center, an alternative high school for at-risk youth; and an adult education center. He was first identified as developmentally delayed in 2002, when he was 4 years old. In incidents that began in 2012, when Mr. Cruz was 13, he was disciplined for being disobedient and unruly. In 2013, the records suggest, he was counseled for making a false 911 call. He was suspended several times in the 2016-17 school year, his last year at Stoneman Douglas, and was frequently reported for prolonged and unexplained absences. In September 2016, he was suspended for two days for fighting, only to return and get suspended again nine days after the fight, this time for hurling profane insults.      That same month, the Department of Children and Families began its investigation into Mr. Cruz. The investigation, first reported by The Sun-Sentinel of South Florida on Friday, was obtained by The Times on Saturday. The state agency had petitioned a court on Friday to make the confidential records public, but the court has yet to do so. “Mental health services and supports were in place when this investigation closed,” Mike Carroll, the secretary of the Department of Children and Families, said in a statement. Mr. Cruz was investigated as an adult, and the investigation appeared aimed at determining whether he was being neglected. Agency investigators identified Mr. Cruz, who had turned 18 a few days earlier, as a “vulnerable adult due to mental illness.” In addition to depression, Mr. Cruz had autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, the report said. He was regularly taking medication for the A.D.H.D. It was unclear whether he was taking anything for the depression, according to the report. After the argument with his mother, an investigator visited the family’s home in Parkland, which was clean, clutter-free and did not present any foul odors. The investigator did not see the cuts on Mr. Cruz’s arms: He was wearing long sleeves.  “Mr. Cruz stated that he plans to go out and buy a gun,” the report states. “It is unknown what he is buying the gun for.” His mother denied that she and her son had argued. She told the investigator that Mr. Cruz did not have a gun, though he did have an air gun she would take away from him when he did not follow rules about shooting only at backyard targets. His mother, who died in November, told investigators she attributed Mr. Cruz’s behavior to “a breakup with a girl.” Ms. Cruz “stated that she and the girl’s mother told the kids they had to end the relationship because it was unhealthy for everyone,” the report said. Neither the girl nor her mother are named in the report. A year before, it was discovered that Mr. Cruz had a Nazi symbol and a racial slur on his book bag. His mother said that when she confronted her son about it, Mr. Cruz purported to not know what the sign meant, and she said the family had never expressed negative sentiments toward people of other races. She made him clean it off his bag. The report noted that a mental health center had been contacted in the past to detain Mr. Cruz under Florida’s Baker Act, which allows the state to hospitalize people for several days if they are a threat to themselves or others. The center determined that he was not such a threat. Had Mr. Cruz been involuntarily committed, state law could have prohibited him from buying a firearm. The mental health counselor, from Henderson Behavioral Health, had also visited Mr. Cruz at home and had him sign a safety contract. Despite the assessment, a school counselor remained concerned. “She said Henderson found him stable enough not to be hospitalized,” the Department of Children and Families investigator wrote of the school counselor. “She stated that the concern she and the other staff had was to ensure that the assessment of Henderson was not premature.” Henderson Behavioral Health would not comment on Saturday. Neither the mental health counselor nor the school counselor could be reached.  According to the report, investigators also tried to speak to a school police officer, who declined to cooperate. The Department of Children and Families would have had no way to know if Mr. Cruz’s behavior became more erratic after losing his mother because the agency is not automatically notified of a caretaker’s death, said George Sheldon, a former department secretary. “It’s hard to second-guess because we don’t know everything that the department knew at the time, but clearly this young man was showing serious signs of a mental health disorder, something that does not pop up overnight,” said Mr. Sheldon, who left the department in 2011 and now oversees a nonprofit foster-care agency in Miami. “He was troubled and about to explode.

National,12," By AUDRA D. S. BURCH and PATRICIA MAZZEIFEB. 14, 2018 Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., hid in closets as a gunman fired a semiautomatic weapon into their classrooms. Seventeen people were killed. PARKLAND, Fla. — A heavily armed young man barged into his former high school about an hour northwest of Miami on Wednesday, opening fire on terrified students and teachers and leaving a death toll of 17 that could rise even higher, the authorities said. Students huddled in horror in their classrooms, with some of them training their cellphones on the carnage, capturing sprawled bodies, screams and gunfire that began with a few shots and then continued with more and more. The dead included students and adults, some of whom were shot outside the school and others inside the sprawling three-story building. The gunman, armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle, was identified as Nikolas Cruz, a 19-year-old who had been expelled from the school, the authorities said. He began his shooting rampage outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in this suburban neighborhood shortly before dismissal time around 2:40 p.m. He then made his way inside and proceeded down hallways he knew well, firing at students and teachers who were scurrying for cover, the authorities said. “Oh my God! Oh my God!” one student yelled over and over in one video circulating on social media, as more than 40 gunshots boomed in the background. By the end of the rampage, Mr. Cruz had killed 12 people inside the school and three outside it, including someone standing on a street corner, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. Two more victims died of their injuries in local hospitals. The aftermath at the school was an eerie shrine, with chairs upended, a computer screen shattered with bullet holes and floors stained with blood. On Thursday, the authorities charged Mr. Cruz with 17 counts of premeditated murder. “This is catastrophic,” said Sheriff Israel, who has three children who graduated from the high school. “There really are no words.” Mr. Cruz was arrested in Coral Springs, a neighboring city a couple of miles from the school, about an hour after fleeing the scene, the authorities said. He had slipped out of the building by mixing in with crowds of students. In addition to the rifle, Sheriff Israel said Mr. Cruz had “countless magazines.” The gunman had clearly prepared for the attack, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said in an interview after speaking to the F.B.I. 
                A gunman armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifle and “countless magazines” killed at least 17 people at his former high school on Wednesday.             “The shooter wore a gas mask, had smoke grenades, and he set off the fire alarm so the kids would come out of the classrooms,” said Mr. Nelson, citing details he learned from the F.B.I. Several students said they found it strange to hear the alarm, because they had already had a fire drill earlier in the day. Sheriff Israel said he did not know the gunman’s motive. He said a football coach was among the dead, and the son of a deputy sheriff among the injured. Twelve of the 17 dead had been identified by Wednesday night, he added, noting that not all of the students had backpacks or wallets on them. Mr. Cruz was enrolled at another Broward County school, officials said. Sheriff Israel said law enforcement officials had already discovered material on Mr. Cruz’s social media accounts that was “very, very disturbing.” Jim Gard, a math teacher at the school, said Mr. Cruz was in his class in 2016 and appeared to be a “quiet” student. But Mr. Gard also recalled that “there was concern” about his behavior on the part of the school administration, which emailed teachers relaying those fears. 
                Since 26 people were killed in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, a nonprofit that tracks school shootings has recorded five a month, on average.             Mr. Gard said that after the shooting, he learned from several students that Mr. Cruz was obsessed with a girl at the school to the point of “stalking her,” a point the authorities did not raise in news briefings near the scene. The massacre called to mind the country’s two mass shootings that have come to be known by the name of the schools: Columbine, the high school outside Denver where 12 students and a teacher were killed in 1999; and Sandy Hook, the elementary school in Newtown, Conn., where 20 students and six adults were shot dead in 2012. More than 40 “active shooter” episodes in schools have been recorded in the United States since 2000, according to F.B.I. and news reports. Two 15-year-old students were killed and 18 more people were injured last month in a school in rural Benton, Ky. The shootings have become common enough that many schools, including Stoneman Douglas High, run annual drills in which students practice huddling in classrooms behind locked doors. With the Parkland shooting, three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern United States history have come in the last five months. Mr. Nelson said the episode made him relive recent shootings that also shook the state. “Forty-nine slaughtered at the Pulse nightclub. Another handful slaughtered at the Fort Lauderdale airport, just a year ago, in the same county where this took place,” he said. “And that’s just Florida.” After the gunfire had stopped Wednesday afternoon and Mr. Cruz had fled, students ran out of the school, some in single file with their hands on the shoulders of those in front of them and others in all-out sprints. As the students sought cover, law enforcement officers armed with military-grade weapons swarmed the building. Parents rushed to a local Marriott hotel to reunite with their children. “I tried to stay calm. Students were running everywhere,” said Dianna Milleret, a 16-year-old sophomore who heard the gunshots. Noelle Kaiser, 17, was in history class when a fire alarm went off. The class was gathered just outside the building when she heard three distinct gunshots. The AR-15 assault rifle, and others like it, is commonly used in mass shootings in the United States. Here's a closer look at likely reasons. “I am in shock,” she said softly after clutching her mother, Cheryl Kaiser, on the sidewalk outside the school. Seventeen patients were treated in three area hospitals, including two who died, said Dr. Evan Boyar of the Broward Health System. All suffered gunshot wounds. “Words cannot express the sorrow that we feel,” said Robert W. Runcie, the Broward schools superintendent. “No parent should ever have to send their kid to school and have them not return.” Parkland, an affluent suburb of Fort Lauderdale with a population of about 30,000, is known for its good public schools. Stoneman Douglas High is among the largest in the Broward school district, with about 3,000 students. The school will remain closed for the rest of the week. Gov. Rick Scott directed the state to lower its flags at half-staff until Monday. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     “My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting,” President Trump wrote on Twitter. “No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.” As the authorities frantically searched for the person responsible, they asked residents of the city to avoid the area around the school. For hours, parents were lined along Coral Springs Drive, calling their children on cellphones and pacing. Some parents said their children told them only to text to not make noise. One parent of two daughters at a nearby middle school said he sat in a bank lobby near the school and prayed. The gunfire came as some students were still staring at chalkboards and listening to lectures. Rebecca Bogart, 17, a senior, said her teacher was finishing up a discussion of the Holocaust when she heard a series of loud bangs. “We all got on the floor and under the desk,” said Ms. Bogart, who was still shaking outside the school. “It felt like we were there 10 or 15 minutes and then shots came through the window and the glass shattered.” She couldn’t see her classmates fall, but she could see at least five were bleeding, one in the head and one in the leg. “I was trying to keep calm and my friend was holding my hand to keep it from shaking,” she said. When the authorities arrived, they took out her wounded classmates first. “There was blood all over the floor,” she said, “You never think something like this is going to happen to you and then it does.” Audra D.S.

National,13," By RICHARD FAUSSET and SERGE F. KOVALESKIFEB. 15, 2018 Nikolas Cruz, shown with a public defender, was ordered to be held in jail without bond. PARKLAND, Fla. — Before he was hauled into a jailhouse hearing room on Thursday, head bowed and shackled at the wrists and ankles, Nikolas Cruz had been causing trouble as long as anyone here could remember. Neighbors said patrol cars were regularly in his mother’s driveway. More recently, Mr. Cruz, 19, had been expelled from his high school. He posted pictures of weapons and dead animals on social media. Almost immediately after Mr. Cruz turned up at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., Wednesday and, the authorities said, killed 17 people with a semiautomatic rifle, the disconnected shards of a difficult life began to come together. Students and neighbors traded stories of their experiences with him and wondered if anything could have been done. Some of the stories fell within the bands of typical teenage mischief-making. But others — including a comment on YouTube Mr. Cruz may have posted last year saying he wished to be “a professional school shooter” — were considerably more troubling. The comment, left under the name “nikolas cruz,” was reported to the F.B.I. by someone who did not know Mr. Cruz, and the agency said on Thursday that it had been unable to determine who had posted it. 
                Arrest documents released Thursday by the Broward County Sheriff's Office for Nikolas Cruz, who faces 17 counts of premeditated murder in the school shooting in Parkland, Fla.             Mr. Cruz was taken into custody shortly after the massacre, and was booked on 17 counts of premeditated murder. He confessed to the shootings, according to an arrest affidavit. When he appeared via a jailhouse video hookup for his first court appearance on Thursday, the judge asked him whether he understood his circumstances. “Yes, ma’am,” he whispered. The authorities released the names of all 17 victims on Thursday. They were teachers and students, the kinds of people who bring a school to life: a popular football coach who himself had gone to the school, a soccer player, a trombonist in the marching band. Lori Alhadeff, the mother of one of the victims, Alyssa Alhadeff, 14, said she had a message for President Trump. “President Trump, we need action, we need change,” she said, tears streaming down her face. “Get these guns out of the hands of these young kids and get these guns off the streets.” The president, who generally opposes new gun restrictions, has focused on mental illness during mass shootings, and did so again on Thursday, beginning with a post on Twitter. 
            So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!         Later, in his televised address, Mr. Trump said he planned to work with state and local leaders to “tackle the difficult issue of mental health.” On Thursday night, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, told CNN that he would “do everything I can to make sure this never happens again.” At a candlelight vigil Thursday night for the 17 people killed in a Florida school shooting, attendees chanted, “No more guns.” Pressed repeatedly as to whether he would commit to tightening gun restrictions in his state, Mr. Scott said that he would be “strong on that,” and that “everything is on the table.” But he also made clear that there were “a lot of things” at play, such as who should have guns, how to make schools safer, and how to make it easier for children to report problems. Mr. Cruz had no criminal history before the shootings, according to state law enforcement records. But his childhood was certainly troubled. He spent much of it in a subdivision called Pine Tree Estates, on a lush, narrow street dotted with tropical plants and the occasional driveway basketball hoop. Mr. Cruz and his brother, Zachary, had been adopted, and were raised largely by their mother, Lynda Cruz, especially after their father, Roger P. Cruz, died suddenly in 2004 at the age of 67. Ms. Cruz died in November, and people who knew Nikolas said he had taken the loss hard. Paul Gold, 45, said he lived next door to the Cruzes in 2009 and 2010 and stayed in touch with Lynda Cruz over the years. “He had emotional problems and I believe he was diagnosed with autism,” Mr. Gold said of Nikolas Cruz. “He had trouble controlling his temper. He broke things. He would do that sometimes at our house when he lost his temper. But he was always very apologetic afterwards.” He added: “He would sometimes be hitting his head and covering his ears. One time, I sent him home because he was misbehaving at our house and he took a golf club and smashed one of my trailers.” He said that Mr. Cruz at one point had gone to a school for students with special needs. “Kids were really picking on him and would gang up on him and beat him up a little,” Mr. Gold said. “They ostracized him. He didn’t have many friends.” He said that Mr. Cruz’s mother had done what she could to take care of him, and that the two had an extremely strong bond. “His mother was his entire life and when he lost her, I believe that was it for the boy’s peace of mind,” he said. Other neighbors said Mr. Cruz was a regular source of agitation. Helen Pasciolla said Lynda Cruz had called sheriff’s deputies to the house numerous times in an effort to keep Mr. Cruz in line. Craig Koblitz, 62, a yacht repairman who lives across the street, said some neighbors had suspected him of burglarizing a nearby house a few years ago. About six years ago, Mr. Koblitz returned to his home to find Mr. Cruz scooping the fish from the pond in his palm-shaded front yard. He found it odd that the boy did not seem to express much surprise or guilt over being caught stealing. Just hours after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., students turned to social media to advocate for more gun control. Sarah Edelsberg, 16, remembered being frightened by Mr. Cruz when they were in middle school together. Mr. Cruz would walk by her and her friends and shout at them — randomly and menacingly, she said, with wild gestures of his arms. She said he was small of build, wore a constant smirk and seemed eager to provoke confrontations. Teachers, she said, sometimes dealt with his behavior problems by forcing him to sit outside their portable classrooms. The authorities said Mr. Cruz was expelled from Stoneman Douglas last year. Victoria Olvera, a 17-year-old junior, told The Associated Press that Mr. Cruz had gotten into a fight with his ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend.      But Michael Goldfarb, whose 17-year-old son Bradley knew Mr. Cruz, said his son had told him Mr. Cruz was expelled for having a knife at school. Last year, Mr. Goldfarb said, his son went on a three-day trip to a cabin in the Everglades with other young men, including Mr. Cruz. They were accompanied by a parent who owned the cabin. Shooting weapons was a big part of the trip’s allure. There were two AR-15s on the trip, and Mr. Cruz brought one of them. He bragged about how he had bought it from a pawnshop, Mr. Goldfarb said, speaking for his son. (The authorities said the gun had been legally purchased from a gun shop.) The YouTube comment appeared last fall on the channel of Ben Bennight, a bail bondsman in Mississippi. “I’m going to be a professional school shooter,” the Sept. 24 comment said, under the user name “nikolas cruz.” Mr. Bennight took a screenshot and flagged it to YouTube, which removed the post. Then, Mr. Bennight said, he left a voice mail message at his local F.B.I. office alerting them about the comment. Mr. Bennight, 36, said on Thursday that a pair of agents interviewed him the next morning. But the F.B.I. never learned who posted the comment. “No other information was included in the comment which would indicate a particular time, location, or the true identity of the person who posted the comment,” the F.B.I. said in a statement on Thursday. The F.B.I. said it had conducted database reviews and other checks. After his expulsion, Mr. Cruz took a job at a dollar store near his old school. Ms. Edelsberg said she had seen him there a number of times. Now, she said, he seemed less scary than friendly. He asked her for news from Stoneman Douglas. On Thursday, Jordan Jereb, a leader of a white supremacist group based in North Florida, told The Associated Press that Mr. Cruz had joined the group, but later Mr. Jereb said that he did not know whether that was true. The family of another schoolmate, the Snead family, took in Mr. Cruz because his friend felt badly that Mr. Cruz was now alone in the world, said Jim Lewis, a lawyer for the family. The Sneads had allowed Mr. Cruz to bring his gun with him to their house, insisting that he keep it in a lockbox. On weekday mornings, Mr. Cruz usually got up to catch a ride to adult education courses that the Sneads had encouraged him to attend. But on Wednesday, he refused to get up, Mr. Lewis said. Mr. Lewis said Mr. Cruz had said something to the effect of: “I don’t go to school on Valentine’s Day.” Howard Finkelstein, the chief public defender in Broward County, said in an interview that Mr. Cruz’s legal team had not yet decided whether to mount an insanity defense. Prosecutors have not said whether they will seek the death penalty, but Mr. Finkelstein argued that Mr. Cruz should not be a candidate for execution, given his mental health history. “Every red flag was there and nobody did anything,” Mr. Finkelstein said. “When we let one of our children fall off grid, when they are screaming for help in every way, do we have the right to kill them when we could have stopped it?” On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz and the Sneads’ son were texting until 2:18 p.m., Mr. Lewis said — about five minutes before the first 911 calls about the shooting. “But there was nothing crazy in the texts,” Mr. Lewis said. Mr. Cruz arrived at the school in a small, gold-colored Uber, according to the booking report from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office. He was wearing a black hat, with a black duffel and a black backpack. Within a minute there were gunshots. Later, in custody, Mr. Cruz told investigators that “he was the gunman who entered the school campus armed with an AR-15 and began shooting students that he saw in the hallways and on the school grounds,” the report said. The police would find him an hour later in the nearby city of Coral Springs. In the report, Mr. Cruz said he had slipped away from the campus by ditching the gun and the extra magazines he brought along, joining the crowd of worried students fleeing the school. Unarmed and anonymous, Mr. Cruz, finally, had blended in among them. Richard Fausset reported from Parkland, and Serge F. Kovaleski from New York.

Express,14," By JONAH ENGEL BROMWICHMARCH 27, 2018 One was Photoshopped tearing up the Constitution — a falsehood — and criticized for wearing a flag that represented her Cuban heritage. A conservative blog said that another wasn’t even at the school during the killings — then had to backtrack on Monday when that also proved false. The attacks on the teenage survivors of the shooting in Parkland, Fla., have been fierce from the beginning, and have only continued since the students helped spearhead hundreds of protests this weekend. Two of the most vocal survivors, Emma González, 18, and David Hogg, 17, have been targets of a disproportionate amount of vitriol.  In an interview Tuesday, Mr. Hogg said they had been singled out because of their prominence and emphasized that ad hominem attacks would not end school shootings.  “I mean, we’re kind of the faces of the movement,” he said. “Together we kind of form an unstoppable force that terrifies them.” He added that he and Ms. González were being attacked “because they know we’re strong.” Here are a few of the recent attempts to discredit the students. RedState, a conservative blog, ran an “update” Monday evening to a story it had published that questioned whether Mr. Hogg was present at Marjory Stoneman Douglas during the day of the shooting. Sarah Rumpf, a writer for RedState, had questioned Mr. Hogg after watching an interview where he said he rode his bike to the school on the day of the shooting to interview his classmates. The bike trip was described in a Vox article written in February. It indicated that Mr. Hogg had been at school during the shooting, as widely confirmed by many news organizations. He had left campus and then rode his bike back that evening to interview classmates. Video has shown that Mr. Hogg was in a closet during the shooting. Ms. Rumpf eventually found the article and video, and apologized. RedState struck through the old article, but did not describe the update as a correction, seeming to blame the misinformation on confusing reports elsewhere. The false report was spread by well-known conservatives, including Erick Erickson, who has contributed to The New York Times opinion section. Mr. Erickson later deleted his original tweet. 
            I tweeted @rumpfshaker’s story last night that she had gotten wrong. I deleted it when it became clear she got it wrong and I posted the correction. This will be the basis of a WaPo story attacking conservatives for not being sympathetic to the gun-control zealots from Parkland.         The doctored image of Ms. González ripping apart the Constitution of the United States, began to spread during the march on Saturday. It was falsified from a Teen Vogue image in which she was pictured ripping apart a paper shooting target.  The image, which exists in a gray area between meme and misinformation, was promoted on Gab, the alt-right alternative to Twitter, and by the right-wing actor Adam Baldwin. Some claimed the image to be satire, and similar memes of President Trump and other political figures appear across the spectrum. But the political scientist Emily Thorson has pointed out that their spread contributes to a climate of misinformation, even if those who see the images understand them to be fake. Steve King, the Republican congressman from Iowa, posted on Facebook about the Cuban flag sewn to Ms. González’s jacket. “This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish,” the post said, “and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self-defense.” It showed an image of her with the flag patch visible on her jacket. The post and similar ones angered other survivors of gun violence and even some of Mr. King’s fellow conservatives, who pointed out that the Cuban flag has long been used by dissidents from the Castro regime. 
            Lots of misinformation going around about this, so I’ll try to set it straight.Cuba’s flag has been used by the country since 1902, before they adopted communism. It’s even regularly displayed in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood – where the people are no fans of Castro. pic.twitter.com/7frhMzvEdP         Ms. González retweeted Mr. Hogg’s response to Mr. King: “She’s a beautiful woman of Cuban descent and we love her. You would too if you ever got the chance to meet her.” She also retweeted another of Mr. Hogg’s tweets, which called on Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican of Florida of Cuban descent, to respond to Mr. King. 
            Hey @marcorubio @Emma4Change s family fled Cuba to escape totalitarianism and live in freedom just like your family could you please respond to @SteveKingIA         The conservative writer and commentator Dan McLaughlin suggested that reporters ask Ms. González “what the flag means to her and why she wears it.” She did not respond to a call Tuesday.  Many attacks on the Parkland students do not even pretend to focus on issues or substance. They include the false conspiracy trope that the students are paid actors. Sometimes their appearances and intelligence are mocked, including their efforts to get accepted to colleges this spring. On Sunday, the conservative podcaster and vocal Trump supporter Bill Mitchell referred to Mr. Hogg as a “Damien, Children of the Corn, Hitler-Youth type” on Twitter. The vitriol has sometimes backfired. A Republican candidate for the Maine State House dropped out of the race after calling Ms. González a “skinhead lesbian” and Mr. Hogg a “moron” and a “baldfaced liar.” In a Tuesday interview, Nicole Hockley, whose young son Dylan was killed in the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn., advised the students to ignore the attacks as much as possible. She recalled that she had faced conspiracy theories and personal attacks after her 6-year-old son was killed along with 19 other first graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School. She remembered how that felt: “All I’m trying to do is make it so this doesn’t happen to other people and you’re attacking me without a lot of basis.” She said that it was also important to hear rational criticism when trying to find common ground on the issues. When dealing with more reasonable opponents and critics she tries to de-escalate the conversations, she said, to learn more about what they think and educate them about her views. “Sometimes there’s a new perspective that I haven’t considered,” she said, though she rarely finds such views persuasive. Still, she said, those conversations “can bear a lot of fruit.” Follow Jonah Bromwich on Twitter: @Jonesieman.  See More » ",2018-03-27,0.7522051,Tuesday
None,15," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 13, 2018, 5:52 P.M. E.D.T. FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. —  A resource officer at a Florida elementary school jumped into action Feb. 14 after hearing a colleague scream ""shots fired"" at a nearby high school where 17 were killed, reports released Friday said. In response to continuing public records requests from local and national news outlets, the Broward Sheriff's Office released a new batch of deputy reports about the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. The details come after the Stoneman Douglas resource officer faced intense criticism for not entering the building during the shooting. He has since resigned. The Riverglades Elementary School resource officer drove 4 miles (6 km) to the school, pulled an AR-15 from the trunk and changed it from ""ammo ready"" to ""threat ready"" mode.""  As the deputy moved toward the freshmen building, the deputy saw one victim dead on the ground, someone the deputy knew personally. The report doesn't name the deputy or victim. Many details were blacked out in the 30-page document dump.  The Riverglades resource officer used a golf cart to drive an injured male to a triage area. The victim had trouble sitting up and ""needed to be supported."" The deputy reported leaning over the seat and holding onto the victim until they arrived. ""I only gave him words of encouragement that he was going to survive"" the deputy said. The victim didn't reply. The deputy then returned to the freshmen building, searching for the suspect and securing the building before extricating other victims from the smoke-filled crime scene. Once finished, the deputy's arms, uniform and rifle were covered in the victims' blood. A former student, Nikolas Cruz, 19, is charged with killing 17 people and wounding 17 others in the Feb. 14 mass shooting. The newly released documents include narratives from about 10 deputies. Several described the carnage they witnessed as they searched the school. One responding deputy reported hearing gunshots after arriving at the high school. The deputy was responding to radio reports of an active shooter from the high school's resource officer, now-former deputy Scot Peterson. Two students screamed ""active shooter!"" as they ran past the deputy, and shortly behind them was teacher helping a student who had been shot in the leg.      The deputy went to the building where the shooter had opened fire and saw a body just outside. Another officer checked the person's pulse and proclaimed him dead as several officers from the Coral Springs Police Department rushed toward the building. Officers were coming in from the opposite side of the building so, worried about crossfire, the Broward deputy attended to the body nearby but also found no pulse.  ""He appeared to have an injury to the back of his head,"" the deputy wrote. Another responding Broward deputy described joining with other officers when at the building where the shooting occurred. ""I could see smoke in the air and victims on the ground,"" the deputy wrote. The deputy and the others began immediately assisting wounded people. On the third floor, they found three victims on the ground, one of whom was trying to lift his arm. ""We went to the victim and brought him back to the west side stair case where he was evacuated,"" the deputy wrote. ""The other two victims were deceased."" The officers began evacuating the wounded and others as quickly as possible. Several deputies described smelling smoke and seeing bullet shell casings on the building's floor. ""We found one adult woman hiding in a locked office,"" one deputy wrote in a report. ""Some windows had to be shattered in order to gain entry into some of the locked classrooms where students and faculty were found to be hiding."" After SWAT teams cleared the building of students and had it secure, the deputies and officers were still surrounded by the bodies of the fallen teachers and students. ""As I walked out the door I could see the body of (redacted) to my left and an unidentified girl to my right,"" a deputy wrote. ""Both were deceased."" A deputy responding from nearby Tamarac was among the first officers to enter Building 12. ""I entered ... and immediately detected the odor of gun powder and observed several people lying in the hallway in pools of blood,"" the deputy wrote."" ___ Associated Press writers David Fischer in Miami and Jason Dearen in Gainesville contributed to this story.

National,16," By ALAN BLINDERMARCH 13, 2018 A Florida prosecutor said Tuesday that he would seek the death penalty against the man accused of killing 17 people last month at a high school in Parkland, moving the state closer to a rare trial for someone charged in a mass shooting. Michael J. Satz, the state attorney for Broward County, made his decision public less than a month after the rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and one day before students nationwide were expected to stage walkouts to demand new gun-control measures. The decision to seek the death penalty against Nikolas Cruz, 19, was widely expected, in part because Mr. Satz had hinted at his plans days after the attack. Lawyers for Mr. Cruz, who have repeatedly said that he would plead guilty in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of parole, are not expected to contest his guilt at what is certain to be an agonizing and emotional trial. They will instead focus on proving mitigating circumstances, such as extreme mental duress, that could persuade a single juror to block a death sentence. But in a filing in Circuit Court in Broward County, Mr. Satz cited seven aggravating factors that he said prosecutors would prove and that would make Mr. Cruz eligible for execution. Those factors, enshrined in Florida law, include that Mr. Cruz “knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons” and that the capital felony at issue was “especially heinous, atrocious or cruel.”  Mr. Satz, whose state has 347 people on its death row, had no comment beyond the court filing. In a statement last month, though, he said the attack at Stoneman Douglas High “certainly is the type of case the death penalty was designed for.”  Howard Finkelstein, the public defender for Broward County and one of Mr. Cruz’s lawyers, said Tuesday that Mr. Cruz remained “ready to immediately plead guilty.” Mr. Cruz has chosen to stand mute, which in Florida effectively amounts to a not guilty plea, rather than disputing his guilt in the massacre.      “We are not saying he is not guilty,” Mr. Finkelstein said, “but we can’t plead guilty while death is still on the table.” Mr. Cruz has been indicted on 34 counts: 17 of premeditated murder in the first degree, and 17 of attempted murder in the first degree. Relatively few suspects are ever brought to trial for mass shootings. Among the suspects in the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern American history, only Mr. Cruz, a former Stoneman Douglas High student, was apprehended alive. And prosecutors have amassed something of a mixed record in trials involving mass killings. Last year, for example, a federal jury condemned the white supremacist Dylann S. Roof to death for killing nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C. But in 2015, a Colorado jury spared the life of James E. Holmes, who killed 12 people at a movie theater in Aurora.

National,17," By JULIE TURKEWITZ, AUDRA D. S. BURCH and LIAM STACKFEB. 15, 2018 PARKLAND, Fla. — For the latest on the Florida school shooting, read Friday’s live updates. Just 24 hours after a shooting that turned this city numb, Lori Alhadeff stood near 17 cream-colored angels with gold wings that lined the park stage where a vigil was held Thursday night. One of those angels represented her daughter, Alyssa, 14, who was killed in the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Trembling, she said she was there for her daughter, and she was there to talk to anyone who would listen. “My daughter is dead, but all these children out here have to go to school. A shooter should not be able to just walk in,” she said, tears streaming down her face. “I hope she didn’t die for nothing.” All around this stricken community, residents were honoring the 17 victims, supporting the survivors, some of them still in hospital beds, and trying to make sense of a tragedy that had no logic. At a candlelight vigil Thursday night for the 17 people killed in a Florida school shooting, attendees chanted, “No more guns.” Among the grieving were broad-shouldered football players, who lost teammates, a popular assistant coach and the school’s athletic director. As the sun set, they formed a circle and locked hands with former players, praying for those who would never play again. They spoke of their dead coach, Aaron Feis, 37, who was also the school security guard and would greet students at the gate each morning, sitting in his golf cart with a thumbs-up and a smile. “He cared about us as people, not just as football players,” said William Pringle, 17, who had just escaped the school with a friend when they learned that their beloved coach had not. Tyler Goodman, 18, the quarterback, had seen the coach just before the shooting. “I love you, Coach,” Mr. Goodman recalls saying. It was Valentine’s Day, after all. “I love you, too, Bub,” Mr. Feis replied. “I’ll see you at 2:30.” It was the last Mr. Goodman ever saw of him. During the horror, Carly Novell, a 17-year-old senior who is an editor for the school’s quarterly magazine, The Eagle Eye, hid in a closet and thought about an awful family tragedy from before she was born. Her mother had told her about how her grandfather had survived a mass shooting in 1949 in Camden, N.J. His family had not made it. Just hours after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., students turned to social media to advocate for more gun control. “My grandfather was 12, and his grandma and his mom and dad were killed while he hid in a closet,” Ms. Novell said. “They heard gunshots on the street, so my great-grandma told my grandpa to hide in the closet, so he was safe. But he didn’t have a family after that.” Interviewed on Thursday, she said: “I was thinking of him while I was in the closet. I was wondering what he felt like while he was there. My mom has told me he was in shock after it, too — that he didn’t remember how he got to the police station, or anything like that. I didn’t forget anything, but I was in shock and I didn’t understand what was going on.” She was not the only one struggling to make sense of the shooting rampage, which the authorities say was carried out by a former student, Nikolas Cruz, who appeared to have an obsession with guns. Huddled elsewhere in the school as Mr. Cruz stalked the hallways was David Hogg, 17, a lanky senior and aspiring journalist. He turned on the video recorder on his phone and pointed it at classmates hiding with him in a dark classroom. “So, what’s your message?” he asked. One after another, his classmates responded. “I personally have rallied for gun rights,” said one female student, her voice shaky, but forceful. “I wanted to be a junior N.R.A. member, I wanted to learn how to hunt,” she said. “But to have the bullet pointed at me, my school, my classmates, my teachers, my mentors, it’s definitely eye-opening to the fact that we need more gun control in our country.”      The gunman was still at large, and yet those in hiding kept trying to make sense of it all. “If you looked around this closet and saw everyone just hiding together, you would know that this shouldn’t be happening any more,” said another female student, her eyes wide and fear visible on her face. Interviewed later, Mr. Hogg offered remarks that captured the sentiments of many of his classmates. “On a national scale, I’m not surprised at all,” he said. “And that’s just sad. The fact that a student is not surprised that there was another mass shooting — but this time it was at his school — says so much about the current state that our country is in, and how much has to be done.” The violence must stop, he said. “We need to do something. We need to get out there and be politically active,” he said. “Congress needs to get over their political bias with each other and work toward saving children’s lives.” Expressing his frustration on CNN, he said: “We’re children. You guys are the adults.” Julie Turkewitz and Audra S. Burch reported from Parkland, Fla., and Liam Stack from New York. Niraj Chokshi contributed reporting from New York.

Express,18," By MATTHEW HAAGAPRIL 3, 2018 Shortly after a gunman entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida in February and killed 17 people, the conspiracy theory website Infowars claimed it had a photo of the attacker wearing “communist garb.” It showed a young man with a clenched fist in a red shirt emblazoned with a hammer and sickle and images of Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx. But that man was not Nikolas Cruz, who was arrested two miles from the Parkland, Fla., school on Feb. 14 and later confessed to the shooting, the police said. The man in the red shirt was Marcel Fontaine, who lives 1,200 miles away in Massachusetts and has never visited Florida. On Monday, Mr. Fontaine filed a defamation lawsuit against Infowars, one of its reporters and its right-wing founder, Alex Jones, asserting that their story misidentified him as the gunman and caused his photo to spread across social media, message boards and other websites. In the lawsuit, a lawyer for Mr. Fontaine said it appeared that Infowars published his photo simply because of his shirt. “Mr. Jones and Infowars have long been consumed with paranoia over the prospect of communist infiltration and indoctrination,” the lawsuit, filed in Travis County District Court in Austin, Tex., said. “Over the past year alone, Infowars has featured hundreds of sensationalist articles and videos focusing on the threat of communist agitation and conspiracies.”  Mr. Fontaine declined a request for an interview, but his lawyer, Mark D. Bankston, said it was obvious that Mr. Fontaine’s shirt was not to be taken seriously. The shirt, which is called “The Communist Party,” shows Marx, the 19th century economist who wrote “The Communist Manifesto,” wearing a lampshade on his head and Stalin, Lenin, Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro drinking from red plastic cups.  “We believe that Mr. Fontaine was targeted due to the T-shirt he was wearing, and that Infowars intentionally disregarded fundamental newsroom ethics due to its desire to politicize the tragedy,” Mr. Bankston said. Infowars did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. On Monday, the website appended an editors’ note atop the Feb. 14 story that said it had previously “showed a photograph of a young man that we had received and stated incorrectly that it was an alleged photo of the suspected shooter.” It continued, “We regret that this error occurred.” What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     An archive of the Infowars story by the Wayback Machine shows that Mr. Fontaine’s photo was online for at least five hours. In the editors’ note, Infowars said Mr. Fontaine later asked for the photo to be removed, but by that time, it had already been taken down. But the short time it did appear on the site caused lasting damage, according to the lawsuit. Mr. Fontaine continues to be harassed and receive threats, the lawsuit said, and is seeking more than $1 million in damages. Led by Mr. Jones, who has repeatedly asserted that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was “completely fake” and that the Sept. 11 terror attacks were an “inside job,” Infowars attracts millions of visitors every month with stories often based on unsupported claims and conspiracy theories. With little evidence, Infowars and Mr. Jones, the host of a popular radio show, have propagated wild allegations that they have ended up having to retract. In March 2017, Mr. Jones apologized for spreading the hoax known as Pizzagate, which claimed that top Democratic officials operated a satanic child pornography ring in the basement of Comet Ping Pong, a Washington pizza restaurant. His apology came three months after a man motivated by the conspiracy theory fired a rifle inside the restaurant. In May 2017, Mr. Jones retracted several stories and issued an apology to Chobani Yogurt in order to resolve a lawsuit filed by the company for asserting that its Idaho factory, which employs refugees, was connected to a 2016 sexual assault of a child.  The shooting at Stoneman Douglas High, along with the student survivors who have since led impassioned rallies for restrictions on guns, quickly attracted the attention of far-right provocateurs. A month after the shooting, YouTube cracked down on some fringe groups whose conspiracy-theory videos had climbed the site’s “trending” list. YouTube issued a warning against Infowars, which had published a video that falsely claimed that a Stoneman Douglas student, David Hogg, was a “crisis actor.” In the lawsuit, Mr. Bankston said that the Infowars story about the school gunman fell in line with the site’s overall strategy. “These sorts of reckless lies are what caused a disturbed individual to enter a pizzeria and begin firing,” he said. “Alex Jones is no longer a gimmick or sideshow. His audience rivals that of major cable networks, yet he refuses to exercise the most basic journalistic integrity,” Mr. Bankston added on Tuesday. “What happened to Mr. Fontaine is the predictable result of the reckless practices Mr. Jones has fostered at Infowars.”  ",2018-04-03,0.6921198,Tuesday
Sports,19,"Jesus Luzardo was running late for a pitching session at Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., when the Oakland A’s prospect received an alarming text: A shooting was underway. 
                On Baseball             By                     
                                    TYLER KEPNER
                            
                MARCH 21, 2018 MESA, Ariz. — Gil Patterson got the call in the Oakland Athletics’ bullpen on Feb. 14, while supervising a pitcher’s practice session. General Manager David Forst was on the line. Forst asked if Patterson, the minor league pitching coordinator, had spoken yet to Jesus Luzardo, one of the team’s top prospects, who would soon report to camp. There had been a shooting in Parkland, Fla., at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Luzardo’s alma mater and where he throws in the winter. “Give him a call now,” Forst told Patterson. “Don’t wait.” Luzardo was unharmed; he wasn’t there. He had been running late, finishing up on the golf course with a friend when the Douglas baseball coach texted him a warning to stay away from campus because an active shooter was on the grounds. Luzardo was planning to throw to hitters on the high school baseball team that day and had hoped to arrive just after classes ended. The rampage claimed 17 lives. “I went home, but it was a mess. Just chaos all around Parkland,” Luzardo said last week, in an interview at the Athletics’ minor league complex. “I started texting some of my buddies on the baseball team. One of my real good friends, his little brother is a guy I grew up with, because he was a catcher. I texted him right away; he told me he was locked in a room, hearing gunshots. Another buddy of mine — basically like my brother — his little sister hadn’t answered him in a while, so everyone was on edge.  “Thankfully, most of my good friends, they got responses from their family and their friends. But then again, there were other people I know that weren’t that lucky.” When Patterson reached Luzardo, he told him he would understand if he needed more time before reporting to camp. Luzardo made it on time, anyway, but arrived in Mesa with a plan to help. Luzardo knew three of the victims, including the school’s athletic director, Chris Hixon. He started a YouCaring Page where almost $10,000 has been donated to support the college scholarship at Douglas that Hixon’s family is establishing in his name.  “He was always there. Just a great guy,” Luzardo said. “A lot of people say this, but he would legit give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. He’d help you out. He was strict on certain people when he needed to be but in a good way. He’s one of those people that really cared for the kids. “He always helped me out when I needed it and put me on the right path.” Luzardo said he did not know the alleged gunman, Nikolas Cruz, and did not think he ever had a class with him, but he did recognize his face. Luzardo, 20, graduated from Douglas in 2016, when the Washington Nationals drafted him in the third round. He and a teammate – third baseman Colton Welker, a fourth-round pick by Colorado – were just the second and third players selected from the school since 2007, when the Boston Red Sox took Anthony Rizzo, now the star first baseman for the Chicago Cubs, in the sixth round. (The Marlins took an infielder, Adam Kam, in the 50th round in 2009.) Rizzo had already reported to spring training when the attack occurred, but he flew home to speak at a vigil. “It’s a great school,” Rizzo said. “It’s a good community with good people. In any place, anywhere, you’re going to have a couple of kids that are breaking the rules or not doing what they’re supposed to do. But for the most part, it’s a very disciplined, well-run school.” Rizzo said he was heartened by the continued activism of Douglas students. “I’m very proud of that,” he said. “It’s not on the front page anymore and the kids are still going and making a difference.” Luzardo, who admires but has not met Rizzo, said he tries to stay out of politics and declined to give an opinion on what could be done about school shootings. But gun violence has shaken him before.      “Almost all of my family is from Venezuela,” said Luzardo, who was born in Peru because his father worked there but left for Miami as a toddler. “You hear about the violence and the guns and everything being such a problem over there. But you never expect it to hit home, especially since Parkland was rated the safest place in Florida right before that happened. Growing up, I would have never thought of hearing gunshots in Parkland.” Hixon, who was 49, served in the United States Navy for 27 years. He was prepared for the unthinkable.  “He just went right in,” Greg Richardson, the school athletic trainer, told CBS Miami. “He was watching the cameras and just jumped in his golf cart and went right to the scene.” Luzardo had heard about that, too. “It sounds like him, honestly,” he said. The Douglas baseball team won the Class 9A state championship in Luzardo’s senior year, though he hurt his elbow in the fourth inning of his fifth start. He felt a pop in his arm, and then a burning sensation in the dugout between innings. He tried to warm up but could not throw. Luzardo needed Tommy John surgery, ending his high school career. Considered a first-round talent, he knew he would fall in the draft. While Luzardo’s classmates played basketball in gym one day, Hixon — a substitute teacher for the class – sat with Luzardo and offered encouragement. “He told me, ‘This isn’t the end of the world. You’re a great athlete.’ All that stuff,” Luzardo said. “I was down after I got hurt, and he helped me get out from the dumps.” The Nationals looked past the injury and gave Luzardo a $1.4 million bonus, well above his slotted value as the 94th overall pick, to persuade him to turn down a scholarship to the University of Miami. Last July they traded Luzardo to Oakland in a deal for the veteran relievers Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson. Luzardo thrived in a carefully controlled debut season, pitching 12 minor league games with a 1.66 earned run average, logging 43 1/3 innings with 48 strikeouts. He is ranked among the top 100 prospects by MLB.com (No. 60) and Baseball Prospectus (No. 88), with a fastball between 94 and 99 miles an hour, and a quality changeup and breaking ball. Patterson said Luzardo reminds him of Johan Santana, the former Minnesota Twins and Mets left-hander. Luzardo said Santana was his favorite pitcher growing up. “It’s like he’s already pitched seven years in the big leagues,” Patterson said. “He is so mature and poised for his age.” Luzardo has pitched in one major league game this spring, working a scoreless inning, and spends his days in relative obscurity, down the street from the main A’s stadium with the other minor leaguers. He is far from home, and while he loves Parkland, he is happy to be here. Baseball is a sanctuary.  “When I came out here, I just kind of needed to get away a little bit,” Luzardo said. “Sometimes, when you’ve got a lot in your head, when you pitch, it kind of all goes away. I just lock in, and it releases everything.”  See More » ",2018-03-21,0.6719068,Wednesday
National,20," By JULIE TURKEWITZ, PATRICIA MAZZEI and AUDRA D. S. BURCHFEB. 15, 2018 Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., hid in closets as a gunman fired a semiautomatic weapon into their classrooms. Seventeen people were killed. For the latest news in the wake of the Florida school shooting, read Thursday’s coverage. PARKLAND, Fla. — The suspect in one of the deadliest school shootings in modern American history confessed to the police that he “began shooting students that he saw in the hallways and on school grounds,” according to a police arrest report released Thursday. The suspect, Nikolas Cruz, 19, carried a black duffel bag and backpack, where he hid loaded magazines, the report said. He arrived at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in an Uber at 2:19 p.m. on Wednesday and pulled out a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle, according to details described by the authorities at a news conference on Thursday. Mr. Cruz also shot people inside five classrooms on the first and second floors of the freshman building. He eventually discarded the rifle, a vest and ammunition in a stairwell, blended in with fleeing students and got away, the authorities said. After leaving the school, Mr. Cruz walked to a Walmart, and bought a drink at a Subway. He also stopped at a McDonald’s. He was arrested by the police without incident as he walked down a residential street at 3:41 p.m. “He looked like a typical high school student, and for a quick moment I thought, could this be the person who I need to stop?” said Officer Michael Leonard. Here are the takeaways: • Mr. Cruz faces 17 counts of premeditated murder — one for each of the people he is accused of killing on Wednesday in a shooting that was captured on cellphone video by terrified students. He is being held without bond at the main Broward County jail, where he has been placed on suicide watch, according to Gordon Weekes, the county’s chief assistant public defender. • The AR-15 rifle used in the attack was purchased legally, at Sunrise Tactical Supply in Florida, according to a federal law enforcement official. The arrest report said Mr. Cruz purchased it in February 2017. “No laws were violated in the procurement of this weapon,” said Peter J. Forcelli, the special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Miami. • The F.B.I. said on Thursday it received information last year about a comment made on a YouTube channel which has been attributed to the gunman, but was unable to identify the person. • In Florida, an AR-15 is easier to buy than a handgun. Read more on how the AR-15 became one of the weapons of choice for mass killers, and the research that tries to explain the high rate of mass shootings in the United States. • With this shooting, three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern United States history have come in the last five months. Here is a graphic that records the grim toll of school shootings across the nation. • A huge crowd gathered at Pine Trails Park in Parkland for an emotional vigil to commemorate the victims, 14 of whom were students. Read more about the victims here. The football team gathered separately nearby, forming a circle and locking hands before praying for a coach and an athletic director who were killed. Nikolas Cruz, shown with a public defender, was ordered to be held in jail without bond. • Sign up for the Morning Briefing for news and a daily look at what you need to know to begin your day. Among them was a popular football coach and a geography teacher credited with saving a boy’s life when he stood in front of a classroom door. The coach, Aaron Feis, was seen as someone who looked out for students who got in trouble, those who were struggling, those without fathers at home. “He’d go out of his way to help anybody,” said Mr. Feis’s grandfather, Raymond. Read more about the victims here. Shackled around his hands, feet and waist, Mr. Cruz was asked if he understood the circumstances. “Yes, ma’am,” he whispered. “He’s sad. He’s mournful,” his public defender, Melisa McNeill, said afterward. “He is fully aware of what is going on, and he’s just a broken human being.” Mr. Weekes, the chief assistant public defender, said the lawyers were still trying to piece together the details of Mr. Cruz’s life. Mr. Cruz has a “significant” history of mental illness, according to Mr. Weekes, and is possibly autistic or has a learning disability. But Mr. Weekes was not yet ready to say whether he would pursue a mental health defense. Howard Finkelstein, the chief public defender in Broward County, said the case will present a difficult question: Should society execute mentally ill people? “There’s no question of whether he will be convicted of capital murder 17 times,” he said. “When we let one of our children fall off grid, when they are screaming for help in every way, do we have the right to kill them when we could have stopped it?” The family that took him in, the Sneads, had seen signs of depression in Mr. Cruz, but nothing indicated that he was capable of this kind of violence, Jim Lewis, the family’s attorney, said. The family had allowed Mr. Cruz to bring his gun with him to their house, insisting that he keep it in a lockbox. Mr. Lewis had encouraged Mr. Cruz to attend adult education courses, work toward his G.E.D., and take a job at a local Dollar Tree store, he said in a brief interview. The Sneads’ son, a junior, knew Mr. Cruz from Stoneman Douglas High. On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz and the Sneads’ son were texting until 2:18 p.m., Mr. Lewis said — about five minutes before the first 911 calls about the shooting. “But there was nothing crazy in the texts,” Mr. Lewis said. Here is our profile on Mr. Cruz. Gino Santorio, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Broward Health, said the hospital where Mr. Cruz was taken, Broward Health North, enacted safety protocols when he arrived on Wednesday. The staff treated the suspect “like every patient they treat,” Mr. Santorio said. “We were able to seclude the patient, treat and get them out without any issues,” he added. Broward Health North received nine patients, including the suspect, according to Kelly Keys, manager of emergency preparedness for the health system. Two patients died, three remain at the hospital, and three have gone home. Just hours after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., students turned to social media to advocate for more gun control. Students and parents in Parkland, an affluent suburb in Florida’s most intensely Democratic county, said a focus from policymakers on treating mental illness was not enough. Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter Alyssa, 14, was killed, made an emotional plea for action. “President Trump, we need action, we need change,” she said, the urgency rising in her voice. “Get these guns out of the hands of these young kids and get these guns off the streets.”      “If we’re constantly having our children worried about getting shot at, what are we telling our future?” said David Hogg, 17, a senior, who said two of his 14-year-old sister’s friends were killed. “And that’s what these people are killing, our future.” Superintendent Runcie did not mince words: “Now is the time for the country to have a real conversation on sensible gun controls in this country,” he said. Democrats in Congress welcomed a gun control debate. “At some point, we’ve got to say enough is enough,” Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said on the Senate floor. But in an interview on WIBC radio on Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that public policymakers “shouldn’t just knee-jerk before we even have all the facts and the data.” He added, “We need to think less about taking sides and fighting each other politically, and just pulling together.” In an address to the nation, President Trump announced he would visit Parkland and work with the nation’s governors “to help secure our schools, and tackle the difficult issue of mental health.” But he made no mention of guns. 
                Since 26 people were killed in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, a nonprofit that tracks school shootings has recorded five a month, on average.             Ben Bennight, a bail bondsman in Mississippi, said in an interview that he reported a suspicious comment left on his YouTube channel last fall by a user named “nikolas cruz.” “I’m going to be a professional school shooter,” the Sept. 24 comment said. Mr. Bennight took a screenshot of the comment and flagged it to YouTube, which removed the post. Mr. Bennight said he then left a voice mail message at his local F.B.I. field office alerting it to the comment. Mr. Bennight, 36, said that when he originally reported the comments to the F.B.I., a pair of agents interviewed him the next morning. Mr. Bennight said two F.B.I. agents visited him a few hours after the shooting on Wednesday, spending about 15 to 20 minutes with him. The agents told him they thought the person who posted on his channel might be connected to the Florida shooting because they had the same name. At a candlelight vigil Thursday night for the 17 people killed in a Florida school shooting, attendees chanted, “No more guns.” The F.B.I. on Thursday released a statement that said it received information about a comment made on a YouTube channel in September 2017. “No other information was included in the comment which would indicate a particular time, location, or the true identity of the person who posted the comment,” the statement said. The F.B.I. said it conducted database reviews and other checks, but was unable to further identify the person who posted the comment. On Thursday, Jordan Jereb, a leader of a white supremacist group based in North Florida, told The Associated Press that Mr. Cruz had joined the group, but later Mr. Jereb said that he did not know whether that was true. Sheriff Israel said he could not confirm any ties Mr. Cruz might have had to white nationalists. Two Instagram accounts that classmates said belonged to Mr. Cruz were filled with images of weaponry, as well as the hats and bandannas he liked to wear to school. Among more innocuous pictures of animals, including a dog and a gecko, was a picture of a slaughtered toad. In response to a comment on that image, Mr. Cruz wrote that toads tended to run away when they saw him, because “I killed a lot of them.” Other posts on the first account, like one captioned “arsenal,” showcased collections of firearms, including what appears to be a Savage Axis bolt-action rifle, a Smith and Wesson M&P15-series rifle, and at least two shotguns. The AR-15 assault rifle, and others like it, is commonly used in mass shootings in the United States. Here's a closer look at likely reasons. It was unclear whether the profile picture for that account, a face nearly entirely covered with a “Make America Great Again” hat and large bandanna, was an image of Mr. Cruz. The profile picture for the second account also featured a face almost fully covered, this time with an Army beanie. The account included several pictures of a figure wearing several different Army hats and carrying guns and knives. It also contained a picture of a Google search for the Arabic phrase “Allahu akbar” — God is great. Instagram did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Moises Lobaton, a senior, was in psychology class when gunfire boomed. The students scurried to try to hide as far away from the door as possible. “There wasn’t enough space behind the desk, so not all of the kids could fit,” he said. Shots shattered a glass window on the door, injuring at least three of his classmates, including a girl who “wasn’t moving at all.” “She was next to a pool of blood, but I couldn’t tell if it was hers or the guy next to hers,” he said. The boy had been shot in the arm and was bleeding profusely. His classmates wrapped the arm in cloth. Another boy called 911. “The shots were something I’ll never forget. It sounded like bombs going off, one at a time,” he said. “If I was one or two feet to the right, I would have died.” 
                A gunman armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifle and “countless magazines” killed at least 17 people at his former high school on Wednesday.             Cole Carlberg, 16, turned himself in, and the police picked up Joshua Schechter, 16, after receiving a 911 call at about 9 a.m. on Thursday. Both were charged with making terroristic threats, aggravated harassment and criminal possession of a weapon, a New York police sergeant, Brendan Ryan, said. On Wednesday, the teenagers had posted on Snapchat that they had planned to shoot up Brooklyn Prospect Charter School on Fort Hamilton Parkway, Sergeant Ryan said, adding that the school contacted parents about the threat. One of the teenagers had an “air pistol rifle” that Sergeant Ryan described as a pellet or BB gun, but said it was unclear who owned it. “That’s still under investigation,” he said. Mr. Carlberg and Mr. Schechter remained in custody on Thursday night, Sergeant Ryan said. Reporting was contributed by Audra D.S.

None,21," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 18, 2018, 4:07 P.M. E.D.T. NEW YORK —  Two students who survived the deadly mass shooting this year at a Florida high school have a book deal. Siblings David and Lauren Hogg are working on ""#NEVERAGAIN: A New Generation Draws the Line."" Random House announced Wednesday that the book would come out June 5 and that the Hoggs were donating their proceeds to charity and community organizations. The Hoggs and other students at the Parkland, Florida, school have become leading gun control advocates since the Feb. 14 tragedy that left 17 people dead. Random House is calling the book ""a moving portrait"" of a new political movement. The publisher will make a donation to Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit organization founded in 2014.

Opinion,22," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Gaby Pacheco It was Jan. 1, 2010, the beginning of a new decade. Instead of sleeping in after what should have been a fun night bringing in the new year, my friends and I were up early putting on matching Nike sneakers to start walking the 1,500 miles from Miami to Washington. This is what set off the “Dreamer” movement, which fights for the rights of immigrant youth and their families. What began with me and my friends Carlos, Juan and Felipe walking turned into a national campaign joined by tens of thousands of young people. I’ve been thinking of those early days a lot, ever since the teenage survivors of last month’s deadly school shooting started demanding stricter gun controls and rallying other young people to their cause. That shooting happened in Parkland, Fla., just an hour from where our Dreamer march began. And next weekend, those teenagers will be joined by tens of thousands of others as they, too, march on Washington. Young people have an incredible ability to drive change. But it’s not easy. I offer my own experience in case it provides any comfort or guidance. My activism was born out of necessity and rage. I learned I was undocumented when I was in the eighth grade. My senior year, my college counselor told me that I could not go to college. She advised hiding my immigration status and staying quiet. I quickly realized that adults live a more cautious, fearful life than young people, and their conservative views on how to tackle issues couldn’t help me. It was up to me to find a way for myself and others like me to go to college. One of the first things I learned, when my friends and I started to get some attention, is how quickly politicians try to co-opt youth movements for their own agendas. Both Republicans and Democrats claimed to care about immigrants, but both parties continued to deport people and failed to pass immigration reform. The same thing is already happening to the Parkland kids. I saw politicians turn a recent town hall for the parents, teachers and students into a platform to debate not a solution to gun violence, but which party was better. Young activists must learn to trust their instincts and not let these debates distract them from their goals. At the same time, they have to trust the wisdom and experience of those who preceded them. Before embarking on our march, I had the opportunity to meet with the Rev. James Lawson, who helped coordinate the 1963 March on Washington. He served as one of the advisers for our walk. The struggle of black people in America, not just during the civil rights movement but today, is one we knew we had to understand and emulate. We called our walk the Trail of Dreams as a tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., as well as a memorial to the Native Americans who died in the Trail of Tears. We wanted to remind people how many atrocities have been carried out in this county in the name of “law and order.” The young activists of today are more adept with social media than we were. But I would encourage them to get out into the streets to talk to people. Our march took four months, and we spent time in the communities we visited. We rested on Mondays because weekends were when people were most likely to be free to walk with us. One challenge in every social justice movement is making sure it’s not dominated by a single voice. At the beginning, I was surprised to be criticized by fellow activists because I was not a Mexican immigrant. I did not have to walk across the border; my family came to this country from Ecuador on an airplane, with a tourist visa. My parents bought an apartment before we arrived. Because I was more privileged than many others, I tried to put them front and center when reporters came to talk to us. Learning to give up your seat so others can have a voice helps legitimize and strengthen your movement. This is very important for the Parkland teenagers, many of whom are white and well off — the kind of kids the news media typically pays the most attention to. They have met with students from Chicago, where young people have long been speaking out about gun violence without much national attention. But they can and ought to do more. At the same time, as a woman, I also knew I had to speak out, because my voice was often ignored. One day, two male reporters asked me, “Where are the students who are walking?” I smiled and said, “I am one of them, how can I help you?” They looked at me and said, “No, the people who are walking, where are the boys?” This kept on happening. Maybe they didn’t think a woman could walk 18 miles a day, or maybe they thought that because I was overweight, I couldn’t possibly do this. After a CNN interview during which I had to force myself into the conversation, I shared what I had been experiencing with my fellow walkers. They decided that from then on, I would be the first person to speak at events. Perhaps the hardest thing about being part of a youth movement is transitioning out of it. I am now 33. It’s been 17 years since the introduction of the Dream Act, and still it has not passed. Part of me feels like I have failed. I am still involved, but not at the forefront of the fight. I realized I could no longer go days without sleep, working on strategy and giving interviews. I needed a succession plan. And I wanted to help mentor other smart and motivated young people. Perhaps the Parkland students will be luckier than we were, and will see stricter gun control enacted before they hit their 30s. But if not, they will have to pass on the baton. This is important not just for the continuity of a movement but also for the sanity of the individuals within it. Finally, people are going to attack any activist in the spotlight. Being vocal in the age of social media is hard. My advice to the youth activists of today is: Don’t read the comments. And if you do, don’t take what they say personally. While it is worth your time to listen respectfully to those who think differently from you, when someone is insulting you, it’s best to ignore them. I will always be an advocate, but it will take people who are brave, energetic — and young — to keep the fire burning. Thankfully, the resilience and strength of the Parkland students and the next generation of Dreamers fill me with hope.

But to Ms. Schneid, a survivor of the school shooting that killed 17 people last month in Parkland, Fla., the march is just the beginning — a moment of political awakening, she hopes, that will put the nation on notice that young people plan to be a greater, more organized force than teenagers and college students in the past. “It’s going to look like millions and millions of people,” said Ms. Schneid, 16, who is the editor of the newspaper at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. “And it’s going to look scary to politicians.” With more than 800 student-led demonstrations planned in the United States and internationally, the organizers of the March for Our Lives are aiming for a generational show of strength by a diverse movement united in a conviction that adults have failed them. Still, for all their fierce energy, these liberal-leaning activists have yet to be tested in the arena of electoral politics. They face a political system that is historically resistant to major change, and a Republican president and Congress with a strong base of support among much older voters, many of whom have more conservative views on guns. A major moment will come in the 2018 midterm elections: Some students will be eligible to vote in November, and have vowed to make gun laws a central issue. Many more hope to organize networks and lay groundwork to vent their frustration — about pervasive school violence, and an unjust political system they view as enabling it — in the next vote for president in 2020. _________ More? • See all the films in this series. • Read our list of practical teaching ideas, along with responses from students and teachers, for how you can use these documentaries in the classroom. • Our next Film Club will take place on Thursday, April 19.

None,24," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 10, 2018, 1:43 P.M. E.D.T. PARKLAND, Fla. —  New Jersey, Colorado, Los Angeles, Raleigh-Durham — the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students reel off their upcoming travel schedule at a dizzying pace. This is their new life, traveling the country advocating for gun control, all while trying to keep up with their studies about two months after 17 people were killed in a shooting at their school. ""I've been invited to synagogues and churches and colleges and high school walkouts, and it's so much, and I wish I could go to everything,"" said junior Jaclyn Corin, who is part of the core group of ""Never Again MSD."" ''It's the best problem in the world where everybody wants to help us and wants to include us."" Almost overnight, Corin became one of the leaders in a huge organization that is looking to build on a grassroots movement that spurred hundreds of thousands around the globe to rally for gun reform on March 24. The students' mantra is ""vote them out"" — a message that applies to any lawmaker who accepts support from the National Rifle Association or declines to talk with them about gun rights. They're inviting lawmakers to town halls, with more than 200 scheduled around the country. They are also trying to register as many teenagers as they can before November's midterm elections. At a town hall near Parkland last week, supporters passed out red bumper stickers that called for a ban on assault rifles. Dozens of people were still waiting at microphones to ask questions when the event ended after two hours. Florida Congressman Ted Deutch said another town hall would be held later.  Near the entrance, a sign at a voter registration table let students know they can pre-register to vote as early as age 16.  ""Nothing we did on March 24 is going to mean anything if no one goes out to vote in November because that, at the end of the day, that's where our voices are going to be heard,"" said Alex Wind, a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Classmate David Hogg, who has received personal attacks from conservatives falsely accusing him of being a crisis actor, is crisscrossing the country visiting Iowa, Tennessee and possibly Missouri. ""I'm going to different congressional districts, specifically ones where there is a politician, either Democrat or a Republican, that is supported by the NRA ... I'm also going to a lot of these places where the politicians have called us out, like Steve King,"" he said, referring to the Iowa congressman who has repeatedly criticized the students on social media. King lambasted student Emma Gonzalez for wearing a Cuban flag patch at the Washington march last month. Some of the students said they're struggling to find balance as grassroots leaders and students with homework, Advanced Placement exams and college applications. They've outgrown an office donated by a Stoneman Douglas parent and are moving to a new, secret location after their past address was leaked to the press. Most of their engagements are now handled by a professional booking agent and a public relations firm.      Many have missed classes. Corin, whose course load includes several Advanced Placement classes, missed an entire week of school before spring break. ""I'm kind of overwhelmed because I've always been one to value my academics and now school is kind of becoming on a level playing field with everything else,"" she said. Several students will head to New York at the end of the month to be honored at a Time magazine event after they were on the cover last month. Chris Grady and a few others will speak at an event in Colorado on the anniversary of the Columbine school shooting. On top of their travels, Cameron Kasky is juggling the school play and Gonzalez is trying to focus on school work.  The frantic pace can be exhausting, the students said. Deutsch was so booked up last week, he asked a reporter to schedule an interview on Easter Sunday. The students feel pressured that ""If we don't stay in the media, the media is going to go away,"" Wind said. But they're also getting help from organizations such as Everytown for Gun Safety and Women's March, which provides training and resources. Both groups have chapters in colleges and high schools across the country. ""I feel like now 'til midterms is what we're calling our Phase Two, but there's going to be a Phase Three and a Phase Four and a Phase Five,"" Corin said. ""As much as I want assault rifles to be banned, that probably won't be a reality for another four or six or eight years — or ever."" The students are keenly aware of the dismal youth turnout in general elections, and that it's practically non-existent in midterms. ""The youth have been shot down for far too long, both literally and metaphorically,"" senior Ryan Deitsch said, citing young voter turnout of less than one in five. ""If we can get it to three out of five, we could control and shift every major election to come.""  ",2018-04-10,0.6317176,Tuesday
None,25," By REUTERSAPRIL 10, 2018, 12:13 P.M. E.D.T. NEW YORK —  Since the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida less than two months ago, at least 10 U.S. states have proposed spending significantly more to bolster school safety. Here is a look at some of the states with funding plans aimed at thwarting another mass shooting of minors. Legislation would pay for everything from retrofitting schools with bulletproof glass and panic buttons to adding and training armed resource officers. * Alabama – Lets schools use education technology fund to pay for safety measures. An estimated $58 million will be used for school safety in the current fiscal year. * Arkansas – Creates a school study commission and funds $300,000 for school resource officer training.  * Florida – Passed $400 million to retrofit schools with bulletproof glass and other armoring fixtures, add resource officers, expand mental health services and develop a program to arm some teachers.  * Indiana – A bill would add $5 million for school safety funding on top of the current $10 million, to be considered again in a May special session after it did not come up for a vote in the session that ended in March. * Maine – Lawmakers are considering issuing $20 million of bonds to be used to secure schools. * Maryland - Governor Larry Hogan proposed spending $125 million to enhance schools for safety, plus $50 million annually for school resource officers, to come from casino revenues.      * Minnesota – Governor Mark Dayton proposed spending $20.9 million to enhance school safety and grants for mental health services. * New Jersey – Lawmakers are considering issuing $250 million in debt for school safety. * New Mexico – Governor Susana Martinez signed legislation on March 7 to spend $40 million over four years on grants for school districts to harden infrastructure. The bill was introduced in January, before Parkland but just weeks after New Mexico's deadly school shooting in Aztec. Money to come out of the overall public school capital projects fund. * Tennessee – Governor Bill Haslam's budget amendment proposal adds $30 million to school security. * Wisconsin – Governor Scott Walker signed measure creating $100 million school safety grant program.

None,26," By REUTERSAPRIL 10, 2018, 12:10 P.M. E.D.T. NEW YORK —  Before the ink could dry on Florida Governor Rick Scott's signature last month, critics cried foul over the bill he signed into law to spend $400 million boosting security at schools across the state following February's Parkland mass shooting. School officials, local sheriffs and Democrats opposed different provisions, including one to provide $67 million to arm teachers. Educators, in particular, voiced concerns that the state will strip money from core education funding to pay for the new school resource officers and beefed up buildings. ""We are a very lean state,"" said Florida state Senator Jose Javier Rodriguez, a Democrat who voted against the bill. ""If we're spending money somewhere, we're taking it from somewhere else."" In the wake of the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida that killed 17 people, at least 10 U.S. states have introduced measures to increase funding for hardening of school buildings and campuses, add resource officers and increase mental health services, according to Reuters' tally.  Many of the proposals outlined the need for bulletproof windows, panic buttons and armored shelters to be installed in classrooms. Some legislation called for state police or sheriff's departments to provide officers to patrol public schools.  Altogether, more than 100 legislative bills to address school safety, not all of which have funding components, have been introduced in 27 states since the Feb. 14 shooting at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, according to data provided by the National Conference of State Legislatures. But states do not usually have extra money on hand or room to raise taxes. So to pay for the measures, states are mostly shifting money away from other projects, dipping into reserves     or contemplating borrowing. ""I would characterize these proposals and the bills that were passed, for example Florida and Wisconsin, as primarily shifting funding from other priorities,"" said Kathryn White, senior policy analyst at the National Association of State Budget Officers. Calls for more gun control and more safety measures have come during peak budget season for nearly all states, whose legislatures spend the spring in debates that shape the coming year's budget starting July 1. STATE BY STATE Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker called a special legislative session last month, when lawmakers agreed to create a $100 million school safety grant program. The money will come out of the state's general fund. But the spending, coupled with tax cuts and other pending legislation, will leave that fund with reserves of roughly $185 million - enough to run state government for less than four days in the event of a fiscal emergency, according to Jon Peacock, director of the think tank Wisconsin Budget Project. ""That is far less of a cushion than a fiscally responsible state should set aside,"" Peacock said. Funding the safety measures also means that some economic development programs for rural counties did not get funded and a one-time sales tax holiday was scaled back, he said.      In Maine, lawmakers are considering borrowing $20 million by issuing 10-year general obligation bonds to fund loans to school districts for security enhancements.  New Jersey lawmakers are also looking to borrow. On March 26, state senators tacked an extra $250 million for school security onto an existing bill for $500 million of bonds to expand county vocational colleges. The legislature has not yet voted on the measure. Maryland, Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and Indiana are also increasing - or trying to increase - funding for school security measures since Parkland. In Florida, the legislature passed safety spending while approving an increase of only $0.47 per pupil in funding used to cover teacher pay raises, school bus fuel and other operational expenses for education. ""We see $400-plus million in school safety, which we absolutely applaud, but you can't do that at the expense of your core education program,"" Broward County schools Superintendent Robert Runcie said shortly before Scott signed the budget. Stoneman Douglas is among the schools Runcie, who also heads the Florida Association of District School Superintendents, oversees. To be sure, some state and local governments have been adding money for school safety measures for years, particularly after 20 children and six adults were killed in a shooting in Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. Some critics, particularly Democrats, say measures that only beef up infrastructure or do not create recurring funds fall short of the mark. Dan Rossmiller, government relations director of the Wisconsin Association of School Boards, said in a memo to lawmakers in March that individual districts also need money for prevention and intervention, including education services for expelled students and anti-bullying programs, and other purposes. ""Funding for only 'hardening' school facilities, while welcome, is likely not going to be sufficient to address the full range of locally identified needs,"" he said.

Business,27," By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUMFEB. 20, 2018 The teenagers of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., who a week ago lost 17 of their classmates and school staff members in a mass shooting, have emerged as passionate advocates for reform, speaking openly of their anger in the hope of forcing a reckoning on guns. But in certain right-wing corners of the web — and, increasingly, from more mainstream voices like Rush Limbaugh and a commentator on CNN — the students are being portrayed not as grief-ridden survivors but as pawns and conspiracists intent on exploiting a tragedy to undermine the nation’s laws. In these baseless accounts, which by Tuesday had spread rapidly on social media, the students are described as “crisis actors,” who travel to the sites of shootings to instigate fury against guns. Or they are called F.B.I. plants, defending the bureau for its failure to catch the shooter. They have been portrayed as puppets being coached and manipulated by the Democratic Party, gun control activists, the so-called antifa movement and the left-wing billionaire George Soros. The theories are far-fetched. But they are finding a broad and prominent audience online. On Tuesday, the president’s son Donald J. Trump Jr. liked a pair of tweets that accused David Hogg, a 17-year-old who is among the most outspoken of the Parkland students, of criticizing the Trump administration in an effort to protect his father, whom Mr. Hogg has described as a retired F.B.I. agent.  Mr. Hogg, the high school’s student news director, has become a sensation among many liberals for his polished and compelling television interviews, in which he has called on lawmakers to enact tougher restrictions on guns. Just as quickly, Mr. Hogg attracted the disdain of right-wing provocateurs like The Gateway Pundit, a fringe website that gained prominence in 2016 for pushing conspiracies about voter fraud and Hillary Clinton.  In written posts and YouTube videos — one of which had more than 100,000 views as of Tuesday night — Gateway Pundit has argued that Mr. Hogg had been coached on what to say during his interviews. The notion that Mr. Hogg is merely protecting his father dovetails with a broader right-wing trope, that liberal forces in the F.B.I. are trying to undermine President Trump and his pro-Second Amendment supporters. Others offered more sweeping condemnations. Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind the site Infowars, suggested that the mass shooting was a “false flag” orchestrated by anti-gun groups. Mr. Limbaugh, on his radio program, said of the student activists on Monday: “Everything they’re doing is right out of the Democrat Party’s various playbooks. It has the same enemies: the N.R.A. and guns.”      By Tuesday, that argument had migrated to CNN. In an on-air appearance, Jack Kingston, a former United States representative from Georgia and a regular CNN commentator, asked, “Do we really think — and I say this sincerely — do we really think 17-year-olds on their own are going to plan a nationwide rally?” (He was quickly rebuked by the anchor Alyson Camerota.) Conspiracies, wild and raw online, are often pasteurized on their way into the mainstream. A subtler version of the theory appeared Tuesday on the website of Bill O’Reilly, the ousted Fox News host. Mr. O’Reilly stopped short of saying the students had been planted by anti-Trump forces. But, he wrote: “The national press believes it is their job to destroy the Trump administration by any means necessary. So if the media has to use kids to do that, they’ll use kids.” Some of those who have been spreading the conspiracies are facing consequences. Benjamin Kelly, an aide to a Florida state representative, Shawn Harrison, emailed a Tampa Bay Times reporter on Tuesday accusing Mr. Hogg and a classmate, Emma Gonzalez, of being actors that travel to the sites of crises. Mr. Kelly was soon fired. “I made a mistake whereas I tried to inform a reporter of information relating to his story regarding a school shooting,” Mr. Kelly tweeted. “I meant no disrespect to the students or parents of Parkland.” His boss, Mr. Harrison, said on Twitter that he was “appalled” by Mr. Kelly’s remarks. But by Tuesday evening, a new conspiracy was dominating Gateway Pundit’s home page. “Soros-Linked Organizers of ‘Women’s March’ Selected Anti-Trump Kids to Be Face of Parkland Tragedy,” read the headline. Within an hour, it had been shared on Facebook more than 150 times. A version of this article appears in print on February 21, 2018, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Dubious Theories on Shooting In Florida Find an Audience.

National,28," By JULIE TURKEWITZFEB. 21, 2018 One hundred Marjory Stoneman Douglas students traveled to Tallahassee to advocate for gun control. Survivors spoke to legislators while supporters protested across the country. TALLAHASSEE — The morning began with optimism. It did not last long. On Wednesday, students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland awoke to an overcast sky. They had slept on green cots in the Tallahassee civic center, and it had been a long, cold night. Some agreed that their blankets had smelled strangely like bacon. Many had been up past 3 a.m., researching lawmakers and editing speeches. They had runny eggs, home fries — and bacon — for breakfast. Then, a week after a shooting rampage killed 17 at their high school, the students headed for the capitol, marching together up a hill, past a statue of leaping dolphins. They had come to urge lawmakers to impose new restrictions on guns, including a ban on the sale of military-style firearms like the AR-15 used in the rampage at their school. A former student, Nikolas Cruz, has been charged in the slayings. As the students walked to the capitol, Rosio Briones, 17, was quiet. “I don’t know how to put my thoughts into words,” she said. “This still feels so surreal to me.” But another student, Olivia Feller, 16, stood with Anthony Lopez, 16, and ran through a list of state legislators: who supported what, who they might be able to sway. “We are ready,” she said. “Sleep deprived but ready.”  Outside the capitol, Senator Aaron Bean, a Republican, was rushing into the building. How did he feel about the student visit? a reporter asked.  “Angst,” he said. “I just — there is so much emotion. I’m really really sad. It’s a very sad situation. Kids shouldn’t have to worry about that. It’s already tough enough being a teenager, without worrying about things like that.” Did he plan to vote in favor of any bills that would do anything about that? “You know, I think it’s too early to say.” Why? “It’s just too early to say.” Inside, the students divided into groups of 10. Senator Lauren Book, a Democrat, had helped the students arrange meetings with lawmakers in both parties, and the groups were supposed to meet with some 70 elected officials. Group Six crammed into the elevator with two parent chaperones. They met with Representative Patricia H. Williams, a Democrat, and Senator Debbie Mayfield, a Republican. Ms. Mayfield said that changes were needed, perhaps including raising the minimum age to buy powerful weapons, but she rebuffed criticism from a student, Daniel Bishop, 16, that such a change would not actually prevent deaths. “We can’t stop crazies,” she told the group. Afterward, Amanda De La Cruz, 16, looked distraught. “I want the ban on semiautomatic weapons,” she said. “I don’t care about the crazies.” Then they headed to the House floor, where the powerful speaker of the House, Richard Corcoran, a Republican, had agreed to take their questions. Standing at the front of the chamber, he promised to unveil what he said would be the most sweeping gun reform package in the nation’s history by Thursday or Friday.  Then a 16-year-old student named Alondra Gittelson raised her hand. “I just want to know why such a destructive gun is accessible to the public — why that gun, the AR-15, that did so much damage, how is an individual in society able to acquire such a gun?” Mr. Corcoran responded that he would not be in favor of banning weapons like the one used in the attack on the students. “I think that if you look, it’s widely used in multiple different hunting scenarios,” he said. “I know people who go out and they’ll do boar hunts and they’ll use them.” He continued: “You can disagree, but what I tell my kids — and being in elected office, you have to be very, very, very careful how much authority and power you bring to government. The greatest atrocities known to mankind have been committed by governments.” “I understand your question,” he added. “And we’ll look at it, but I’ll just be honest with you: Me personally I don’t believe that’s the solution.”      Afterward, Ms. Gittelson observed that Mr. Corcoran had said exactly what her stepfather had predicted he would say. Around noon, hundreds of people converged on the capitol in support of the Stoneman Douglas students. Then, in the afternoon, the tone inside the capitol changed, as protesters flooded the building. The morning had been filled with impassioned but respectful conversation between the Stoneman Douglas students and lawmakers. But as the day wore on, college students and others packed the hallways carrying signs and boxes of petitions. On one floor, they crowded the doorway of the office of Gov. Rick Scott, shouting “Shame! Shame! Shame!” On an upper floor, they gathered outside Mr. Corcoran’s office: “Face us down! Face us down! Face us down!”  As the students pressed lawmakers in Tallahassee, cries for stricter gun control measures swelled on sidewalks and football fields around the country. Back in South Florida, students formed an enormous heart on an athletic field at Coral Springs High School and then walked to Stoneman Douglas High School, about five miles away, where more than 1,000 students gathered. “Seventeen lives are more important than gun rights,” said Christopher Lormeus, 18, who had walked from Coconut Creek High School, six miles away. Near Tampa, thousands of students left their classrooms and stood silently for 17 minutes, according to The Tampa Bay Times. The protests stretched far beyond Florida. In Montgomery County, Md., students left their high schools, walked to the Metro, and rallied in front of the Capitol, holding signs with slogans like, “Protect kids not guns.” They walked out of Simon Kenton High School in Kentucky, according to the Enquirer, chanting “never again,” and filed out of Mesa High School in Arizona, hoping to support the Parkland students. “This is our mark in history,” one student said, to whoops and cheers. But at Needville High School, about an hour outside Houston, administrators threatened any student who protested during school hours with a three-day suspension. ”Life is all about choices and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative,” Curtis Rhodes, the superintendent, said in a statement posted on Facebook. “We will discipline no matter if it is one, 50, or 500 students involved.” Jess Bidgood contributed reporting from Boston and Neil Reisner from Parkland, Fla.

Express,29," By MATT STEVENSMARCH 18, 2018 A Republican candidate for the Maine State House who disparaged two teenage survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., dropped out of the race after drawing heavy criticism and challengers from both political parties. The candidate, Leslie Gibson, had been running to represent District 57 in central Maine unopposed, according to The Sun Journal, which first reported the comments he made on Twitter. Mr. Gibson called one Florida student, Emma González, a “skinhead lesbian,” and another, David Hogg, a “moron” and a “baldfaced liar.” Some state lawmakers, including at least two Republicans, were quick to condemn Mr. Gibson after his comments surfaced. Mr. Hogg issued a call on Twitter for someone to run against Mr. Gibson. By Thursday, two challengers who had been dismayed by the remarks were scrambling to complete the paperwork needed to run for the seat before the filing deadline that night. By Friday, at least one Democrat, Eryn Gilchrist, and one Republican, Thomas H. Martin Jr., had entered the race and Mr. Gibson had withdrawn.  Mr. Gibson could not be reached on Saturday and appeared to have deleted the personal Twitter account on which he made the remarks. But screenshots confirmed that a person with a Twitter handle bearing his name posted the disparaging tweets. Other screenshots of tweets from a locked account that appear to have been for Mr. Gibson’s campaign contained an apology.  In the apologetic tweets, some of which were quoted by The Sun Journal, Mr. Gibson acknowledged that his responses were “harsh and uncivil” and said it was “inappropriate to single out” the students. Mr. Martin, who served as a state senator in another district in 2011 and 2012 before losing a re-election bid, said he had considered running for office again but had not planned to do it so soon because he and his wife had just moved to the area and had adopted a baby boy. Still, he said that after Mr. Gibson’s comments, he got calls from friends urging him to run and decided that he “couldn’t sit idle and let our state be reflected so negatively.” The comments “gave the state a black eye,” Mr. Martin said. “They weren’t the true feelings of the state or the Republican Party — or any party — I have to believe,” he said, adding that he planned to contact the Parkland students and commend their courage.      A spokesman for the Maine Republican Party did not return an email requesting comment on Saturday. In a statement from the Maine Democratic Party, Ms. Gilchrist said she had not considered running for office before she read Mr. Gibson’s comments. After she did, she said, she thought constituents in the district “deserved a representative who will respect people and try to work through their differences to make our lives better.” In the wake of the shooting last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which killed 17 people, Ms. González, 18, and Mr. Hogg, 17, emerged as two of the most forceful student activists agitating for gun control. Mr. Hogg’s early remark that “we’re children” while politicians “are the adults” won him praise. Ms. González’s speech soon after made the phrase “We call B.S.” a rallying cry among young people. Since then, the Parkland students’ ability to leverage social media to command the narrative and keep gun control in the news has been widely recognized. Ms. González did not return a phone message on Saturday night and did not appear to have responded to Mr. Gibson on Twitter directly. She did share a tweet from one of her fellow students who said Mr. Gibson’s decision to drop out of the race was “what he deserves.” 
            It’s what he deserves ☕️ https://t.co/NvXx6fKjYV         Mr. Hogg said his mother had seen a story about what Mr. Gibson had called Ms. González and he had quickly sent the tweet asking someone to challenge Mr. Gibson. “If you’re the type of person who calls children who are a witness to murder a skinhead lesbian and baldfaced liar, that kind of speaks for itself,” he said on Saturday. “It’s disgusting, but honestly, I’m a super petty person, and we all cheered when he said that he dropped out.”  “We need good people in office — people who are actually human and have an ounce of empathy,” he continued. “It’s hilarious because its ridiculous. They’re only proving our point that there are so many bad politicians out there. We almost let somebody that would say something like that win and run unopposed.” A version of this article appears in print on March 20, 2018, on Page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Candidate Quits Maine Race Over Tweets.

National,30," Supported by By Audra D. S. Burch, Nick Madigan, Richard Fausset and Julie Turkewitz CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. — Scott J. Beigel, a geography teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, shepherded his students into the safety of a classroom Wednesday afternoon as a gunman roamed the halls, shooting, killing. Mr. Beigel, 35, was fatally shot before he could lock the classroom door. Four days later, hundreds of people filled a contemporary synagogue in Boca Raton to capacity, remembering Mr. Beigel not only for his final act of selflessness, but for an entire life in service of others. “Scott’s life was not that moment; Scott’s heroism was not that incident,” said his father, Michael Schulman. “Scott’s heroism was his entire life.” On the first Sunday after a local high school lost 17 of its own, mourners said farewell at funerals, a call for action grew louder and a pastor implored his congregation not to lose faith. “Our world is broken, but Jesus is not,” Pastor Eddie Bevill of the Parkridge Church told the congregation, in reaction to the statements some students have made about the futility of prayer as a response to gun violence. “We pray that in the midst of the pain we are experiencing, that we can know you, Jesus.” Pastor Bevill also asked his flock to pray for the suspect in the shooting, Nikolas Cruz, although he did not mention Mr. Cruz’s name or ask that he be forgiven. At the high school, about a mile away from the church, a group of grief-stricken teenage survivors vowed to change the laws that allowed Mr. Cruz to get hold of an assault weapon that the authorities say he used to slaughter his former classmates. In a movement that has been building since the massacre last week, student organizers said on Sunday that they would mount a demonstration next month in Washington called March For Our Lives. Their mission is to pivot America’s long-running gun control debate — which tends to flare up with each mass shooting and then dissipate — toward meaningful action. “We want this to stop. We need this to stop. We are protecting guns more than people,” said Emma González, 18, one of five core organizers, whose impassioned speech at a rally in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday drew national attention. “We are not trying to take people’s guns away; we are trying to make sure we have gun safety.” Ms. González, a senior at the school, said the group was inviting elected officials “from any side of the political spectrum” to join the movement. But she said: “We don’t want anybody who is funded by the N.R.A. We want people who are going to be on the right side of history.” The organizers hope the march, scheduled for March 24, will attract students from across the country, and they say more protests are planned. “Our hearts are heavy, we are overburdened, and we are incapable of holding the weight of grief that is upon us, but that is even more true of the families of the deceased,” Pastor Bevill said. He then read aloud the names of the dead, as congregants wiped tears and held their arms aloft. In the afternoon, hundreds of family and friends packed a hotel ballroom to honor the memory of Jaime Guttenberg, 14. Mourners heard from cousins, a favorite teacher and her parents, each offering glowing stories that were painful to hear. Jaime loved to dance. She loved the color orange. She loved her two dogs, Charlie and Cooper. Her favorite song was “Rewrite the Stars,” and on the weekends, she volunteered to help people with special needs. Fred Guttenberg talked about watching the television show “iCarly” together. He said she was a fighter whose energy could fill a room. Mr. Guttenberg’s eulogy ended in anger and a standing ovation. He vowed to fight gun violence, and admonished President Trump for a Saturday night Twitter post that accused the F.B.I. of missing “signals” of Wednesday’s deadly rampage because of what the president characterized as the agency’s preoccupation with the Russian investigation. Mr. Beigel, one of three faculty members killed in the attack, had only worked for the school for a few months, but Denise Reed, an assistant principal, said she knew Mr. Beigel was a perfect match for the school “in definitely less than two or three minutes” after he began his interview for the job in the spring of 2017. Mr. Schulman said that Mr. Beigel would not have believed that so many people would turn out to celebrate his life. “Eh, they just came for the food,” Mr. Schulman imagined Mr. Beigel saying. The funeral for another student, Meadow Pollack, 18, was held on Friday. Her relatives, classmates, Governor Rick Scott of Florida and many others were crowded in every corner of the Congregation Kol Tikvah synagogue, about a mile from the school. Tears slipped from behind dark sunglasses as Rabbi Bradd Boxman recalled a girl who shone “like a star.” “I’m not here to explain any of this,” he said. “I can’t tell you why Meadow died the way that she did.” Ms. Pollack’s boyfriend, Brandon Schoengrund, spoke about his “princess,” his shoulders slumped in pain. And her father, Andrew Pollack, stood before the crowd and addressed the gunman. “You. Killed. My. Kid.” he said, one word at a time, his voice booming through the synagogue in grief and rage. “My kid is dead. It goes through my head all day. And night. I keep hearing it over and over.” “How does this happen to my beautiful, smart, loving daughter?” he said. “She is everything. If we could learn one thing from this tragedy, it’s that our everythings are not safe when we send them to school.” The room heaved with sobbing teenagers as Ms. Pollack’s coffin was wheeled out for burial.

None,31," By REUTERSAPRIL 11, 2018, 2:25 P.M. E.D.T. (Reuters) - The Florida school district that includes the high school where a gunman massacred 17 people has rejected its share of new state funding to be used for arming teachers, county officials said on Wednesday. The Feb. 14 attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland ramped up a long-running U.S. debate on gun rights and sparked a youth movement led by survivors of the attack, many of whom have been critical of the idea of arming teachers. The Broward County School Board, which oversees Stoneman Douglas and other schools, said in a statement it had voted unanimously against accepting money from a $67 million statewide program, signed into law last month by Governor Rick Scott as part of a package of gun-control and school safety measures. Board members want Scott, a Republican who earlier this week launched a run for the U.S. Senate, to allow them to allocate the money in other ways, such as providing additional funding for school resource officers (SROs) - trained law enforcement officers that are often already armed.  ""For them to dictate to us that this money can only be spent to arm our employees is a travesty,"" school board member Robin Bartleman said in a phone interview on Wednesday.  ""What I want to see happen is the legislature free up that money to districts so we can use it for mental health programs or to hire more SROs.""      In addition to creating the fund to allow school staff to be trained and deputized to carry guns on the job, Scott signed measures that raised the state's minimum age to buy any firearm to 21 and imposed a three-day waiting period on gun purchases. The $67 million Aaron Feis Guardian Program, named after a coach who was among those killed in the Parkland massacre, allows local sheriffs and school districts to opt out if they wish. Most classroom teachers are excluded from volunteering for the program, a compromise aimed at earning the support of the governor and many lawmakers who had initially opposed the idea. A 19-year-old man who had been kicked out of Stoneman Douglas used a legally purchased AR-15 assault-style rifle in the February attack. An armed sheriff's deputy had been present at the school campus in suburban Fort Lauderdale when the third-deadliest school shooting by a single gunman in U.S. history began, but failed to enter the building where the shooting was occurring.

Washington,32," Supported by By Linda Qiu and Justin Bank A heavily armed young man is accused of killing 17 people after opening fire on terrified students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday. It was the third mass shooting in the past four months in the United States.  Nikolas Cruz, who has been linked to a history of mental illness, is believed to have used a legally obtained AR-15 in the shooting. The attack has led to widespread conversations about links between gun violence and mental illness, and how lawmakers and interest groups are debating potential policy responses. Below is a look at some facts and falsehoods uttered by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin; Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont; and others in the wake of Wednesday’s shooting.  Mr. Ryan’s claim reflects a common misconception. According to various polls, roughly half of Americans either believe that failing to identify people with mental health problems is the primary cause of gun violence or that addressing mental health issues would be a major deterrent.  That conclusion is not shared by experts or widely accepted research.  In an analysis of 235 mass killings, many of which were carried out with firearms, 22 percent of the perpetrators could be considered mentally ill. Overall, mass shootings by people with serious mental illness represent 1 percent of all gun homicides each year, according to the book “Gun Violence and Mental Illness” published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2016.  To be sure, gun violence experts contacted by New York Times reporters have said that barring sales to people who are deemed dangerous by mental health providers could help prevent mass shootings. But the experts said several more measures — including banning assault weapons and barring sales to convicted violent criminals — more effective.  And, as The Times has reported, Americans do not appear to have more mental health problems than other developed nations of a comparable size, which experience far fewer mass shootings.  Some further research:  A 2016 academic study estimated that just 4 percent of violence is associated with serious mental illness alone. “Evidence is clear that the large majority of people with mental disorders do not engage in violence against others, and that most violent behavior is due to factors other than mental illness,” the study concluded.   A 2015 study found that less than 5 percent of gun-related killings in the United States between 2001 and 2010 were committed by people diagnosed with mental illness.  As John T. Monahan, a professor specializing in psychology and law at the University of Virginia, told The Times: “Two things typically happen in the wake of a mass shooting. First, politicians claim that mental illness is the major cause of violence in America. Then, advocates for people with mental illness respond by denying there is any relationship whatsoever between mental illness and violence. Both groups are wrong. Research shows that the association between mental illness and violence is not strong, but it does exist.” The figure is drawn from a list maintained by the advocacy group Every Town for Gun Safety. As the group explains on its site, the total includes “any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building or on a school campus or grounds.” As The Washington Post, The Washington Examiner and other outlets have pointed out, that includes some incidents that most people would not consider school shootings. For example, the list includes suicides, like a Florida man who shot himself in the parking lot of a school while it was closed. And it also includes accidents like a Minnesota third-grader who pulled the trigger on a police officer’s holstered weapon, injuring no one.  Israeli officials and experts rejected this version of events after a similar claim was made by Wayne LaPierre, the president of the National Rifle Association, after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in which 20 children and six adults were killed.  “Israel had a whole lot of school shootings until they did one thing. They said, ‘We’re going to stop it,’ and they put armed security in every school, and they have not had a problem since then,” Mr. LaPierre said in December 2012 on NBC.  Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, told The New York Daily News at the time that the situations in the United States and Israel were “fundamentally different” and said that the measures that Israel enacted were a response to terrorism. “What removed the danger was not the armed guards, but an overall antiterror policy and antiterror operations, which brought street terrorism down to nearly zero over a number of years,” Mr. Palmor said.  After Mr. Trump focused on mental health in his national address on Thursday in response to the Parkland shooting, many journalists, activists and others, like Mr. Kimmel,  noted the repeal of a rule that would have prevented “seriously mentally ill” people from purchasing guns.  Federal law already bars anyone who “has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution” from purchasing a gun. And a majority of states have laws requiring them to report mental health information to the national background check system. But gaps in the system still exist.  After the Newtown shooting, President Obama proposed adding another data source to the background check system: reports from the Social Security Administration of people who receive disability benefits through a third party because of mental impairments. According to a 2016 White House fact sheet, the rule would have affected 75,000 people.  It was opposed by the National Rifle Association, but also the American Civil Liberties Union, which said the rule violated civil rights. Some disability rights groups also argued against the rule on the basis that it perpetuated stigmas about mental illness.  Mr. Trump signed a congressional resolution that expressed disapproval of the proposed rule in February 2017, nine months before compliance would have been required.

Express,33," By DANIEL VICTORMARCH 29, 2018 Laura Ingraham, a Fox News host, apologized under pressure on Thursday for taunting a survivor of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., as at least eight companies confirmed they would pull advertising from her show. The dispute began Wednesday when Ms. Ingraham shared an article about the student, David Hogg, 17, getting rejected from colleges and accused him of whining about it. 
            David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it. (Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA...totally predictable given acceptance rates.) https://t.co/wflA4hWHXY         In response, Mr. Hogg, who has rapidly become a prominent advocate for gun-control policies, called on Ms. Ingraham’s advertisers to boycott her show. Eight of the companies, TripAdvisor, Wayfair, Hulu, Nutrish, Johnson & Johnson, Nestle, Atlantis Paradise Island and Stitch Fix, said they were removing their ads. A ninth, Expedia, said it had recently pulled its advertising but declined to say when. As news of the boycotts began coming out on Thursday, Ms. Ingraham apologized. “On reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week, I apologize for any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland,” she said, extending an invitation for Mr. Hogg to appear on the show.  Mr. Hogg said he was unimpressed by the apology. “She only apologized after we went after her advertisers,” he said. “It kind of speaks for itself.”  Mr. Hogg said he has grown accustomed to being criticized, often ruthlessly. But to hear a prominent television host mock his college rejections was “extremely frustrating,” he said. “I’m not going to stoop to her level and go after her on a personal level,” he said. “I’m going to go after her advertisers.” Ms. Ingraham’s remarks went too far for TripAdvisor, which said it planned to stop advertising on the show and that it did not “condone the inappropriate comments made by this broadcaster.” “We also believe Americans can disagree while still being agreeable, and that the free exchange of ideas within a community, in a peaceful manner, is the cornerstone of our democracy,” the company said through a spokesman. “In our view, these statements focused on a high school student cross the line of decency.” Nutrish, a pet food brand owned by Rachael Ray, said it was “in the process of removing our ads from Laura Ingraham’s program.” “The comments she has made are not consistent with how we feel people should be treated,” the company said. Wayfair, an e-commerce company, said in a statement that it supports “open dialogue and debate on issues,” but that it would stop advertising on Ms. Ingraham’s show.      “The decision of an adult to personally criticize a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our values,” the company said.  Nestle said it had “no plans to buy ads on the show in the future,” while Stitch Fix, a clothing box subscription service, said it had pulled its advertisements. Johnson & Johnson said it had done so as well, while Hulu said on Twitter, “We are no longer advertising on Laura Ingraham’s show and are monitoring all of our ad placements carefully.” Expedia said it had “recently pulled the advertising” from Ms. Ingraham’s show, but it did not elaborate on timing or whether the decision was related to her comments. Consumers have increasingly used social media to demand that advertisers respond to a series of controversies, particularly those involving Fox News hosts. Last year, more than 50 brands pulled ads from “The O’Reilly Factor” after The New York Times reported on settlements that the show’s host, Bill O’Reilly, had made with women who accused him of sexual harassment or other inappropriate behavior, which contributed to his ouster. Similar boycott calls around the host Sean Hannity did not gain as much traction. In November, several brands that initially said they would stop advertising on Mr. Hannity’s show after comments he made about Roy S. Moore, the former Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama, later walked back those statements. Keurig ignited a firestorm when it said that it planned to halt ads on the show, as Mr. Hannity’s fans posted videos of themselves destroying its machines. The company’s chief executive later apologized to employees for any negativity they had faced from the “appearance of ‘taking sides.’” Mr. Hogg said he was glad that some companies had pulled their ads from Ms. Ingraham’s program, but called it “just the beginning.” If all of her advertisers pulled out, he said, “we can show that if you continue to bully the students that survived a mass murder, there’s going to be consequences.” “Deal with the issues, not the individuals,” he said. In February, Ms. Ingraham drew rebukes from N.B.A. players after she said the basketball superstars LeBron James and Kevin Durant should withhold their political opinions. Mr. James had spoken about his experience as an African-American man and criticized President Trump. “Must they run their mouths like that?” she asked, adding, “Keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said, shut up and dribble.” Mr. Hogg plans to study either journalism or political science, he said. He confirmed that he had been rejected from four schools: University of California, Los Angeles; University of California, San Diego; University of California, Santa Barbara; and University of California, Irvine.  He said he had been accepted by Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo; California State University, San Marcos; and Florida Atlantic University, but has not decided which school he’ll attend.

National,34," Supported by We spoke to survivors of mass shootings and others affected by them about the demonstrations planned for Saturday. By Jonah Engel Bromwich The attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last month was the latest in what seems like an inescapable pattern to proponents of gun safety: gunfire, thoughts and prayers, funerals and public mourning, until the next time. But the survivors of past shootings say that the students in Parkland have given them hope. Many of those students will be in Washington on Saturday leading the March for Our Lives demonstration. We spoke this week to a tiny sampling of the thousands of people whose lives have been affected by past mass shootings. 15 Killed, 21 Injured  Ms. Strassner was a freshman at Columbine High School in April 1999 when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 of her classmates and a teacher, before turning their guns on themselves.  “In so many regards, we were the first,” she said. “We thought the change was going to be immediate because it was so horrific.” Now 33, she has spent the majority of her life working to get past that day. Ms. Strassner is married with four children and lives in Colorado. Over the years, she has been broken anew by other school shootings. She gave up on gun control after the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Conn., when the deaths of 20 children did not lead to effective federal legislation. “But something about Parkland has been different,” she said. “Those wonderful children have taken a stand, and they have done it with courage and eloquence. They truly have inspired a nation. They’ve inspired a nation and they have inspired me.”  She will be marching in Colorado on Saturday, wearing a class of 2002 Columbine sweatshirt. “Since Parkland, my boxing gloves are back on,” she said. “I had them off after Sandy Hook. I just have this feeling that we are in a moment where change is possible.”  10 killed, 7 injured Mr. Thunder was 15 in 2005, when his classmate Jeff Weise killed five students at Red Lake Senior High School. Mr. Thunder was shot in the hip. (Mr. Weise also fatally shot two school employees, his grandfather, his grandfather’s companion and himself in a wave of violence on the reservation of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians.) Mr. Thunder had been one of a few people at the school who reached out to Mr. Weise and tried to make conversation with him. Mr. Thunder said that he has been trying to forget about what happened ever since. But he pays close attention to news of mass shootings. “I’ll sit there and watch live coverage and find out what happened,” he said. “I get pretty interested in it, but I try not to let it bring me down.” Mr. Thunder is struck by how often shooters have histories of being bullied and wishes, every time, that they had known someone they could talk to. He said that he hopes the marchers on Saturday reach troubled children who are thinking about perpetrating a shooting, “so that they know there’s help out there.”  Mr. Thunder will not be attending a march. But he said that he was planning to watch the coverage closely. 33 killed, 17 injured Reema Samaha was 18 in the spring of 2007. She was a freshman at Virginia Tech University, where she planned to major in urban planning and minor in French. She was one of 33 people killed by Seung-Hui Cho in what is still the deadliest school shooting in modern American history. Her father, Joseph, says that every shooting since rewinds the videotapes, bringing him back to 2007. Mr. Samaha, who is the president of the Virginia Tech Victims Family Outreach Foundation, says that the Stoneman Douglas students have followed a trajectory that is familiar to him. Mr. Samaha favors “practical and actionable solutions.” “I’m looking for common ground, what we can work on together without yelling and screaming at each other,” he said. “I personally focus on getting to the root of what the issue is and trying to resolve the problem in a nonpartisan fashion.” 12 killed, 70 injured Mr. Sullivan was not an especially political person until July 20, 2012. It was his son Alex’s 27th birthday, and to celebrate, a dozen of Alex’s co-workers from Red Robin took him to a screening of “The Dark Knight Rises.” There, James Eagan Holmes fatally shot 12 people, including Alex, and injured 70, including 58 who were hit by gunfire. It was the deadliest mass shooting in decades. Mr. Sullivan became active in Democratic politics immediately following his son’s death. He lost a bid for Colorado’s State Senate in 2016, and is embarking on a bid for the statehouse in November. He said he hopes this weekend’s march will reach people who can make a difference. He happened to be in Las Vegas last fall when 58 people were killed and hundreds more were injured at a country music concert. He bought a local newspaper “to read each and every name, look at their faces, know a little bit about them, because some of those people could have been doing the same thing the day after Alex was murdered.”  The paper ran a list of the deadliest mass shootings in the United States. Aurora was not on it. 26 killed, 2 injured Shortly after the shooting in Newtown, Conn., Ms. Basch, a novelist who lives in the town, wrote about the rawness of her feelings. She did not have children at the school, nor were her relatives directly affected by the shooting. Mindful of the grief of those who had lost their children, she placed an essay in a small literary magazine, N+1, hoping that she could communicate to the outside world what her town was going through. In the essay, she recalls telling one of the reporters who flooded Newtown after the shooting: “Everyone is connected here. There are concentric circles of grief. But no one, not one person, is untouched.”  And then, when she finishes talking, she immediately feels ashamed: “Why can’t I keep my mouth shut?” Ms. Basch said this week that when she was young, she was determined to clean up the mess adults had made of the world. She believes that the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School may be able to succeed where she said her generation failed.  “I really hope they don’t get to be this age and feel the way I feel,” she said. “It feels terrible that we’ve let our children down.”  13 killed, 3 injured Jolanda Arnold | Washington Navy Yard Ms. Arnold will be marching in Washington on Saturday, the city where her husband, Michael, was killed on Sept. 16, 2013. Eleven others were murdered that morning at the Washington Navy Yard, and the gunman, Aaron Alexis, was killed by the police. For Ms. Arnold, every mass shooting from then on brought back the devastation of that day. She thinks of the families and friends of those killed, and of how shootings reverberate outward, affecting hundreds.  But she has been heartened by the students of Stoneman Douglas. “They could have all crawled in a hole and said, ‘Oh, poor us,’” she said. “They really haven’t. Instead, they’ve said: ‘We’re not going to take this. The adults may go, “O.K., fine,” but we’re not going to take this.’” 17 killed, 17 injured Ms. Whitney, a senior at Stoneman Douglas, and the other organizers of the March for Our Lives have concrete aims. They hope to raise awareness about gun control, making it a central issue in the November midterms. Ms. Whitney hopes to encourage three of every five people between the ages of 18 and 23 to vote.  When the fire alarm went off at the school last month, she began to leave her classroom. But something was off; there had already been a fire drill that day. Seconds later, she heard gunshots and ran back inside, huddling with 64 other students hidden in a storage closet for two hours.  Asked what she hopes to accomplish this weekend, she paused. “No one should ever have to go through what we went through,” she said, finally. “I’m going to do everything in my power and all my friends are — we’re going to try our best to make sure that this isn’t normal. It shouldn’t be normal, and we’re not going to let it be normal.” Jonah Engel Bromwich is a general assignment reporter based in New York.

NEW YORK —  A conservative commentator who tweeted about using ""a hot poker"" to sexually assault a 17-year-old survivor of the Florida high school shooting has lost a second St. Louis broadcast job. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Esther-Mireya Tejeda of Entercom Communications said Tuesday night that KFTK-FM has ""parted ways"" with Jamie Allman. His radio show was among the biggest morning drive-time draws. The cancellation came just one day after Sinclair Broadcast Group announced that Allman's KDNL-TV show had been canceled and that Allman had resigned. Allman hasn't responded to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment. Businesses pulled advertising from Allman's shows after he sent the March 26 tweet targeting David Hogg, who has pushed for stricter gun control since 17 people were killed at his high school in February.

Express,36," By JULIE TURKEWITZ and NIRAJ CHOKSHIFEB. 15, 2018 PARKLAND, Fla. — For the latest on the Florida school shooting, read Friday’s live updates. David Hogg stood in the Florida sun on Thursday, not far from his now shuttered school, and described the events of the day before. Mr. Hogg, 17, a lanky senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and the student news director there, was in his environmental science class when a single shot rang out, echoing down the hallways. His teacher pulled the door shut, but soon the fire alarm began to blare. Then, he said, came the sound of thousands of student footsteps, and Mr. Hogg and his classmates raced out the door, joining a giant wave of teenagers. “There was a tsunami of people running in one specific direction away from something,” he said, “and that’s what we were doing. It was almost like there was a shark coming along and we were a school of fish. And we were running from that armed man.” A janitor appeared and began to wave. “Stop, stop!” he said. “Go over here!” Then the school chef opened a door to her office, Mr. Hogg said, and hurried the teenagers in — first 10, then 20, then some 30 or 40 students crowded in the office. They shut off the lights. And then students turned to their phones, and began the horrifying experience of watching a school shooting unfold at their own school — through the news apps on their phones. While they were hiding, Mr. Hogg proceeded to interview his classmates on camera about their beliefs on gun policy. Mr. Hogg’s younger sister, 14, was also in the building. Two of her best friends were among the 17 people who died, he said. “On a national scale, I’m not surprised at all,” he said of the shooting. “And that’s just sad. The fact that a student is not surprised that there was another mass shooting — but this time it was at his school — says so much about the current state that our country is in, and how much has to be done.” The violence must stop, he said, issuing a call to pressure lawmakers to act to make schools safer. “We need to do something. We need to get out there and be politically active. Congress needs to get over their political bias with each other and work toward saving children’s lives.” In an interview with CNN earlier on Thursday, Mr. Hogg expressed his frustration with politicians in simpler terms: “We’re children,” he said. “You guys are the adults.”

Thank you.”

Sarah Crescitelli, a freshman, said Wednesday that she was in drama class when gunshots rang out. While hiding with about 40 others in a storage room, she texted her mother, telling her, “If I don’t make it, I love you.”      Others, who spoke to CNN, described how a large group hid in an R.O.T.C. room where they used Kevlar blankets from a marksmanship class for protection. At a news conference on Thursday, Robert Runcie, the superintendent of Broward County Public Schools, called for a national conversation on passing “sensible” gun control laws. “Our students are asking for that conversation,” he said. “And I hope we can get it done in this generation. But if we don’t, they will.” Julie Turkewitz reported from Parkland, Fla., and Niraj Chokshi from New York.  ",2018-02-15,0.5560279,Thursday
None,37," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 12, 2018, 7:31 A.M. E.D.T. DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. —  A chemistry teacher at the Florida school where 17 people were shot to death has been arrested. Authorities say he left a loaded gun in a public restroom, where a drunk homeless man picked it up and fired it. No one was injured, but the teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School is now charged with failing to safely store his weapon. A Broward Sheriff's report says 43-year-old Sean Simpson, who carries a concealed weapons permit, left his Glock 9 mm in a restroom at the Deerfield Beach Pier on Sunday. He told deputies he was returning to get it when he heard a gunshot, and found the man holding the pistol. Records show the teacher posted a $250 bond. It's not known whether he has a lawyer.

National,38," By JESS BIDGOOD, AMY HARMON, MITCH SMITH and MAYA SALAMFEB. 15, 2018 As gunshots echoed through the high school, a geography teacher, Scott Beigel, 35, paused to usher stragglers into his classroom before locking the door, only to be shot and killed himself as the shooter strode by. A parent, Jennifer Zeif, credited Mr. Beigel for saving her son’s life. Her son, Matthew, 14, had been the last one to slip inside the class, just ahead of Mr. Beigel. Seconds later, the room filled with a smoky haze, Matthew said, and he turned to see his teacher lying near the door, pale and bleeding. “Mr. Beigel could have passed Matthew up and gone in the classroom first,” Ms. Zeif said. “In that case, Matthew would have been the one in the doorway.” On Thursday, as officials identified 17 people killed in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., some of the victims, like Mr. Beigel, were remembered for having tried to spare others in the moments of chaos that unfolded inside the school. Aaron Feis, a popular football coach who was killed, also had tried to protect students, officials said. “He was that kind of guy,” said Jack Fris, a former football player at the school. Friends said they were not surprised that Mr. Beigel, a much-beloved figure at a Pennsylvania summer camp that he attended and later helped to run, had put his students’ safety above his own. “Thousands of people at Camp Starlight looked up to Scott,” said Grant Williams, 33, an emergency room nurse who worked with Mr. Beigel at the camp for several summers and was mourning long-distance with former camp counselors and campers on Thursday. “He was someone you strive to be like,” said another former Starlight counselor. At the Florida high school, teachers and students were among the dead. There was a soccer player, a student nicknamed Guac and a trombonist in the marching band. Eight of the victims were girls and young women; nine were boys and men. They ranged from 14 years old to 49. These are some of their stories. Alyssa Alhadeff, 14, had played competitive soccer since she was 3 years old. Like any athlete, she had her ups and downs. But when her club, Parkland, faced off against the rival team from Coral Springs on Feb. 13, she was at the top of her game. “Her passing was on, her shooting was on, her decision-making was on,” her mother, Lori Alhadeff, recalled. With her outgoing personality, Alyssa had a wide circle of friends at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. She placed first in a debate tournament, was taking Algebra 2 and Spanish 3, and was honing her skills as an attacking midfielder. The score at what was to be her last time on the soccer field was 1-0, Parkland. “I was so proud of her,” her mother said. “I told her it was the best game of her life.” Martin Duque Anguiano, a 14-year-old freshman, was “a very funny kid, outgoing and sometimes really quiet,” his brother, Miguel Duque, wrote on a GoFundMe page for funeral expenses. “He was sweet and caring and loved by all his family,” Miguel wrote. “Most of all he was my baby brother.” Nicholas Dworet, a promising high school swimmer, took a recruiting visit to the University of Indianapolis a few weeks ago. After a group dinner, he pulled the coach aside and said he wanted to compete there after he graduated this spring. “He was an instant part of our family,” said Jason Hite, the university’s swim coach. Mr. Hite said Nicholas, 17, had received an academic scholarship and planned to study physical therapy. University officials and a youth swim team in Florida said Nicholas was among those killed on Wednesday. A post on the Facebook page for TS Aquatics, the Florida club where he swam, described Nicholas as an amazing person who had been “on a major upswing in his life.” Nicholas had improved academically and athletically since starting high school, Mr. Hite said, and his mentors in Florida “felt like the best was still to come for him.” “We were going to continue to groom him to be a future leader for our team,” Mr. Hite said. Mr. Hite said he sent Nicholas a text message on Wednesday afternoon after hearing about the shooting at his school. He got no response. “The saddest thing to me is how much life this kid had and how hard he had worked to change directions and change paths,” Mr. Hite said. “He was really going in the right direction and he had really created some opportunities for himself.” At Stoneman Douglas, Mr. Feis was known to all — an assistant football coach and a security monitor. But he too had graduated from the school, played on the football team, and knew exactly what it was like to be a student in these halls. So he was seen as someone who looked out for students who got in trouble, those who were struggling, those without fathers at home. “They said he was like another father,” Mr. Feis’s grandfather, Raymond, recalled. “He’d go out of his way to help anybody.” School officials said that Mr. Feis, 37, did the same on Wednesday. When there were signs of trouble, they said, he responded immediately to help. “When Aaron Feis died, when he was killed — tragically, inhumanely — he did it protecting others; you can guarantee that,” said Scott Israel, the sheriff of Broward County. “I don’t know when Aaron’s funeral is,” Sheriff Israel said. “I don’t know how many adults are going to go, but you’ll get 2,000 kids there.” In Parkland, Austin Lazar, a student, recalled his former coach as cheery and selfless. “He always put everybody before himself.” Mr. Feis was married, his family said, and had a daughter, Arielle. Jaime Guttenberg, 14, danced nonstop. Sometimes she went on for hours, her aunt, Ellyn Guttenberg, said. Jaime was warm, too, always taking Ms. Guttenberg’s son, who has special needs, under her wing. Jaime’s Facebook page, now memorialized, shows photos of her dancing, hanging out with friends, enjoying the beach and snuggling a dog. Her father, Fred Guttenberg, posted this on Facebook: “I am broken as I write this trying to figure out how my family gets through this.” Christopher Hixon, 49, the school’s athletic director, was a well-known figure in Florida high school sports. One man, Jose Roman, posted on social media that Mr. Hixon was “a great coach and an awesome motivator” when he was a freshman athlete years ago. Mr. Hixon was named athletic director of the year in 2017 by the Broward County Athletics Association. Luke Hoyer, 15, spent last Christmas with his extended family in South Carolina, where he bowled, joined in a big holiday meal and swapped stories with relatives. A cousin, Grant Cox, who was at the Christmas gathering said the family had been told by the police that Luke, a freshman at Stoneman Douglas, was among those killed on Wednesday. Mr. Cox said Luke was a basketball player who was ambitious about the sport and admired N.B.A. stars like LeBron James and Stephen Curry. “I know Luke loved his family,” Mr. Cox said. “I know he did. He had a huge heart.” “He was quiet, but a very happy individual,” he said. Cara Loughran, 14, loved the beach. She adored her cousins. And she was an excellent student, her family said. “We are absolutely gutted,” by her death, her aunt, Lindsay Fontana, wrote in a Facebook post. “While your thoughts are appreciated, I beg you to DO SOMETHING. This should not have happened to our niece Cara and it cannot happen to other people’s families.” Gina Montalto, 14, was identified in local news accounts as a member of her school’s winter color guard team. Andy Mroczek, who has worked as a choreographer at Stoneman Douglas, posted a tribute to Gina on Facebook. “We lost a beautiful soul tonight,” he wrote. People often spelled Joaquin Oliver’s first name wrong, so he went with a snappy nickname: Guac. He played basketball in the city recreational league — his jersey number was 2 — and he loved to write, filling a notebook with poetry, said Julien Decoste, a close friend of Joaquin’s and a fellow senior at Stoneman Douglas. “Guac and I always wanted to graduate together and prove everyone wrong, that we would be successful together,” Julien said. On Tuesday, Joaquin, 17, asked Julien to help out at his next basketball game, which was scheduled for Thursday. “I’ll be there,” Julien texted his friend. “Good looks brotha,” Joaquin responded. On Wednesday, as he hid inside a closet during the shooting, Julien texted Joaquin to check in. “You good?” Julien texted. “Bro I need you to answer me please.” Alaina Petty, 14, had helped do cleanup work in Florida after Hurricane Irma, her family said in a statement, and she was an active member of a volunteer group with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “Her selfless service brought peace and joy to those that had lost everything during the storm,” the family’s statement said. “While we will not have the opportunity to watch her grow up and become the amazing woman we know she would become, we are keeping an eternal perspective.” Alaina was also a member of the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, her family said. Meadow Pollack, 18, was a senior at the high school who was planning to go to Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla., next year, according to her father, Andrew Pollack, who said his daughter was among the dead. “She was just unbelievable,” Mr. Pollack said. “She was a very strong-willed young girl who had everything going for her.” Mr. Pollack described his daughter as smart, beautiful and caring. She worked at her boyfriend’s family’s motorcycle repair business. “She just knew how to get what she wanted all the time,” Mr. Pollack said. “Nothing could ever stop her from what she wanted to achieve.” Helena Ramsay, 17, was smart, kindhearted and thoughtful, her relative, Curtis Page, wrote on Facebook. “Though she was somewhat reserved, she had a relentless motivation towards her academic studies, and her soft warm demeanor brought the best out in all who knew her,” he said, later adding: “She would have started college next year.” Alex Schachter, 14, played the trombone in the Stoneman Douglas marching band, and was proud to have participated in winning a state championship last year. A freshman at the high school, he often played basketball with friends and was “a sweetheart of a kid,” his father, Max Schachter, said. Earlier this week, the two had discussed which classes Alex would take next semester. Mr. Schachter said Alex had loved his mother, who died when he was five years old. His older brother also attends Stoneman Douglas and survived the shooting. Alex “just wanted to do well and make his parents happy,” his father said. Carmen Schentrup, a 2018 National Merit Scholarship semifinalist, was the smartest 16-year-old that her cousin, Matt Brandow, had ever met, he said in a Facebook post. “I’m in a daze right now,” he wrote. Peter Wang, 15, a freshman, helped his cousin, Aaron Chen, adjust when he settled in Florida. “He was always so nice and so generous,” Aaron, 16, said, adding that even though Peter was younger he had worked to be sure Aaron didn’t get bullied when he first arrived. Peter was last seen in his gray uniform for the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, or J.R.O.T.C., on Wednesday. On Thursday, Aaron and another cousin said the authorities had informed the family that Peter was among those killed in the shooting. “He was the kid in school who would be friends with anyone,” said the other cousin, Lin Chen, 24. “He didn’t care about popularity.” Audra D.S.

National,39," By NIRAJ CHOKSHIAPRIL 10, 2018 A conservative commentator in the St. Louis area has lost his television and radio shows after saying on Twitter that he was preparing to use a “hot poker” to assault a survivor of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting. In the crude tweet, Jamie Allman, the commentator, said that he was “hanging out getting ready” to assault David Hogg, one of the outspoken survivors of the shooting in which 17 people were killed. “Busy working; preparing,” Mr. Allman added. (Mr. Allman has since made his Twitter account private.) Mr. Allman had shows on KDNL, an ABC-affiliated television station owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, and KFTK-FM, a radio station owned by Entercom Communications. “We have accepted Mr. Allman’s resignation and his show has been canceled,” Ronn Torossian, an outside spokesman for Sinclair, said by email. A spokeswoman for Entercom said that the broadcaster and Mr. Allman had parted ways. He had been with the radio station for about 12 years, she said.  Mr. Torossian, the chief executive of the public relations firm 5WPR, would not say when Mr. Allman tendered his resignation, which was reported by other publications on Monday. Mr. Allman’s relationship with the radio station was severed on Tuesday. The controversy comes as Sinclair, the country’s largest broadcaster, faces accusations of advancing a right-leaning agenda, fueled recently by widely shared videos of anchors at dozens of stations reciting the same script about bias in the media.  Those videos also reignited a debate over Sinclair’s size and its prolonged battle to complete a $3.9 billion blockbuster merger with Tribune Media. Mr. Allman’s tweet, which was posted more than two weeks ago, became the focus of a campaign to pressure advertisers to drop his show, “The Allman Report.” Late last week, a health care provider, a real estate company and a steakhouse announced that they had withdrawn from the program. That campaign was reminiscent of a similar and successful effort aimed at the Fox News host Laura Ingraham after she accused Mr. Hogg, a high school senior, of complaining about being rejected from some colleges. Mr. Hogg weighed in on the controversy over Mr. Allman’s comment on Twitter on Monday night, suggesting that he found it to be a distraction from the debate over gun violence. 
            I wish they would actually focus on what matters here like the 4 kids shot in #LibertyCity recently or simply the people that die across America everyday due of gun violence.         A Twitter account for Mr. Allman’s television show was taken down on Tuesday and his personal account is now private, meaning only those he approves can read what he shares on the social network. Mr. Allman could not be reached for comment.

Washington,40," By JONATHAN MARTIN and ALEXANDER BURNSFEB. 27, 2018 Polls show solid support for stricter laws, especially after mass shootings. But there is also deep disagreement, staunch opposition and growing disenchantment with gun control. WASHINGTON — In Minnesota, a Democratic candidate for governor with rural roots is running from his past affiliation with the National Rifle Association. In South Florida, endangered House Republicans are embracing an assault weapons ban. And in Ohio, the moderate Democratic candidate for governor, feeling heat from his left, is embracing a more stringent gun-violence platform than his past relations with the N.R.A. would suggest. The mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., has thrust gun rights into the midterm campaign, scrambling traditions in both parties as the debate shifts toward firearms restrictions. A host of House Republicans and a handful of the party’s governors are beginning to distance themselves from their party’s gun-rights orthodoxy, signaling an openness to restrictions that reflects the rising anger among suburban voters. But Democrats are under even more pressure from within to recalibrate their position on the issue. Even as they attempt to reclaim governorships and congressional seats in red-tinged regions, moderates recognize that bearing the mark of the N.R.A. could be fatal in their primaries.  “I’ve always respected law-abiding citizens’ right to be responsible gun owners and many people in Ohio feel strongly about that,” said Richard Cordray, the leading Democratic candidate for governor in Ohio and former head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who first must beat the left-wing candidate, Dennis Kucinich, for the nomination. “But I also think people with their eyes and ears open are seeing some of these tragedies, of all different kinds in our society, and thinking we need to do more.”  In recent years, both major parties have honored something of a nonaggression pact. As the Republican Party’s moderates thinned out, few Republicans strayed from the gun-rights line, and Democrats in competitive regions deliberately avoided making guns central, fearing that it was far more of a voting issue for gun advocates than gun control supporters. In Congress and in most states, gun policy was largely kept off the legislative agenda. But with mass shootings becoming agonizingly routine, and Americans demanding action after 17 Florida teenagers and faculty members were murdered on Valentine’s Day, this election may be more like 1994, when an assault weapons ban thrust guns to the fore. “This is a tipping point,” said Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State, the head of the Democratic Governors Association and one of those lawmakers who lost his House seat after voting for the 1994 ban. “I think what people are looking for is more independent thought and less slavish devotion to the N.R.A.” On the Republican side, Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, who runs the Republican Governors Association but does not have to run again, gave his party a blunt warning about the political challenge staring it in the face: voters “particularly among suburban women,” are mobilizing for gun control. “When you have something put into stark dramatization like Florida, then I think that gets people’s attention. And they say, ‘There’s got to be certain things we can do,’” said Mr. Haslam, who called for raising the age limit on gun purchases over the N.R.A.’s opposition. Yet it was not at all clear whether Congress will take up a gun control measure anytime soon. Before a planned bipartisan gun summit meeting on Wednesday at the White House, Speaker Paul D. Ryan told reporters on Tuesday that “we shouldn’t be banning guns for law-abiding citizens.” He indicated that lawmakers would focus on narrow measures and added, “We also want to make sure that we protect people’s due process rights and legal constitutional rights while making sure that people who should not get guns don’t get them.”  The political peril for each party lies in divergent parts of the country: For Republicans, ignoring voters’ fears about gun violence could take a pronounced toll in the House, where the party is defending several dozen districts around major cities — including Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Diego — where Mr. Trump is deeply disliked and the N.R.A. has little following to speak of. On the Democratic side, it is in the more rural states — key to Democrats’ hopes in Senate and governors’ races — where Democratic supporters of gun rights have scrambled to react. In some cases, the rapidly shifting conversation on guns has collided with primary elections that party leaders like Mr. Inslee are hoping do not grow too nasty. In 2018, Democrats’ ability to compete in statewide elections in the Midwest and in the South may depend on candidates’ ability to court gun owners, many of whom fiercely oppose new regulations. Until recently, liberal Democrats largely tolerated such overtures as a political necessity. Just last week, Conor Lamb, a Democrat running a tenacious special election campaign in a conservative House district in southwestern Pennsylvania, rebuffed calls for new gun laws after the Parkland shooting. 
                When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.             But the grim spectacle of students, churchgoers and concert attendees being killed by individuals wielding military-style semiautomatic rifles has mobilized gun control advocates in a new way — and pushed even red- and purple-state Democrats to move abruptly in their direction. Some who have in the past sought to placate the N.R.A. are now attempting to make amends with the left: In Minnesota, Representative Tim Walz, a Democratic candidate for governor embroiled in a contested primary, posted an apologetic note on Facebook after the Parkland shooting, endorsing an assault weapons ban and acknowledging “criticisms from those who take issue with my past campaign contributions from the N.R.A.” Mr. Walz, a military veteran from rural southern Minnesota whom the N.R.A. has endorsed in the past, said he is now determined to “get the N.R.A. out of the way, and get us to the common-sense solutions that we all agree on.”      But his Democratic opponents see an opening. “It has become a huge issue,” said Rebecca Otto, the Democratic state auditor. “The only thing that has changed about Congressman Walz is he’s now running for governor.” In South Carolina, State Representative James Smith, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for governor, has faced attacks in the primary race from a businessman, Phil Noble, for having received an “A” rating from the N.R.A. for several years. In Ohio, Mr. Cordray unveiled a more stringent gun violence platform last week amid criticism from Mr. Kucinich of his past relationship with the N.R.A. Mr. Cordray said in an interview that the Parkland shooting had prompted a reassessment of existing policies even among people who back broader gun rights. He has called for greatly expanded background checks and said lawmakers should “rethink” regulation of assault weapons, stopping short of demanding an outright ban. Mr. Cordray also cautioned that there are many voters in rural areas who “feel strongly about the Second Amendment and their right to have guns for hunting, for self-defense.”  In Florida, Gwen Graham, whose primary political calling card has been her ability to win over Republican voters, wasted no time calling for new gun regulations after the Parkland shooting, including a suspension on sales of AR-15 rifles. But Ms. Graham, who previously represented a conservative stretch of the state’s panhandle in Congress, will surely face scrutiny in her primary for making more pro-gun comments when she was a congressional candidate facing opposition from the N.R.A. Even before the Florida shooting, however, the ranks of staunchly N.R.A.-aligned Democrats had dwindled to the point of near-extinction. After the party’s losses in the 2010 and 2014 elections, only a small group of Democrats from rural, solidly Republican areas remain in Congress. Of the five Senate Democrats who voted against a 2013 bill to expand background checks for gun purchasers, just one — Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota — is still in office. But even in Texas, which has a gun culture that can be traced to its founding, the tide in the party is running clearly in the direction of gun restrictions. Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, a Democrat challenging Senator Ted Cruz, acknowledged his support for banning assault weapons would probably not poll well. But, he said, “You’ve got to do what’s right, and people need to know where you are on these issues.” On the Republican side, uniformity on the gun issue has been just as pronounced. Only three Senate Republicans still in office voted for the 2013 background-check bill, drafted by Senators Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, after the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Yet the Florida shooting has plainly caused some Republicans to rethink the issue, or at least to buy time until they can assess whether this latest outcry will fade. In New Jersey, Jay Webber, a Republican state legislator who is running to succeed Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, a retiring Republican, said voters are demanding an “open” conversation on guns. “There’s certainly a desire to do something,” said Mr. Webber, who has been backed by gun-rights activists in the past. But a number of Republicans facing contested primaries and courting the right have lurched in the other direction, in some cases even targeting their ostensible business allies. In Georgia, for instance, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, a Republican candidate for governor, threatened to retaliate against Delta Air Lines for terminating a discount deal with N.R.A. members. A handful of congressional Republicans have made more determined gestures in the direction of gun regulation over the past two weeks. Representative Brian Mast of Florida, a Republican from near Parkland, and Carlos Curbelo, an endangered Republican in Miami, endorsed an assault weapons ban. Five Republicans from competitive districts are sponsoring a Democratic bill to authorize federal research into gun violence.  Sometimes, said Gov. Ralph S. Northam of Virginia, who ran unapologetically on gun control and routed his Republican rival last year, “You have to be slapped in the face.” A version of this article appears in print on February 28, 2018, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Guns Create a Political Minefield in the Midterms.

Business,41," By JOHN HERRMANFEB. 21, 2018 YouTube’s list of “Trending” videos typically includes funny clips, updates from popular YouTube personalities, movie trailers and viral TV segments. On Wednesday, for a brief time, the No. 1 trending video on YouTube featured David Hogg, a survivor of the massacre last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The caption claimed, falsely, that Mr. Hogg, 17, was not a student, but an “actor.” The video, originally posted last August, was a brief local news segment. In it, Mr. Hogg was interviewed by the CBS affiliate in Los Angeles after witnessing a dispute between a lifeguard and a swimmer at Redondo Beach. On Tuesday, a YouTube user who went under the name “mike m.” copied and re-uploaded the video with a new caption: “DAVID HOGG THE ACTOR....” With that terse descriptor, “mike m.” tapped into conspiracies circulating online that the survivors of the Parkland shooting, many of whom have recently spoken out in favor of gun control, were “crisis actors” hired to do the bidding of left-wing activists.  The reposted video moved its way up the trending list overnight. By Wednesday morning, it had accumulated more than 200,000 views.  “I had no idea where all the attention was coming from,” said “mike m.” in an online chat interview with The New York Times. “I just noticed it started to take off.” Many commenters were confused. “Why is this on trending, especially on news? Nothing special,” wrote one. Others, tipped off by the caption calling Mr. Hogg an actor, knew exactly what they thought they were seeing: “Someone get this kid an Oscar!” one wrote. By noon on Wednesday, YouTube had pulled the video for violating its policy on harassment and bullying. It was not the first time that YouTube had served not just as a source of fringe conspiracy theories, but as an accomplice in their rapid spread. After the massacre in Las Vegas last October, YouTubers filled a void of information about the killer’s motives with dark speculation, crowding the site with videos that were fonts of discredited and unproven information, including claims that the tragedy had been staged. After a mass shooting last November at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., those seeking news about the event on YouTube were overwhelmed by videos falsely claiming it had been a “false flag” attack meant to spur gun control measures or a plot carried out by the so-called antifa (short for anti-fascist) movement. In the wake of this latest tragedy, which left 17 people dead at the school in Parkland, YouTube still seemed caught by surprise by the rise of another video meant to peddle a baseless theory.      “In 2017, we started rolling out changes to better surface authoritative news sources in search results, particularly around breaking news events,” YouTube, which is owned by Google, said in a statement. “We’ve seen improvements, but in some circumstances these changes are not working quickly enough. In addition, last year we updated the application of our harassment policy to include hoax videos that target the victims of these tragedies.”  Unlike the other unhinged clips that have garnered significant attention on YouTube in the recent past, the video of the Parkland survivor originated with neither a conspiracy-oriented media organization like Infowars nor one of the popular YouTubers who have catered to far-right subcultures and fringe political factions. Instead, it was posted to the infrequently updated account run by “mike m.” Up until the reposting of the video featuring Mr. Hogg, the account had fewer than a dozen videos and fewer than 1,000 followers. Although he declined to provide much information about himself or give his full name, “mike m.” said that he was a 51-year-old man living in Idaho. The protests calling for stricter gun control measures come on the heels of other youth movements, but the momentum they have gained makes them stand out. His uploads included a handful of little-watched videos suggesting he is an avid fan of conspiracies. What inspired him to traffic in an unfounded theory about the Parkland shooting — aside from “having more time on my hands these days,” he said — were posts he had seen on the popular conspiracy site Godlike Productions. He pointed to comments on the site that claimed Mr. Hogg had been “coached” before giving interviews to members of the media who covered the massacre. It’s also where he found references to the beach video from last August. Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, Mr. Hogg addressed the explosion of conspiracy theories head-on. “I’m not a crisis actor,” said Mr. Hogg, who had been visiting family and friends when he appeared in the Los Angeles news segment. “I’m someone who had to witness this and live through this and I continue to be having to do that. I’m not acting on anybody’s behalf.” The video posted by “mike m.” rapidly gained steam nonetheless. What propelled this one to popularity — and eventually into YouTube’s promotional apparatus — came from outside the platform. Links to the video proliferated on 4chan, where users have gleefully embraced the conspiracy theories and mocked the shooting victims. When it hit YouTube’s Trending page, some on 4chan celebrated: “TRENDING IN THE USA,” began one thread in the far-right politics board called /pol/. “WE’RE BREAKING THE CONDITIONING.” The “mike m.” video also found traction on Twitter, on Facebook and in stories and comment threads on conspiracy sites. It rose in the circuitous and unexpected manner of a viral video, rather than one that had been calculated to game YouTube’s algorithms by seizing on interest in breaking news or tragedy — it had no catchy headline, no recognizable personality, no vast theorizing. And yet it blasted through YouTube’s safeguards and somehow kept going, exposing the platform as vulnerable to sudden influence from inside and outside its walls. After YouTube removed the video, “mike m.” said his account had received a “strike” — that is how YouTube warns users that they have broken the site’s rules or violated its guidelines. (Three strikes and you’re out.) “I mean, why strike me over a beach confrontation video???” he said. A second video he had posted about the shooting was gaining popularity Wednesday morning, he said, until it, too, was deleted, and another strike was added to his account. Anonymous and remorseless, “mike m” was undeterred. “There is more to this kid than appears on MSM,” he said, using the common shorthand for “mainstream media.” Asked if he would think twice about posting such videos in the future, he said, “No not at all.”  He said he was worried about his account getting deleted, adding: “But I am not going to stop.” A version of this article appears in print on February 22, 2018, on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Lies and Dark Speculation, Rising to No. 1 on YouTube.

National,42," By JULIE BOSMANFEB. 25, 2018 A surge of violent threats, tips and false alarms aimed at schools inundated school districts and police departments in the days after the deadly shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. In Hitchcock, Tex., an 18-year-old student told a teacher last week that he would turn their school into “another Florida,” the police said. In Brethren, Mich., a 17-year-old student was arrested after the sheriff’s office received a call from a principal saying that the student had threatened to attack the high school. An AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle was found at the teenager’s home. A father in Shorewood Hills, Wis., walked into his child’s elementary school on Thursday, entered a classroom and handed the teacher a piece of cardboard with the word “gun” written on it, apparently in an attempt to raise concerns about the school’s security. The move provoked panic, fear and a call to the police department two blocks away. The man was arrested and booked into jail, accused of disorderly conduct. Every school day in the week after Feb. 14, the day of the attack at the Florida high school, at least 50 threats or violent incidents at schools were reported across the country, according to the Educator’s School Safety Network, an advocacy organization that has tracked news reports of threats and violence since 2016. Normally, the group records an average of 10 to 12 incidents a day. The group’s count includes many incidents that turn out to be false alarms or hoaxes.  Experts said that the sharp increase in threats and false alarms in the days since the Florida shooting reflects the unusually intense public conversation and media coverage that have unfolded since that attack. In the tense days that have followed, the experts said, teenagers are borrowing the language of school shootings to provoke or cause turmoil. And anxious school employees are on high alert, watchful for any sign of a potential shooter and quick to summon the police over behavior that, in a different moment, might have been overlooked.  Florida had at least 31 incidents in the week after the shooting, more than any other state, the group said; Ohio followed, with 29; and Kentucky was third, with 24. Other states that experienced unusually high numbers of threats, false alarms or other incidents included California, Georgia, Mississippi, New York, Texas and Virginia. Dozens of teenagers have been arrested in connection with threats, often posted on Twitter or Snapchat. School administrators are scrutinizing students and their backpacks closely; the day after the Florida attack, a student at Clarksburg High School in Montgomery County, Md., was found to have a loaded Glock 9-millimeter handgun in his bag at school, the police said. A student at Pasco High School in Dade City, Fla., was arrested on Friday after a staff member conducting a routine sweep of vehicles in the parking lot discovered an AR-15 rifle and ammunition in the student’s truck. (The school district later said that the gun apparently had been meant for hog hunting.) The police say they are taking all reports seriously in light of the attack in Florida, where law enforcement authorities had been given warnings about the suspect who is accused of fatally shooting 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Scott Israel, the sheriff of Broward County, Fla., said on Thursday that his department had received 23 calls regarding the suspect, Nikolas Cruz, over several years, but may not have followed up on them sufficiently. On Jan. 5, a woman who knew Mr. Cruz called the F.B.I.’s tip hotline saying that she was worried he might resort to slipping “into a school and just shooting the place up.” In that call, made more than a month before the attack, she gave the authorities an unambiguous warning: “I know he’s going to explode.” Aaron Chapin, the chief of the Shorewood Hills Police in Wisconsin, said, “We have to treat every situation as if it’s real.” He added that police departments could become overwhelmed chasing false alarms or threats that turn out to be hoaxes. “If we’re constantly fielding non-actual threats, at some point there’s exhaustion,” he said. The number of threats to schools has risen after previous school shootings as well, including an attack in January in Benton, Ky., where two 15-year-old students were killed, according to Amy Klinger, a founder of the Educator’s School Safety Network and its director of programs. But the jump in threats has been especially pronounced since the Florida attack.      “It’s reflective of the feeling in the country,” Ms. Klinger said. “You have to think about what someone who’s making a threat wants to get out of it. They want chaos, fear, for people to be upset.” That is exactly what occurred in school districts like the one in Orono, Minn., where a high school student wrote last week in an anonymous Twitter post: “Orono is not safe. Today at 12:00 p.m. I will shoot up the school myself.”  The police were called, the school went into lockdown, and teachers and students barricaded doors with metal cabinets and desks. Parents rushed to the school and were kept outside, while they texted and called their children for several hours and waited for updates. The boy who the police say wrote the Twitter post was arrested and charged as a juvenile with making terroristic threats. Correy Farniok, the chief of police in Orono, said the authorities took the threat seriously because of its specificity. Other campuses have closed in recent days in response to vague social media postings. An Instagram post on the former N.F.L. player Jonathan Martin’s verified account, featuring an image of a shotgun, a reference to revenge and the name of his former high school in California, prompted the closing of the school, Harvard-Westlake. Across the nation, students and school employees said they were on alert. Two 16-year-olds in Arlington, Tex., were arrested after tipsters said they scrawled on a wall and wrote online that they were planning to attack their school. At El Camino High School in Whittier, Calif., a school employee said he heard a 17-year-old student telling a classmate, “I guarantee you the school will be shot up in three weeks.” The employee confronted the student and reported him to the police. When investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department searched the boy’s home, they recovered two AR-15 rifles, two handguns and 90 high-capacity magazines. Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based research group, said the attack in Florida seemed to resonate more strongly than most previous attacks, heightening the sensitivity to additional possible threats, at least for now. “You’ve got the threats coming into schools and the bomb scares,” Mr. Wexler said. “But you also have the related part of citizens being more attentive to threats. People are probably recording more situations, and that’s creating a higher sensitivity to the whole issue.” A version of this article appears in print on February 26, 2018, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: A Torrent of Gun Threats, Tips and False Alarms.

NYTNow,43," Supported by By Chris Stanford  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • An outcry echoed across the U.S. on Tuesday, as lawmakers were pressed again to take action after a deadly mass shooting. President Trump called for a ban on so-called bump stocks, devices that allow semiautomatic weapons to be fired more quickly, although they weren’t involved in the attack at a high school in Parkland, Fla., last week. (Watch how bump stocks work.) The president has also signaled that he’s open to legislation to strengthen the national system for background checks, a measure the National Rifle Association also supports. • Nevertheless, gun control activists said they were bracing for another disappointing battle with lawmakers. • A group from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, where 17 people were killed last week, traveled more than 400 miles to Florida’s capital on Tuesday to demand gun control measures. “We definitely have a moral obligation to do something, considering that so many innocent people that we know passed,” one of the students said. State lawmakers, however, rejected an effort to debate an assault weapons ban, in a party-line vote. • The students have emerged as passionate advocates for change, but parts of the right-wing media have portrayed them as pawns and conspiracists. An aide to a Florida legislator was fired on Tuesday after calling the Parkland students actors. • The Rev. Billy Graham preached to millions in stadium events he called crusades, becoming a pastor to presidents and America’s best-known Christian evangelist for more than 60 years. He died today at his home in North Carolina. Mr. Graham took the role of evangelist to a new level, lifting it from canvas tents in small towns to packed stadiums in the world’s major cities. He wrote some 30 books and was among the first to use new communication technologies for religious purposes. • “This is not mass evangelism,” Mr. Graham liked to say, “but personal evangelism on a mass scale.” • The son-in-law of a Russia-based billionaire pleaded guilty on Tuesday to lying to U.S. investigators about his contact with Rick Gates, a former Trump campaign aide. Alex van der Zwaan, a lawyer, also acknowledged deleting emails sought in the special counsel’s inquiry into Russian election interference. It is the seventh criminal case that the team led by Robert Mueller has brought since October. • Separately, Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, is said to be resisting giving up his high-level security access, as John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, pushes to revamp the clearance process. • Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has already been accused of accepting nearly $300,000 in bribes. On Tuesday, one of his top advisers was said to have sought to bribe a judge into dropping an investigation of Mr. Netanyahu’s wife, and several of the leader’s friends and confidants were arrested as part of another inquiry. • Mr. Netanyahu denies the new accusations. He and his associates could face charges of obstructing justice. • The U.S. could hardly be less prepared for the next recession, our economics columnist writes. • Social media companies often fail to enforce their policies against impersonation, an examination by The Times found, enabling the spread of fake news and propaganda — and allowing a global black market in social identities to thrive. • Venezuela  has begun selling a virtual currency, backed by its vast petroleum reserves, to try to address one of the most severe economic collapses of modern times. • Taking the C out of KFC: The fast-food chain was forced to close about half of its 900 outlets in Britain after a chicken shortage. • U.S. stocks were down on Tuesday.

Gerald Holtom, the Briton who designed the peace symbol, was in “deep despair” when he created it on this day in 1958. “I drew myself,” wrote Mr. Holtom, a World War II conscientious objector who was alarmed by the nuclear arms race. “The representative of an individual in despair, with hands palm outstretched outward and downward in the manner of Goya’s peasant before the firing squad.” The symbol also combined the semaphores, or flag-signaling codes, for the letters “N” and “D,” or “Nuclear Disarmament.” The circle around it represented the earth. Later that spring, the symbol appeared on buttons and signs in an antinuclear march to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, a warhead factory in Aldermaston, England. (The march became an annual event.) The symbol, which isn’t trademarked, was embraced by the broader antiwar movement and disparaged by critics as anti-Christian. Mr. Holtom is said to have later expressed a desire that the symbol be inverted so that it resembled hands reaching to the sky. Such a symbol, in addition to being more celebratory of peace, would also evoke the semaphore for the letter “U” — as in “Unilateral Disarmament.” The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which still uses the symbol as its logo, is taking it on an anniversary tour around Britain this year.

Express,44," By MAGGIE ASTORFEB. 20, 2018 An aide to State Representative Shawn Harrison of Florida was fired on Tuesday after claiming falsely that two students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were “actors that travel to various crisis when they happen,” a common far-right conspiracy theory after mass shootings. Mr. Harrison’s district secretary, Benjamin Kelly, made the assertion in an email sent from his state account to a Tampa Bay Times reporter, Alex Leary. Mr. Leary, who posted a screen shot of the email on Twitter, had written about far-right attacks on the students fighting for new gun laws in response to the shooting at their school last week, which killed 17 people. Mr. Kelly’s email referred to Emma González, 18, and David Hogg, 17, two seniors who have been outspoken in the days since the shooting. The Broward County superintendent, Robert W. Runcie, confirmed to The Tampa Bay Times that they were Stoneman Douglas students. Richard Corcoran, the speaker of the Florida House, announced Tuesday evening that he had fired Mr. Kelly at Mr. Harrison’s request. Mr. Harrison confirmed the firing in his own statement on Twitter, shortly after voting against consideration of a bill that would have banned assault rifles like the one used in the Stoneman Douglas shooting. (A motion to take up debate on the bill failed, 36 to 71, on a party-line vote.) What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     “I am appalled at and strongly denounce his comments about the Parkland students,” Mr. Harrison, a Republican representing a district north of Tampa, tweeted, adding that Mr. Kelly had made his remarks “without my knowledge.” Mr. Harrison did not immediately respond to a voice mail message at his Tallahassee office, and the voice mail at his district office was full.  In a tweet confirming his firing, Mr. Kelly said that he had “made a mistake whereas I tried to inform a reporter of information relating to his story regarding a school shooting,” and that Mr. Harrison should not “be held responsible for my error in judgement.”  Mr. Kelly did not respond to a Twitter message asking whether he stood by his claim that the students were actors, and whether his “error in judgment” was in believing that or simply in sharing the belief with a reporter. By 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday, he had made all his tweets private. Earlier in the day, as students boarded a bus to lobby state lawmakers in Tallahassee, Cameron Kasky, a 17-year-old junior at Stoneman Douglas, urged his classmates not to let conspiracy theories distract them. “Over the next couple days, there are a lot of people who are being paid a lot of money to ruin what we are doing,” Mr. Kasky said. “A lot of the people with cameras here are here to help, and a lot of the people with cameras here are here to destroy us.” “Everybody,” he added, “do not let people try to get under your skin. Do not let the disgusting side of the incredibly helpful media hurt you. Do not let these people exploit you. All they want is for you to say something to bring us down so they can shoot more of us.” Julie Turkewitz contributed reporting.

Business,45," Supported by Media Memo By Michael M. Grynbaum In the wake of a deadly mass shooting at a Florida high school, President Trump’s favorite newspaper carried an unusually blunt message on its front page. “Mr. President, Please Act,” read the headline on Friday’s edition of The New York Post, above a photograph of two sobbing students. “We need sensible gun control to help stop the slaughter.” The image evoked the tabloid’s crusading heyday, back when Mr. Trump was a fixture in its pages and headlines demanded that former Mayor David N. Dinkins “Do Something” amid a 1990 crime spree. Friday’s front page turned heads with its full-throated call for gun control, a subject that the tabloid, owned for decades by the conservative news titan Rupert Murdoch, had embraced only tepidly in the past. It was one of the more striking responses from the news media to Wednesday’s killings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., an attack that quickly revived the national debate over restricting access to guns, and why politicians have taken few steps to do so. The shift by The Post, among the friendlier news organizations toward Mr. Trump, was seen by proponents of gun control as a potentially favorable development. In October, after a gunman killed dozens of people at a concert in Las Vegas, the paper editorialized that a 1990s-era assault weapon ban was merely “cosmetic,” and noted that mass shootings accounted “for a fraction” of domestic firearm-related deaths. In Friday’s paper, The Post devoted two full pages to an editorial that called for, among other gun-control measures, the reinstatement of the 1994 federal ban on various assault weapons, which expired in 2004. “Mr. President, this is your moment,” the paper wrote, urging Mr. Trump to “prove how much you truly want to curb the carnage.” Another Murdoch-owned outlet, however, showed no sign of championing gun control measures. FoxNews.com published a tough critique of other networks’ coverage of the shootings, noting that the major network newscasts cited a statistic from an anti-gun group, Everytown for Gun Safety, that 18 school shootings had occurred this year. As other outlets, including The Washington Post, have pointed out, that statistic included a suicide at a closed school and an incident when gunshots were fired in a high school parking lot but no one was injured. The FoxNews.com story charged that news networks had “held up the statistic to slam America as the gun crime rampant hell-scape.” In fact, gun violence remains a significant challenge in American life; since the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., at least 239 school shootings have occurred nationwide. Still, as so often occurs after major news events, false reports gained steam on social media — and in some major news outlets — before the authorities debunked them hours later. The Associated Press, ABC News and even the neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer repeated a claim by a Florida white nationalist group that it had ties to the Parkland killer, Nikolas Cruz. Law enforcement officials later said they had no evidence linking Mr. Cruz to extremist groups. The initial claim was traced to online forums like 4chan, where commenters appeared to gloat about deceiving journalists. More familiar divides among the news media also emerged. The right-leaning Breitbart.com framed coverage of the shooting as a critique of the F.B.I., which Trump supporters have frequently derided as biased against the president. Breitbart took pains to suggest a seemingly damning contrast: the F.B.I.’s fumbling of a tip about the Parkland shooter and the agency’s work investigating allegations of collusion between Russians and Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. S. E. Cupp, a conservative host on HLN, scolded other broadcast journalists for what she called a lack of objectivity. “When it comes to guns, news anchors take off their journalist hats and put on their activist hats,” Ms. Cupp said on Thursday. Some newspapers dedicated their front pages to pleas for action. The Boston Globe ran a giant headline — “We Know What Will Happen Next” — above a column by Nestor Ramos that envisioned a future mass shooting and declared, “There are only three things we don’t know about the next time: Who, where, and how many?” And The Daily News, the crosstown rival of The Post and a longtime supporter of stricter gun laws, ran a provocative, if bleakly predictable, image of a young girl wearing a bulletproof vest on its front page The headline: “Is my school next, Mommy?”        Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS",2018-02-16,0.43594518,Friday
National,46," By JULIE TURKEWITZ and VIVIAN YEEFEB. 20, 2018 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Instead of 10th-grade English and 12th-grade calculus, the teenagers from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., had another funeral to attend. When the grim ceremony was over on Tuesday morning, they hugged their parents goodbye, stashed their backpacks in the bellies of three buses and set off in grief and hope to demand gun control measures from state lawmakers more than 400 miles away. As they were getting on the road, the lawmakers in Tallahassee swiftly rejected an effort to debate an assault weapons ban in a party-line vote that said much about how far apart most Democrats and Republicans are when it comes to guns. In the balcony, some Parkland students who had already made it to the Capitol could be seen crying, hands smothering mouths. It was an early reminder that failure might very well become familiar for these latest, youngest gun control activists, as it has for so many others. Republican lawmakers plan to consider more modest proposals, including raising the minimum age to buy assault rifles, before the session ends in March. Yet a kind of optimism — or maybe just an inability not to believe in their own power — was in the humid air. “This shooting is different from the other ones,” said Daniel Bishop, 16, who sat side-by-side with his sister on the second bus. “Sandy Hook, they were elementary school kids who couldn’t stand up for themselves. Virginia Tech was 2007, a different time. But this one, I just have a gut feeling — something is going to change.” There was little to suggest yet that anything would. But in Battle Creek, Mich., in Bakersfield, Calif., in Toms River, N.J., in Iowa City, and all over South Florida, the flickers of underage protest this week seemed to augur something new: a coast-to-coast challenge to the idea that the Snapchat generation was too young, too frivolous, for politics.  “We definitely have a moral obligation to do something, considering that so many innocent people that we know passed,” said Mr. Bishop’s sister, Julia Bishop, 18. “These adults, these politicians, these lawmakers, these legislators, they were supposed to protect us. And they didn’t.”  Many of the protests around the country have arrived semi-spontaneously, apparently ignited by the impassioned pleas of young Parkland survivors in the hours and days after the shooting last Wednesday. Facebook and Twitter have amplified attendance; Snapchat and Instagram have documented the marches, signs and chants. Some on the left were hopeful that the unsullied voices of teenagers, cutting through the usual tussle over whether gun control advocates were politicizing a tragedy, would move previously unbudgeable lawmakers. Still, the students have faced questions from some conservatives over whether they are being exploited by the left. Bill O’Reilly on Tuesday asked on Twitter, “Should the media be promoting opinions by teenagers who are in an emotional state and facing extreme peer pressure in some cases?” In another sign of the deep entrenchment of guns, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that a state pension plan for Florida teachers held more than $500,000 in shares in the company that manufactured the semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifle that was used in the attack in Parkland. For now, however, there is momentum. From South Florida to Bellingham, Wash., local walkouts were proliferating. A national event has been planned for March 14, the one-month anniversary of the Parkland shooting, when students and teachers plan to leave class for 17 minutes, one minute for each victim. On March 24, students will protest in Washington at an event organized by March for Our Lives, the group formed by Parkland survivors, which has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from celebrities. Another mass walkout is scheduled for April 20, when students will commemorate the 19th year since the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. The organizers of last year’s Women’s March are directing the March 14 walkout. Mostly, though, the adults have gotten out of the way. On Tuesday morning, hundreds of students from West Boca Raton High School in South Florida walked out of class and onto the roads, bound for Stoneman Douglas High, in a march that took Broward County officials by surprise. The authorities abruptly assembled a law enforcement escort for the students, said Todd DeAngelis, a city of Parkland spokesman. They also organized water stations along the way to help students, who walked nearly 11 miles, beat the heat. “These kids may look like they’re summer campers,” said Paul Corin, whose daughter, Jaclyn, helped organize the Parkland caravan to Tallahassee. “But they are fierce warriors.”  In Bakersfield, Calif., about a dozen students and 80 adults marched on Presidents’ Day in support of stricter gun laws. The same day, more than 200 students in Iowa City marched out of school, walked to the Old Capitol downtown and gathered to read the names of the Parkland victims. “The N.R.A. has got to go,” they chanted. “Not one more,” they chanted. “At this point, you’re either with us or against us,” said Lujayn Hamad, a senior at West High School, according to The Iowa City Press-Citizen. “We are dying, and I’m not going to stand for it anymore.” Some of the students of Toms River, N.J., also spent part of Presidents’ Day, a school holiday, massed on the steps of the squat, red brick public library. A young man who described himself as a 16-year-old junior led the crowd in chants of, “Enough is enough! Enough is enough!”      “This is what it’s come to,” he said. “In this country, kids are typically expected to take a back seat to what goes on in politics and policy, and what’s going on right now — it can’t happen like that any longer.” Accusing Congress and state legislators of inaction, he advocated stronger gun restrictions. The other option, he said, was turning schools into armed camps where “I have to be aware if there’s a loud bang in the school, do I know where to go?” The adults who “have the responsibility to take care of these things” have failed, he said. “It’s our generation’s responsibility.” On Tuesday, at least 20 students walked out of Harper Creek High School in Battle Creek, Mich. The principal stood with them, and the district’s superintendent was on hand. Students left class or held gatherings all over South Florida on Monday and Tuesday. There was American Heritage School in Plantation. Olympic Heights High School in suburban Boca Raton. Park Vista Community High School in Lake Worth. Fort Lauderdale High School in Fort Lauderdale. McArthur High School in Hollywood. At South Broward High School, students aimed to participate in a protest almost every day to make their point.  They started with a protest at their school in Hollywood last Friday, and then rallied in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday and at Hollywood City Hall on Monday, said Rachel Donly, a 16-year-old sophomore. “We don’t think anyone is truly listening to us yet,” said Ms. Donly, whose father is a teacher. “So we don’t want to give up. We’re just going to keep fighting.” On the Parkland buses, pillows and sleeping bags had been mushed into the seats. Candy and doughnuts were passed from row to row. Laughter occasionally poked through. But the people the students were traveling for — their fallen classmates, coaches, teachers — were never far from their minds. Anthony Lopez, 16, a junior, was sitting alone in the back. He had scratched out a wish list he planned to deliver to lawmakers. “Ban on military grade weapons (assault weapons, etc.)” he had written. “Universal background check, stricter,” he had added. “Raise age for gun ownership (20+), unless for sport or hunting (16+).” Then the news arrived that the Florida House had refused even to consider a ban on assault weapons. How could lawmakers ignore the activism that had lit up social media, the students wondered. “They know that multiple kids, hundreds of kids, are coming up to the state Capitol, which by the way is extremely far, just to talk to them,” Mr. Bishop said. In the back, Mr. Lopez slammed his head back on the bus seat. He placed a hand on his forehead. “That’s infuriating,” he said. “They’re acting inhuman.” Julie Turkewitz reported from Tallahassee, Fla., and Vivian Yee from New York.

National,47," By AUDRA D. S. BURCH, PATRICIA MAZZEI and JACK HEALYFEB. 16, 2018 PARKLAND, Fla. — Delaney Tarr, a high school senior, cannot remember a time when she did not know about school shootings. So when a fire alarm went off inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and teachers began screaming “Code red!” as confused students ran in and out of classrooms, Ms. Tarr, 17, knew what to do. Run to the safest place in the classroom — in this case, a closet packed with 19 students and their teacher. “I’ve been told these protocols for years,” she said. “My sister is in middle school — she’s 12 — and in elementary school, she had to do code red drills.” This is life for the children of the mass shooting generation. They were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, and grew up practicing active shooter drills and huddling through lockdowns. They talked about threats and safety steps with their parents and teachers. With friends, they wondered darkly whether it could happen at their own school, and who might do it.  Now, this generation is almost grown up. And when a gunman killed 17 people this week at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., the first response of many of their classmates was not to grieve in silence, but to speak out. Their urgent voices — in television interviews, on social media, even from inside a locked school office as they hid from the gunman — are now rising in the national debate over gun violence in the aftermath of yet another school shooting.  While many politicians after the shooting were focused on mental health and safety, some vocal students at Stoneman Douglas High showed no reluctance in drawing attention to gun control. They called out politicians over Twitter, with one student telling Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, “YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND.” Shortly after the shooting, Cameron Kasky, a junior at the school, and a few friends started a “Never Again” campaign on Facebook that shared stories and perspectives from other students who survived the rampage. On a day when the funerals of the shooting victims began here, more than a dozen schools from Massachusetts to Iowa to Michigan were shut down in response to copycat threats and social media interpreted in the worst light. A college near Seattle was on lockdown for several hours on Friday after an unfounded report of gunfire and in at least one case an entire district closed down. Several students have been arrested, accused of phoning in threats to their schools. Just hours after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., students turned to social media to advocate for more gun control. At other high schools across the country, students rallied in solidarity with Stoneman Douglas High and staged walkouts to protest what they called Washington’s inaction in protecting students and teachers. A gun control advocacy group, Moms Demand Action, said it had been so overwhelmed with requests from students that it was setting up a parallel, student focused advocacy group. “People say it’s too early to talk about it,” Mr. Kasky said. “If you ask me, it’s way too late.” His argument reflects the words of other students who want action: The issue is not an abstraction to them. These are their murdered friends, their bloodstained schools, their upended lives. Students said they did not want to cede the discussion over their lives to politicians and adult activists.  “We need to take it into our hands,” Mr. Kasky said. David Hogg, a 17-year-old student journalist who interviewed his classmates during the rampage in Parkland, said he had thought about the possibility of a school shooting long before shots from an AR-15 started to blast through the hallways. As he huddled with fellow students, he stayed calm and decided to try to create a record of their thoughts and views that would live on, even if the worst happened to them.      “I recorded those videos because I didn’t know if I was going to survive,” he said in an interview here. “But I knew that if those videos survived, they would echo on and tell the story. And that story would be one that would change things, I hoped. And that would be my legacy.” It is a stark change from the moments that followed the Columbine shooting in April 1999, said Austin Eubanks, who survived the shooting. Mr. Eubanks and a friend hid under a table when the two teenage gunmen walked into the library and started shooting. Mr. Eubanks was wounded. His friend, Corey DePooter, was killed. “There was nobody who took an activism stance,” Mr. Eubanks said of Columbine’s immediate aftermath. He said he began abusing opiates shortly after as a coping mechanism. “I just wanted to be left alone. I was so destabilized and traumatized.” Mr. Eubanks now helps run an addiction treatment center in Colorado and has sons of his own, aged 8 and 12. The oldest has asked why Columbine happened and whether he needs to be afraid, and Mr. Eubanks said he has tried to make the boys feel safe while also discussing how children can drift toward violence. No matter how rare school shootings are for the vast majority of students, they have grown up in a world so attuned to these threats that high schoolers are now more conversant in the language of lockdowns and code red drills than their parents. Spencer Collier, the police chief in Selma, Ala., was chatting recently with a group of high school students when they brought up mass shootings and pressed him about current trends and what law enforcement agencies were doing to address them. In Connecticut, Nathaniel Laske, a high school junior, said he had asked school administrators about the apparent absence of lockdown drills or a mass shooting plan in the event something happened during school theater productions. “A lot of people aren’t willing to talk about it,” Mr. Laske said. “When you’re part of a school community it makes you much more inclined to want to prevent things.” Soon after Amy Campbell-Oates, 16, heard about the Parkland shooting, she knew she wanted to try, in some small way, to influence the national discussion on gun violence. She and two friends organized a protest, made posters, and on Friday, they rallied with dozens of fellow students from South Broward High School.  They carried signs that read “It Could’ve Been Us,” and “Your Silence is Killing Us,” and “We Stand with Stoneman Douglas.” They chanted, their collective voices rising as cars honked in support. “We agreed that our politicians have to do more than say thoughts and prayers,” Ms. Campbell-Oates said. “We want voters to know that midterms are coming up. Some of us can’t vote yet but we want to get to the people that can to vote in common sense laws, ban assault rifles and require mental health checks before gun purchases.” Tyra Hemans, a senior at Stoneman Douglas High, made a poster, too, emblazoned with the word “ENOUGH.” On Friday, Ms. Hemans attended the funeral for Meadow Pollack, one of the 17 people killed, and then she spoke about her desire to see President Trump when he visits the area. “I want our politicians to stop thinking about money and start thinking about all these lives we have lost,” she said. “I want to talk with him about changing these laws. Seventeen people are dead, killed in minutes.” Audra D. S. Burch reported from Parkland, Fla., Patricia Mazzei from New York and Jack Healy from Denver.

National,48," By JULIE TURKEWITZ and ANEMONA HARTOCOLLISFEB. 20, 2018 For the latest news in the wake of the Florida school shooting, read Wednesday’s coverage. CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. — Driven by rage and grief over one of the deadliest school shootings in modern American history, students from across the country were taking action in hopes of pushing their lawmakers to rethink their positions on gun control, even as the Florida State House rejected a move on Tuesday to consider a bill that would ban assault rifles. From California to Florida, teenagers walked out of classes, stopped traffic and made stirring speeches calling out their elders for inaction. Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed last week, traveled on Tuesday to Tallahassee, the state capital, to call for an assault weapons ban. The direct appeal to the Legislature follows protests outside schools, social media appeals and national television appearances. • Assault rifles have become a particular target of the latest gun-control campaign. The police say the suspect in last week’s massacre, Nikolas Cruz, was able to kill 17 people in just six minutes by wielding a semiautomatic weapon, an AR-15 rifle.  • President Trump on Tuesday ordered the Justice Department to propose regulations to ban so-called bump stocks, which can convert a semiautomatic gun into an automatic weapon like the one used last year in the Las Vegas shooting. Read more on how they work.  • A Washington Post/ABC News opinion poll released on Tuesday showed that 77 percent of Americans believe the Republican-controlled Congress is not doing enough to prevent mass shootings, with 62 percent saying President Trump has not done enough. On Monday, the White House indicated that  Mr. Trump was open to supporting a bipartisan effort to revise federal background checks for prospective gun buyers. • The actor George Clooney and his wife, Amal, said Tuesday that they would donate $500,000 to a nationwide protest against gun violence planned for next month by the Stoneman Douglas High students. The announcement inspired similar gifts from other big-name Hollywood figures, including the producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife, Marilyn, Oprah Winfrey, and Steven Spielberg and his wife, Kate Capshaw. • As of Monday, two survivors of the shooting remained hospitalized in fair condition at Broward Health North, and two others remained in fair condition at Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale. • The Florida shooting has renewed attention on state laws that allow a judge to take away weapons from people who are deemed dangerous, known as “red flag” laws. Some governors have shown a willingness to change their mind on gun restrictions, but other simply dug in on their stances. • In Florida, an AR-15 is easier to buy than a handgun. Read more on how the AR-15 became one of the weapons of choice for mass killers, and the research that tries to explain the high rate of mass shootings in the United States. • Sign up for the Morning Briefing for news and a daily look at what you need to know to begin your day. State Representative Kionne McGhee, a Democrat from Miami, asked for an unusual procedural move to consider his legislation, which had been filed earlier in the session but was never scheduled for a hearing.  “The shooting in Parkland demands extraordinary action,” Mr. McGhee said Tuesday on the House floor, as a different group of Stoneman Douglas High students, who had previously arrived, peered down from the gallery. The motion failed, 36 to 71, in a vote along party lines. At least one student burst into tears, Mr. McGhee said. One girl covered her mouth in despair, as a woman patted her arm to comfort her. The episode lasted 2 minutes and 38 seconds. As the news began to spread aboard a bus of students headed to the capital, Anthony Lopez, 16, a junior, slammed his head back on the bus seat. He placed a hand on his forehead. “That’s infuriating,” he said. “They’re acting inhuman.” “The one fear we have is that nothing will change,” he added. A similar proposal filed last year in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando also went nowhere. Republican leaders in the Legislature have said they would consider more modest proposals, including raising the minimum age to buy assault rifles, before the session ends in March. The Miami Herald reported that legislators in both the Florida House and Senate were also drafting legislation to limit access to semiautomatic rifles, after years of reluctance. That plan would bar people under 21 from possession of an assault rifle, and would require buyers to wait three days before purchasing any kind of rifle. “The House looks forward to working with the Governor and Senate to find solutions to fulfill government’s primary mission — to keep its citizens — its children safe,” said Richard Corcoran, the Republican speaker of the House, in a statement. “And it is our goal to give these collective solutions the serious review and consideration they deserve.” In session later on Tuesday, the House did approve a resolution declaring pornography a public health risk. Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, questioned why the pornography proposal was given priority. Implicit in his question was why the assault weapons ban was not. “Has anyone ever been killed as a result of the health implications of pornography?” he asked. 
            I will be on the bus today with teenage activists from Stoneman Douglas who are driving 7 hours to rally for gun law reform in Tallahassee. Please follow here and @nytimes for live updates. pic.twitter.com/AxaABSdHKl         Buoyed by viral tweets and media interviews, several Stoneman Douglas High students who survived the attack have been vocal about wanting change since the shooting. Their message: We’ve been there. Listen to us.  At first, the students gained notice for their raw, emotional reactions in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. The emotion hasn’t receded, but efforts to channel their grief into legislative change — like 18-year-old Emma González’s appeal for gun laws — have been widely praised. Just hours after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., students turned to social media to advocate for more gun control. On Tuesday, teenagers from the school, gripping pillows and sleeping bags and carrying doughnuts and candy, packed a grocery store parking lot in Coral Springs, Fla., to begin the more than 400-mile journey to Tallahassee. Their goal: convincing lawmakers to pass a slate of gun control bills in a state that has been among the friendliest to firearm owners in the nation. Many had come straight from the funeral of one of the dead. They hugged their parents goodbye and loaded backpacks into the bellies of three buses. Dozens climbed aboard. In a telephone interview from the bus, Sarah Chadwick, 16, a junior, said the social media response to the students had been overwhelming, but she wanted everyone to know: “We see your support, we see what you’re doing.” The students felt they had the “best voices to listen to right now,” along with other survivors of shootings, and that Twitter had allowed them to reach more people than they would have thought possible, she said. “We have stuff to say, and we won’t be silenced after a matter of days, or even weeks,” she said. 
            TALLAHASSEE BOUND pic.twitter.com/C5855UYNpo         By the seventh hour of the trip, students on the bus had become aware of Mr. Clooney’s donation and the supportive remarks made by other celebrities.  But as they strategized in the back of the bus, some worried that Mr. Clooney’s star power and liberal activism would swallow their voices and push conservatives away. “The minute they don’t see our faces anymore, and they just see the Hollywood elite, they’re going to stop taking it seriously,” said Chris Grady, 18, a senior with a mop of curly hair. Mr. Grady said he had enlisted in the Army a few months back, but that the attack at his school had made him think hard about whether that was the path he wanted to take. “As it stands right now, the real danger is at home, not abroad,” he said. “So this is where I want to be — right at the heart of the movement.” “I wasn’t sure what I wanted to study,” he continued. “And now for sure I’ll be getting my degree in political science.” Finally, around 10 p.m., the three buses of students from Stoneman Douglas High rolled into the parking lot of a Tallahassee high school. They had arrived. One hundred Marjory Stoneman Douglas students traveled to Tallahassee to advocate for gun control. Survivors spoke to legislators while supporters protested across the country. “Oh. My. God,” said one teenager, peering out the bus window. “It’s so many people.” A crowd of people from Leon High had gathered in front of the red brick building to support and cheer the Stoneman Douglas group. In the morning, the students will break into groups and meet with some 70 elected officials. Gov. Rick Scott is expected to give them two hours.  Mallory Muller, a Stoneman Douglas High student, hugged a teddy bear to her chest. “The whole bus ride here I was very anxious,” she said. “You have the nervousness about — what happens? And kind of scared for your own safety.” “We know what we’re doing tomorrow is big,” she went on, “so I think there is that buildup tomorrow, too. That pressure.” Before marching south toward Stoneman Douglas High, dozens of students from West Boca Raton High School first gathered in the courtyard of their school for a peaceful protest — 17 minutes of silence for the 17 victims — but then someone opened a door and walked out, and others followed, a videotape of the scene aired by WPTV showed. “Everybody started walking,” one student told the news channel. “It felt like half the school was walking.” As the students walked south on U.S. Highway 441, sheriff’s deputies lined the road to direct traffic and keep them safe, but did not interfere. The distance between the two schools is about 10 miles. The march from Boca Raton surprised Broward County officials, who said they had heard nothing about the protest. Todd DeAngelis, a spokesman for the city of Parkland, said the authorities abruptly assembled an escort by law enforcement and organized water stations on a day when the temperature was in the low 80s. In a rare honor, the United States Military Academy offered the member, Peter Wang, 15, the realization of a lifelong dream: admission to West Point, posthumously. The academy said it was extending the offer in recognition of his “heroic actions” during the shooting. Mr. Wang was last seen holding a door open at Stoneman Douglas High so that others could escape, Ernie Rospierski, a teacher who survived, told CBS News.  Relatives of Mr. Wang, a cadet in the school’s Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, described him as modest and not interested in status, but eager to serve and help others. At his funeral on Tuesday, the military mourners acknowledged him as one of them. They came in echoes of the uniform that he had once proudly worn: Marine and Navy dress blues, high school R.O.T.C. members in their dress uniforms, others wearing camouflage fatigues. Veterans were in attendance, as well. “We came down to represent,” said Jeff Colopy, vice commander of American Legion Post 157 in Margate, Fla., to “pay tribute to one of our fallen comrades. In our eyes, he was military.” Lying in an open coffin in the small chapel at Kraeer Funeral Home and Cremation Center in Coral Springs, with a military honor guard at either end, Mr. Wang wore his uniform. A line of mourners stretched out of the chapel, with scores more waiting under a tent outside. Mr. Wang was one of three Junior R.O.T.C. cadets who were killed in the shooting; the others were Martin Duque, 14, and Alaina Petty, also 14. The shooting suspect, Mr. Cruz, had also been a member of his school’s Army Junior R.O.T.C., and had “excelled” in air rifle marksmanship contests with other schools in the area in a program that was supported by a grant from the National Rifle Association Foundation, according to The Associated Press. He was wearing his maroon Junior R.O.T.C. emblem polo shirt when he was arrested after the shooting, The A.P. reported. “We all have those shirts,” Angelyse Perez, an 18-year-old senior and a company commander, told The Washington Post. “We’re never wearing them again. We’re going to destroy them all.” At rallies across the country on Monday and Tuesday, students made pleas for gun control and declared that while they might not be old enough to vote, they were old enough to change society.  A crowd of students stood on the steps of the squat, red brick public library in Toms River, N.J., on Monday, a school holiday, to express their solidarity with the fallen Parkland students and teachers. In Chicago, students from the South Side, where gun violence has been a problem, began organizing to demand gun control legislation. In Battle Creek, Mich., dozens of students walked out of Harper Creek High School on Tuesday to protest gun violence in schools. And in Bakersfield, Calif., about a dozen students and 80 adults joined a protest on Monday. “Listening to how worried my mother was dropping me off Friday morning after the shooting was one of the worst things I’ve had to listen to in a while,” Lucy Brown, a member of the Bakersfield High School Young Democrats Club who helped organize the protests, told bakersfield.com. The Florida shooting has renewed attention on state laws that allow a judge to remove weapons from people deemed dangerous, known as “red flag” laws. The measures are frequently supported by Democrats, but opposed by many Republicans and gun rights advocates. State Representative Arthur O’Neill, a Republican from Connecticut, one of only five states to have such laws, has said he would write to legislative leaders in other states to urge them to adopt similar laws. “Unfortunately, this law is not as widely known as it should be,” Mr. O’Neill said last week in a statement. In Pennsylvania, State Senator Daylin Leach on Tuesday announced that he was proposing red flag legislation. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     “Frequently, when there are mass shootings, we see stories about how the shooter made threats, posted on social media, and did all kinds of things showing that he was a danger to the community, yet nothing was done,” said Mr. Leach, a Democrat, in a statement. “My new bill would allow a judge to separate dangerous people from their guns until they get the help they need.”  Similar bills have been proposed this year in other states, including Hawaii and Illinois. The N.R.A. has often spoken against red flag legislation, saying the judges’ orders can infringe on a person’s Second Amendment rights when no crime has been committed. In Vermont, a progressive but rural state with largely permissive gun laws, Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, initially told reporters the state’s gun laws did not need to be updated after the Florida shooting, according to news reports. But Mr. Scott changed his tone a day later, after the authorities accused an 18-year-old student of planning an attack at his school in Fair Haven, Vt. “We must determine if we are truly doing all we can to prevent violence,” Mr. Scott said, and asked legislative leaders to identify policy changes and have “an open conversation about gun safety.” In Ohio, Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who has previously touted support from the N.R.A., made an impassioned plea for Congress to consider restrictions on assault weapons. “Would you feel as though your Second Amendment rights would be eroded because you couldn’t buy a God darn AR-15?” Mr. Kasich, who voted for an assault weapons ban in 1994 while in Congress, asked on CNN. “These are the things that have to be looked at.” In Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, repeated a position he took in late January after a 15-year-old shot and killed two fellow students at a high school in Benton, Ky. Mr. Bevin suggested in an interview with The Cincinnati Enquirer that it was violent video games and culture, rather than guns, that should be restricted. In Rhode Island, Gina Raimondo, the Democratic governor, reiterated calls for stronger state and federal measures. “We need to outlaw military-style assault weapons like our neighbors have in Massachusetts and Connecticut,” Ms. Raimondo told The Providence Journal, also calling for a ban on high-capacity magazines. And in Idaho, according to The Statesman, Gov. C.L. Otter, a Republican, suggested there was little more the state could do to prevent school shootings. “I think we’ve done what we can do,” he said.

National,49," Supported by By Matthew Haag The brother of Nikolas Cruz, who is accused of killing 17 people last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., was arrested on a trespassing charge at the school on Monday afternoon, the authorities said. Deputies with the Broward County Sheriff’s Office stopped the brother, Zachary Cruz, at about 4:30 p.m. after he rode a skateboard onto school property. Mr. Cruz, 18, told the deputies that he decided to visit the school to “reflect on the school shooting and to soak it in,” according to the sheriff’s office. Mr. Cruz was arrested on one count of trespassing on the grounds or facility of a school, a misdemeanor. The sheriff’s office said that school officials had ordered Mr. Cruz to stay away from Stoneman Douglas High. It was not immediately clear when Mr. Cruz had received those warnings. On Monday night, Mr. Cruz was being held with bail set at $25 in the same Broward County jail where his brother, who faces 17 counts of premeditated murder, is being held without bond. Broward County Public Schools did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday night. It was not clear whether Mr. Cruz had a lawyer yet. Zachary Cruz, who, like his brother, was adopted, had a strained relationship with him. Mr. Cruz has lived with a guardian since his mother’s death in November 2017. Two days after the school shooting, he told deputies from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office that he regretted that he and his friends had bullied his older brother. “Zachary wishes that he had been ‘nicer’ to his brother,” the deputies’ report said, adding that Nikolas “may have been the favored brother.” He also told the authorities that he felt as if “someone was trying to get me” and that he was upset about media coverage of the shooting. He said he was “scared as he thought he had heard people outside,” the sheriff’s report said. “Zachary stated that he does feel somewhat responsible and guilty about the incident and that he could have possibly prevented this,” the report continued.

Insider,50," By PATRICIA MAZZEIAPRIL 5, 2018 MIAMI — Inside the computer lab at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last month, students worked furiously on their yearbook, their overlapping conversations moving so briskly that sometimes it was difficult to keep up. But listening closely, I found some of their chatter to be jarring. One moment, two students were engaged in a lighthearted thumb war. The next, two other students mentioned — casually, almost in passing — how many death threats they had received on Twitter. “The ‘block’ button is great,” said Aly Sheehy, an 18-year-old senior. Aly and her classmates were dealing with their new, inescapable reality as survivors of one the deadliest school shootings in modern American history. And I, a reporter returning home to cover its aftermath, was learning that the first few months of my new job would be consumed with stories of lost innocence. I became Miami bureau chief for The New York Times in December, after a decade at The Miami Herald. To get acquainted with my new colleagues and newsroom rhythms, the National editor, Marc Lacey, asked me to spend some time in New York. (Note to self: In the future, refuse to leave Florida in winter.)  I was still in New York on Valentine’s Day when someone flagged me about reports of an active shooter at Stoneman Douglas. They must be mistaken, I thought. Years ago, I covered the Broward County school district for The Herald. Stoneman Douglas was — and still is — a jewel in the Broward public school system, the sixth largest in the country.  I wanted to fly to South Florida as soon as possible. But I was helping to report in New York, and it took me 10 days to get back. Once here, with no assignment or story in mind, I drove to Parkland. I needed to see the school for myself. Standing alone next to the vast, improvised memorial outside its gates, I felt overcome with sadness. I rushed to my car and cried. In late February, the photographer Sam Hodgson pitched spending some time with Sarah Lerner, the yearbook adviser, and her staff. I thought the idea was brilliant, and I was grateful that Ms. Lerner, her students and school administrators would let us in to report. I worried about how the students would react to us. But I had forgotten, in my years since covering education, how easily young people get used to having a reporter around. How often they speak truths that older people might hesitate to say out loud. How incisive their reflections and observations can be. Sam and I tried to be unobtrusive, letting the students work while we hung back and watched and listened. But the computer lab was small, and we were unavoidable. Still, the students said they appreciated that we tried to blend in. They did not mince words when they shared their grievances about other journalists since the shooting. Throngs of reporters crowded the sidewalk on the day the school reopened, clamoring for a sound bite. Kyra Parrow, an 18-year-old senior, chided that reporters “always ask the same questions.” At one point, I started talking with Isabel Chequer, a 16-year-old junior who was painstakingly reviewing group photos for student clubs and identifying each person pictured. To my surprise, she called the task “kind of relaxing.” “It’s just such a good distraction for everything going on,” she said. Isabel explained a few minutes later that she had been injured in the shooting. I didn’t know this; the names of the wounded had not yet been made public, and she had not shared her story with any reporter. But there, side by side in the yearbook lab, she recounted her horrifying experience, with the remarkable poise that has characterized so many of the Parkland students.  “It’s kind of been overwhelming. I’m kind of closed off in talking about my emotions,” Isabel said. “I’ll never be over the grief.” But she expressed hope about the future: that a story of loss might turn into one of recovery and action. “I really think we’re going to do something,” she said. “We’re going to change the world forever.” A version of this article appears in print on April 6, 2018, on Page A2 of the New York edition with the headline: Returning Home to Cover a Tragedy.

Washington,51," By MICHAEL D. SHEARMARCH 24, 2018 On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets in Washington and cities across the globe to take a stance against gun violence. WASHINGTON — Standing before vast crowds from Washington to Los Angeles to Parkland, Fla., the speakers — nearly all of them students, some still in elementary school — delivered an anguished and defiant message: They are “done hiding” from gun violence, and will “stop at nothing” to get politicians to finally prevent it. The students, as they seized the nation’s attention on Saturday with raised fists and tear-streaked faces, vowed that their grief about school shootings and their frustration with adults’ inaction would power a new generation of political activism. “If they continue to ignore us, to only pretend to listen, then we will take action where it counts,” Delaney Tarr, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, where a gunman killed 17 people last month, told tens of thousands rallying in Washington. “We will take action every day in every way until they simply cannot ignore us any more.” For many of the young people, the Washington rally, called March for Our Lives, was their first act of protest and the beginning of a political awakening. But that awakening may be a rude one — lawmakers in Congress have largely disregarded their pleas for action on television and social media in the five weeks since the Parkland shooting.  That reality helped drive the Parkland survivors in Washington, as they led a crowd that filled blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and Capitol Hill. Thousands more rallied at about 800 “sibling” marches around the country and abroad, where students, like those in the capital, made eloquent calls for gun control and pledged to exercise their newfound political power in the midterm elections this fall.  Aerial video captured seas of people — in front of Trump International Hotel in New York; in a central square in Tokyo; along the streets of Boston; at a rally in downtown Fort Worth, Tex.; and crammed into a park less than a mile from Stoneman Douglas High. Delivered in soaring speeches, emotional chants and hand-painted signs, the protesters’ messages offered angry rebukes to the National Rifle Association and politicians who have left gun laws largely intact for decades. A sign in Washington declared “Graduations, not funerals!” while another in New York said “I should be learning, not protesting.” Crowds in Chicago chanted “Fear has no place in our schools” as they marched. Celebrities, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, the “Hamilton” star, and the pop singers Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus, performed in Washington, where politicians and adult activists were largely sidelined in favor of the fresh-faced students offering stories of fear and frustration, but also hope for change. The most powerful, and impassioned, moments came from the surviving students of the Parkland shooting, who declared themselves angry, impatient and determined to stop the slaughter. “Today, we march,” Ms. Tarr said. “We fight. We roar. We prepare our signs. We raise them high. We know what we want, we know how to get it and we are not waiting any more.” An 11-year-old girl from Virginia, Naomi Wadler, captivated her audience as she declared “Never again!” on behalf of black women and girls who have been the victims of gun violence. Calls like Naomi’s stood in stark contrast to action on Capitol Hill and at the White House in the hours before the rallies. President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that took no significant new steps on gun control: It did nothing to expand background checks, impose additional limits on assault weapons, require a higher age for rifle purchases or curb the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines.  The spending legislation, which was viewed as the last opportunity this year for Congress to enact major new gun restrictions before the midterm elections in November, included only some school safety measures and modest improvements to the background check system. Organizers at national gun control groups, who provided logistical support and public relations advice as the students planned the Washington rally, said they believed that the students would not become disillusioned by the lack of immediate action in Congress. They noted that rallies took place in 390 of the country’s 435 congressional districts. “The mass shooting generation is nearing voting age,” said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a national group that advocates tougher gun laws. “They know the midterms are six months away, and they plan to make sure that they vote and they get others to register to vote. They are absolutely poised to turn this moment into a movement.” Gun rights organizations largely stayed silent on Saturday, following vigorous efforts since the Parkland shooting to squash any movement toward significant gun control legislation. A spokesman for the N.R.A. declined repeated requests for comment. On the eve of the march, Colion Noir, a host on NRATV, an online video channel produced by the gun group, lashed out at the Parkland students, saying that “no one would know your names” if someone with a weapon had stopped the gunman at their school. “These kids ought to be marching against their own hypocritical belief structures,” he said in the video, adding: “The only reason we’ve ever heard of them is because the guns didn’t come soon enough.” Small counterprotests took place in a few cities. In Salt Lake City, several hundred people gathered near a high school, some carrying signs with messages like “AR-15’s EMPOWER the people.” Brandon McKee, who wore a pistol on his belt, brought his daughter, Kendall, 11, who held a sign that said “Criminals love gun control.” “I believe it’s their goal to unarm America, and that’s why we’re here today,” Mr. McKee said of the Washington marchers. In Boston, about 20 protesters favoring gun control confronted a small clutch of Second Amendment supporters in front of the State House. The two sides quickly got into a shouting match. 
                Crowds gathered in cities across the United States and around the world.             The pro-gun protests were swamped in size and enthusiasm by those marching for gun control, many of whom traveled for many hours to attend the rallies in cities across the country. Sebastian Jennings, 18, said he spent 36 hours taking a bus to Washington from western Arkansas. Tour buses lined the streets.  Security was tight in Washington, where military trucks and guards blocked almost every intersection near the rally amid a huge police presence, and in other cities where marches and rallies forced the closing of major roads. In towns like Dahlonega, Ga., smaller rallies sought to demonstrate a desire for new gun restrictions even in rural, Republican-leaning communities where gun ownership is common and support for the Second Amendment is strong.      “We’re going to be the generation that takes down the gun lobby,” Marisa Pyle, 20, said through a red megaphone to a group of several hundred people gathered in front of the Dahlonega Gold Museum. Around the world, Americans living abroad gathered to honor those who have died in school shootings and to echo the call for gun control. Protesters in Rome jammed the sidewalk across from the American Embassy, next to the upscale Via Veneto, raising their voice in chants — “Hey hey, ho ho, the N.R.A. has got to go,” and waving signs with messages like “A gun is not fun” and “Am I next?” many made by high school students at an international school. About 150 to 200 people in Berlin gathered in solidarity in front of the Brandenburg Gate, just steps from the American Embassy. Many carried hand-painted signs, among them: “Arms should be for hugging,” “Bullets aren’t school supplies” and “Waffeln statt Waffen” (Waffles instead of weapons). One of the largest rallies outside Washington was at a Florida park not far from Stoneman Douglas High School. During that event, 17 students from the school silently took the stage to represent their friends who had been killed. Anthony Montalto, the brother of Gina Rose Montalto, one of those killed, held a sign that said: “My sister could not make it here today. I’m here for her.”  “Turn this moment into a movement,” Sari Kaufman, a sophomore at Stoneman Douglas, implored the sea of students, parents and teachers. She urged her classmates to vote out of office politicians who receive money from the N.R.A. “They think we’re all talk and no action.” Witness the thousands who have gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington to protest gun violence, in 360-degree video. But the largest rally, by far, was in Washington, where stage risers and giant television monitors were set up in the shadow of the Capitol — the focus of much of the anger from students throughout the day. One protester carried a sign that said “If the opposite of pro is con, then the opposite of progress is Congress.” Most Republican and Democratic members of Congress had already left the city to return to their home districts for spring break. Mr. Trump spent Saturday afternoon in Florida, at the Trump International Golf Club, less than an hour north of Parkland. A White House spokeswoman said in a statement, “We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today.” City officials had prepared for the biggest march since about a half-million women gathered on the day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, declaring a new political movement aimed at resisting the president and his policies. On Saturday, officials with Metro, the region’s subway system, said more than 207,000 rides had been taken on the system by 1 p.m., about half of the number by that time during the Women’s March. A team of crowd science researchers led by G. Keith Still of Manchester Metropolitan University in England estimated that about 180,000 people attended the rally. They examined photographs, video and satellite imagery to estimate the crowd density in different areas of the demonstration. The number is less than half of the 470,000 that Dr. Still estimated had attended the Women’s March in Washington in 2017. Even so, the streets of Washington were packed on Saturday. Teenagers climbed on each other’s shoulders to reach the bare limbs of trees, where they climbed higher. And each student who spoke drew a cheer that matched, and even eclipsed, the applause given to the musical performers.  Edna Chavez, 17, a high school senior from Los Angeles, said she had lost her brother to gun violence: “He was in high school when he passed away. It was a day like any other day. Sunset down on South Central. You hear pops, thinking they’re fireworks.” “Ricardo was his name. Can you all say it with me?” she asked. The crowd said his name over and over again, as Ms. Chavez smiled through tears. Naomi Wadler, the 11-year-old student, introduced herself with a soft “hi” and said she represented the black women who have been victims of gun violence. “People have said that I am too young to have these thoughts on my own,” she said. “People have said that I am a tool of some nameless adult. It’s not true. My friends and I might still be 11, and we might still be in elementary school, but we know.” She added, “And we know that we have seven short years until we, too, have the right to vote.” Reporting was contributed by Emily Baumgaertner, Emily Cochrane, Sabrina Tavernise, Patricia Mazzei and Noah Weiland from Washington; Jill Burke from Anchorage; Jeff Mays, Annie Correal, Jacey Fortin and Jonathan Wolfe from New York; Alan Blinder from Dahlonega, Ga.; Mitch Smith from Chicago; Julie Turkewitz from Salt Lake City; Nick Madigan from Parkland, Fla.; Jose Del Real from Los Angeles; Jess Bidgood from Montpelier, Vt.; Mark Landler from Palm Beach, Fla.; Christopher Schuetze from Berlin; Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome; and Hisako Ueno from Tokyo.

National,52," By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS and PATRICIA MAZZEIMARCH 20, 2018 Five minutes before her close friend Lynda Cruz died last November, Rocxanne Deschamps stood by her hospital bed and promised to take care of Ms. Cruz’s two boys, who were also there to say their goodbyes. Then she moved the brothers into the mobile home park where she was living in South Florida. One of them, Nikolas Cruz, would be out of the home in less than a month. Ms. Deschamps said on Tuesday that she had called 911 on him three times — once after finding a receipt for a gun and bullets in Mr. Cruz’s room, again after finding an empty gun box, and the third time after he punched holes in the wall and got into a fight with her son. Finally, she gave Mr. Cruz an ultimatum: lose the guns, or leave the home. He chose the latter. “I did everything I could to warn law enforcement about what could happen,” Ms. Deschamps, 42, said on Tuesday, the first public account she has given since the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in which Mr. Cruz is accused of killing 17 people in one of the worst school shootings in American history. “I wanted to protect not only my own children, but also anyone else who might be at risk of being harmed,” she said. “I also wanted to protect Nikolas from himself.”  The shooting on Feb. 14 touched off nationwide student protests calling for firearms restrictions, including marches planned on Saturday in Washington and other cities. It also has led to questions about whether the authorities missed opportunities to avert the massacre. Ms. Deschamps’s phone calls to 911 were just some of the calls and tips alerting law enforcement that Mr. Cruz, 19, was unstable and armed.  Ms. Deschamps spoke on the same day that a judge in Florida set a $500,000 bond for Mr. Cruz’s younger brother, Zachary, who was charged with trespassing, accused of skateboarding through the Stoneman Douglas High schoolyard after school let out on Monday. It was the third time Zachary Cruz, 18, had visited the school since the shooting, said the prosecutor, Sarahnell Murphy. He was booked into the same jail where his brother is being held. Ms. Murphy said Mr. Cruz has visited his brother in jail since the Feb. 14 shooting, “where he has been heard and observed discussing how popular his brother is now, that his face is everywhere and his name is national.” “There is discussion about starting some sort of pen pal or fan club,” Ms. Murphy said. “And about how many girls he is capable of attracting.” Judge Kim Theresa Mollica of Broward County Court ordered Zachary Cruz, once he is released, to wear an ankle monitor and to stay away from all schools, and she barred him from visiting his brother in jail. Mr. Cruz, in shackles and a jumpsuit, appeared by remote video link at the hearing and did not speak. His lawyer, Joseph Kimok, called the bond and the judge’s restrictions on his movement “entirely disproportionate.” “He is being held because of who he is related to, not because of anything he did,” Mr. Kimok said.  The high school, whose students have become leaders in the student gun control movement, continues to reel from the tragedy. On Tuesday alone, three students were arrested: one who was accused of posting threatening messages on Snapchat, and two who were accused of bringing knives to school, according to the Broward Sheriff’s Office. A deputy stationed at the school, meanwhile, was suspended after a student reported seeing him sleeping on duty the day before. And Gov. Rick Scott offered to send state troopers to ensure that every entry point on campus was guarded. Ms. Deschamps, whose phone calls to 911 had previously been disclosed through public records releases, made her first public appearance at a news conference in Manhattan with Gloria Allred, the lawyer known for representing women in sexual harassment cases.      Ms. Deschamps read a prepared statement, and Ms. Allred did not allow her to answer questions. Ms. Allred said that Ms. Deschamps was speaking out because she believed that “the system failed the victims of the Parkland tragedy, even though she did everything she could do to prevent it.” She added: “Rocxanne reached out to me because she is concerned that there were many false statements made about her, and she wanted to share her truth about what really happened.” Ms. Allred did not elaborate. Ms. Deschamps said she got to know the Cruz family when they were neighbors in Parkland. Ms. Deschamps said she first noticed Mr. Cruz’s fascination with guns — and that his mother was afraid of him — when she stayed with Ms. Cruz, whose husband died of heart disease in 2004, for three weeks in October 2016. Ms. Cruz died of pneumonia at age 68 in November. Ms. Deschamps said that before Nikolas moved in, she told him that he could not bring any guns into her house, except BB guns, and that those were to be locked in the room of her adult son, Rock. At first Mr. Cruz was on his best behavior, Ms. Deschamps said. But then her mother, who was living with them, found a receipt in Mr. Cruz’s room for a gun and bullets from Dick’s Sporting Goods. They did not find the gun, because it was still in the mandatory waiting period. But her son, Rock, called 911 nonetheless and asked if Nikolas could be stopped from receiving the gun. “They said they couldn’t stop him from buying or having possession of a gun,” Ms. Deschamps said. “I told them that Nikolas was 19 years old, but he felt mentally and emotionally as similar as a 12-year-old.”  After the Parkland shooting, Florida raised the minimum age to buy a firearm to 21. She made the second call to 911 after her mother saw Mr. Cruz digging a hole in the backyard. They found a large empty gun box the same size as the hole, she said. They called 911 and explained to the officer that “we were afraid of his intentions,” Ms. Deschamps said. “The police said that anyone was allowed to bury a gun, and that Nikolas was allowed to do that,” she said. The third call occurred after Nikolas had been punching holes in the wall and her son interceded, saying “he must not disrespect me and not destroy our home.” Nikolas punched her son, she said, “and Rock defended himself.” She called 911, but Nikolas fled the house before the police arrived. She told the police about previous incidents in which Nikolas had put a gun to his mother’s head and his brother’s head. “Law enforcement said that nothing could be done,” she said. When Mr. Cruz returned to the house, Ms. Deschamps said, she told him he had to choose between them or the gun. “He chose the gun,” she said. She offered to help find Mr. Cruz a place. He went to a friend’s house for a short while, and then to a schoolmate’s house, where he was living when the shooting occurred. “Unfortunately,” Ms. Deschamps said, “although I did everything I could, I was not able to stop this tragedy from taking place.” Alain Delaquérière contributed research.

National,53," By PATRICIA MAZZEIMARCH 18, 2018 MIAMI — On the day an 11th grader named Nikolas Cruz told another student that he had a gun at home and was thinking of using it, two guidance counselors and a sheriff’s deputy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., concluded that he should be forcibly committed for psychiatric evaluation, according to mental health records obtained on Sunday by The New York Times. An involuntary commitment of that kind, under the authority of a Florida state law known as the Baker Act, could have kept Mr. Cruz from passing a background check required to buy a firearm. But Mr. Cruz appears never to have been institutionalized despite making threats to himself and others, cutting his arms with a pencil sharpener and claiming he had drunk gasoline in a possible attempt to kill himself, all in a five-day period in September 2016. The revelation that school officials considered trying to commit Mr. Cruz under the Baker Act in 2016 appeared to be another in a string of missed opportunities to deal with the troubled young man. He went on to commit one of the deadliest school massacres in American history last month, killing 17 people and wounding 17 more using a gun he bought legally.  A Florida social services agency investigated Mr. Cruz after it was alerted about the same disturbing behavior in 2016, but it determined that he was at low risk of harming himself or others. Local sheriffs’ deputies were repeatedly called to Mr. Cruz’s residences but never found reason enough to arrest him. And the F.B.I. failed to investigate tips about Mr. Cruz’s apparent interest in shooting up a school, even after a woman called to say that Mr. Cruz had weapons and was “going to explode.”  At the time when school officials said they would initiate Baker Act commitment proceedings against Mr. Cruz, he apparently did not own any weapon other than a pellet gun. But five months later, after being kicked out of Stoneman Douglas High, he legally purchased the semiautomatic AR-15 rifle that he used to open fire on Feb. 14 in the school’s freshman building. The mental health records, first reported by The Sun Sentinel of South Florida and The Associated Press, form part of the criminal case against Mr. Cruz, 19, who has been charged with murder and attempted murder in a 34-count indictment. Prosecutors have said they would seek the death penalty if he is convicted. The records are from Henderson Behavioral Health, a local clinic that school officials called for help dealing with Mr. Cruz. The clinic sent a mobile assistance team to Stoneman Douglas High on Sept. 28, 2016, the records show, because Mr. Cruz had made threats and exhibited disturbing behavior following a breakup with a girlfriend. Mr. Cruz was also said to be upset that his mother, Lynda Cruz, would not let him get an identification card required to buy a gun. He wrote “kill” in a notebook in anger over her refusal, he told a counselor. Mr. Cruz denied telling another student that he wanted to use a gun or that he had ingested gasoline, the documents say. He also said he would not hurt his mother. Five days earlier, on Sept. 23, the day before Mr. Cruz turned 18, Ms. Cruz had summoned a different Henderson clinician to her home because Mr. Cruz was verbally aggressive and “punching holes in the wall.” The clinician who wrote the Sept. 28 report concluded that Mr. Cruz “did not meet criteria for further assessment.” The sheriff’s deputy at the school, Scot Peterson, told a clinician that he wanted to initiate a Baker Act request against Mr. Cruz anyway, the records show, and two school counselors agreed. Under the law, he could have been held for at least three days of evaluation. Deputy Peterson also said he would search Mr. Cruz’s home for a gun. And the Florida Department of Children and Families was called in to investigate.  But while the sheriff’s office did visit the Cruz home, Deputy Peterson apparently changed his mind about the commitment request the next day. One of the guidance counselors told the Henderson clinic that the deputy had decided Mr. Cruz did not fit the criteria for involuntary commitment. Clinicians had repeatedly concluded that the Baker Act would not justify committing Mr. Cruz because he denied having an intent or a plan to hurt himself or others. Deputy Peterson was still serving as the school resource officer at Stoneman Douglas High when Mr. Cruz carried out his deadly rampage. Surveillance video showed that the deputy remained outside the freshman building during the shooting and did not try to confront Mr. Cruz, in apparent violation of the Broward County Sheriff’s Office policy for dealing with active shooters. Mr. Peterson resigned and retired after the sheriff, Scott Israel, placed him under internal investigation.      An attorney for Mr. Peterson, Joseph A. DiRuzzo III, has said that Mr. Peterson did not enter the building because he believed initially that the gunfire was coming from outside. Mr. DiRuzzo did not immediately respond on Sunday to questions about Mr. Peterson’s decision in 2016 not to pursue a Baker Act commitment of Mr. Cruz. A new law passed by state legislators and signed by Gov. Rick Scott earlier this month will give the police more power under the Baker Act to confiscate guns. It will also allow the police, with judicial approval, to prohibit a person who is deemed dangerous from owning guns for up to a year. Mental health records from earlier years, before Henderson therapists treated Mr. Cruz, show that a psychiatrist recommended sending him to a residential treatment facility in 2013, when he was 15 years old. That was the year he learned that he and his younger brother, Zachary, were adopted. According to the records, his mother said he had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder. An evaluation from Cross Creek, an alternative school where Nikolas Cruz was sent in 2014, when he was in eighth grade, concluded he was “often moody, impulsive, angry, attention seeking, annoys others on purpose and threatens to hurt others.” The records indicate that his mother said his behavior worsened after he found his father, Roger, dead at home in 2004. Ms. Cruz told the Cross Creek school that she had found knives and scissors in his bed, which she assumed he kept there to defend himself against his brother. The two boys had a “strained” relationship, according to the Cross Creek report.  Zachary Cruz has lived with a guardian since Ms. Cruz’s death in November 2017. He told deputies from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office two days after the shooting last month that he regretted that he and his friends had bullied his older brother. “Zachary wishes that he had been ‘nicer’ to his brother,” the deputies’ report said, adding that Nikolas “may have been the favored brother.” Nikolas Cruz moved to Stoneman Douglas High full time for his junior year, but he started having trouble almost immediately. According to the records, on Sept. 29, 2016, the day after the Henderson team was called to the school, a clinician visited the Cruz home in Parkland and went over Mr. Cruz’s comments about guns. Ms. Cruz responded that she did not worry about her son’s use of firearms. “I’m not concerned and I’m not afraid,” she told the clinician, the Henderson records say. “My son has pellet guns, and he’s always respected the rules of where they can and can’t be used.” Unable or unwilling to try to forcibly commit Mr. Cruz, the school drafted a safety plan that prohibited him from bringing a backpack to school. He was also barred from practicing shooting skills with the Junior R.O.T.C. organization at the school, which he had joined. In November 2016, Mr. Cruz refused any more special education assistance in school, as was his right since he had turned 18, and his mother agreed, according to Robert W. Runcie, superintendent of the Broward County Public Schools. Mr. Cruz’s behavior deteriorated over the following months until Feb. 8, 2017, when he was transferred to an alternative learning center. Three days later, Mr. Cruz purchased the AR-15 rifle. Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.

National,54," By JACK HEALYFEB. 28, 2018 PARKLAND, Fla. — Brooke Harrison, 14, was still in a deep sleep when her mother knocked on her door and hugged her awake at 6:45 Wednesday morning. “You need to get up,” she told her daughter. “You don’t want to be late for school today.” It was the first day of class for Brooke and her classmates at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School since a mass shooting that killed 17 people and forever upended thousands of lives across this South Florida suburb two weeks ago. It had been two weeks of nightmares, funerals, flashbacks, vigils and grief counseling since the attack. But Brooke felt ready. She had watched gunfire explode through her Honors English class that Feb. 14 afternoon as she and her classmates worked on an essay about hardship and education. Three students from her class alone were killed. She had heard their last breaths, crawled through glass and put pressure on a wounded student’s torso before escaping through the school parking lot and running as fast as she could to reach her home in a subdivision lined by coconut palms.  Now, like many other Stoneman Douglas students, Brooke just wanted to return to a routine. She wanted to see her friends and reclaim her school, which is ringed by police officers and garlanded by fading memorial flowers.  She was nervous, and she worried she would cry when she walked through the courtyard where she would sometimes eat lunch with Alaina Petty, who was killed in her classroom. Others said they dreaded confronting so many empty seats, or seeing the art project that a slain friend would never finish. “I just hope she’s going to be O.K. being there all day,” Brooke’s mother, Denise, said as she made coffee, toast and bacon for breakfast. “That it’s not traumatic to be there.” But first, Brooke needed her mother to help unknot a pair of gray Nikes. “I have no strength,” she said as she walked into the kitchen, smiling and still wearing the same burgundy Stoneman Douglas shirt from the day before. The bloodied shoes that Brooke had worn the day of the shooting had been taken away as evidence. Her favorite sweater was also seized. Her black backpack now has a bullet hole in the bottom, from one of the AR-15 rifle rounds that filled her English class with a choking haze and killed Alex Schachter, Alyssa Alhadeff and Alaina before her eyes there in room 1216. So on Wednesday, Brooke went back to school carrying little more than her phone and a small bracelet made by students that said “ALAINA.” The shortened school day started with fourth period, the class where everything had shattered. For 30 minutes, the students reunited with the classmates and teachers who had huddled with them in closets and corners. They spent 24 minutes in each of their other classes and were done by 11:40 a.m. Robert W. Runcie, the Broward schools superintendent, said about 95 percent of the student body of 3,293 had returned. There were extra counselors and therapy dogs on hand, and it will be days — if not weeks — before students return to their regular lessons. The school’s principal, Ty Thompson, said on Twitter that the focus of the week would be on healing, and classes are being dismissed at 11:40 a.m. for the rest of the week in an effort to let the students acclimate to being back.  “There is no need for backpacks,” he wrote. “Come ready to start the healing process and #RECLAIM THE NEST.”      Back at home that morning, it was 7:23. Time for Brooke to go. “Are we ready?” Ms. Harrison asked. “Yeah.” As they skimmed through the neighborhood in a white Hyundai S.U.V., past driveway basketball hoops, cyclists and joggers, Ms. Harrison remembered how she had driven the same route two weeks earlier to find Brooke after the shooting. Many parents had exchanged frantic text messages with their children as they hid in their classrooms, but Brooke’s class was one of the first to be attacked. When she and her friends poured out of the school, they grabbed cellphones from strangers and broke the news to their parents. Brooke’s mother found her shaken near their subdivision. That day, Brooke and two friends had sat at her house and feverishly tried to confirm which of their friends was safe. They sent group text messages asking who was missing and who had been found. They posted photos on social media. They knew, before any names were officially released or parents were notified, which of their friends were not coming home. Brooke still flashes back to the shadow of the gunman passing by their classroom door. “I’ll just see him,” she said. These past two weeks, she found some escape in a high school romance novel and rewatched “101 Dalmatians” and other Disney movies from her childhood. Her parents tried to calibrate when to hold her close and when to give her space. Ms. Harrison said she would quietly try to check in by calling Brooke to ask if she wanted a drink from Starbucks or needed anything from Target. And when Brooke declined to attend her 12-year-old brother’s birthday party, she reminded her mother that she sometimes just needed to be alone. On Wednesday, traffic around the school slowed to a crawl as Brooke and her mother drew close. They passed heavily armed police officers and television cameras. Students walked through a colonnade of police officers from nearby cities and teachers from their old middle and elementary schools who waved signs of support. “Welcome back, welcome back,” one sheriff’s deputy said. “I feel like I’m on an episode of ‘C.S.I.,’” Brooke said.  “How is this our school?” her mother asked. “How is this happening?” Ms. Harrison’s voice trembled. “This is unbelievable. It’s making me sad.” “Mom, please don’t cry.” They pulled into a circular driveway, near a banner that declared “WELCOME EAGLES” — their school team name. Inside, over the course of this half-day, there would be hugs and joyful reunions laced with sadness and loss. Some students would break down crying as they said the Pledge of Allegiance. Others would wipe away tears when they heard the alma mater. They would compare their memories, nuzzle therapy dogs and share their final text messages from now-absent friends. “We were just so happy to see each other,” Brooke would say. But not quite yet. Brooke and her mother quickly hugged, kissed and said I love you. And then the 14-year-old freshman who dreams about one day whirling across the globe as a travel journalist hopped out of her mom’s car, threaded her way past a sheriff’s officer and joined the river of children in burgundy T-shirts making their way back in.

Opinion,55," Supported by By Nicholas Kristof When a gunman rampaged through a high school in Parkland, Fla., three weeks ago, a 15-year-old soccer player named Anthony Borges showed undaunted courage. Anthony, who is of Venezuelan descent, apparently was the last of a group of students rushing into a classroom to seek refuge. He shut the door behind him and frantically tried to lock it, but in an instant the gunman appeared on the other side. Instead of running for cover, Anthony blocked the door to keep the shooter out. He held his ground even as the attacker opened fire. “I asked him why he would do that,” his lawyer, Alex Arreaza, told me. “He said, ‘What’s so hard to understand about what I did?’ He had no issue with risking his life.” Shot five times in the legs and torso, Anthony phoned his father to say that he had been wounded. He was rushed to a hospital and survived: Photos show him with wires and tubes snaking from him. He still can’t walk — it’s unclear if that is just temporary — but fellow students say he saved their lives. No one else in that classroom was shot. The world turned upside down: Armed law enforcement officers dawdled outside during the shooting, but a 15-year-old kid without any weapon at all used himself as a human shield to protect his classmates. More broadly, the Florida high school students have argued maturely for sensible gun laws, while Florida state legislators have acted like frightened toddlers, first passing a two-year moratorium on sales of AR-15 rifles and then undoing it 15 minutes later. And now it seems that the grown-up world is again going to fail Anthony and other young Americans. Congress and President Trump have stalled on a push to pass meaningful gun legislation that has overwhelming public support. The grown-ups are once more loitering in a crisis, leaving kids to be shot. President Trump said that if he had been on the scene, he would have rushed into the building to confront the shooter. “I’d run in there even if I didn’t have a weapon,” he said. Really? Even though when he is armed with the power of the White House he still doesn’t have the guts to confront the N.R.A. in a sustained way? Given that gun owners largely trust Trump, he could hammer out a bipartisan deal for universal background checks — the single step that would make the most difference, one supported overwhelmingly even by gun owners — but the White House is AWOL on the issue. Congress may pass “Fix NICS” legislation to improve the F.B.I. database used to screen gun buyers, and maybe the federal government will ban “bump stocks.” But those are baby steps that probably won’t have a measurable impact on American mortality (right now, one American dies every 15 minutes from a gun, including murders, accidents and suicides). Incredibly, Congress seems as likely to ease gun laws as to tighten them. One measure backed by Donald Trump Jr. would legalize silencers, which have been rigorously controlled since the 1930s. Advocates had the gall to call it the Hearing Protection Act. “It’s about safety,” Trump Jr. explains in a video. “It’s about hearing protection. It’s a health issue, frankly, for me. Getting little kids in the game.” In fact, the unmuffled crack of a gunshot is a warning of danger and draws the police; silencers would be a gift to criminals. Even worse, the N.R.A. is pushing concealed-carry reciprocity, allowing people to carry concealed guns with them from places that permit them, like Alaska or Wyoming, to any other part of the country, regardless of local prohibitions. This measure has already passed the House of Representatives, but attorneys general are fighting it. They warn that it would let a stalker, domestic abuser or suspected terrorist from a low-regulation state tote concealed weapons at will around the country. All this is infuriating. But even if the federal government won’t pass meaningful new gun laws, states are doing so. Polls show that voters overwhelmingly favor universal background checks, a 21-year-old age restriction on buying firearms and a ban on high-capacity magazines. Since the 1970s, the U.S. has engaged unintentionally in an international experiment, relaxing gun laws as the rest of the world has tightened access. Gun advocates argued that more guns would make us safer, but instead the U.S. now has 25 times the gun murder rate of other advanced countries. Indeed, since 1970, more Americans have died of gun violence, including murders, suicides and accidents (1.4 million), than in all the wars in American history (1.3 million). Whenever there is a mass shooting, there are inspiring individual stories like Anthony’s. But the larger picture is disgraceful: the president and congressional leaders dillydallying on the sidelines, sending “thoughts and prayers” and nothing else. This will change only when politicians are more afraid of voters than of the N.R.A. ☐ Gail Collins is off today. I invite you to sign up for my free, twice-weekly email newsletter.

Washington,56," 
                On Washington             By                     
                                    CARL HULSE
                            
                FEB. 28, 2018 WASHINGTON — Here’s how significant things don’t get done in Washington even in a moment of crisis and opportunity. The president throws out a hodgepodge of ideas, thoroughly confusing both sides about what he really supports. Senate Republicans, grappling for an answer that responds to public clamor but doesn’t alienate their conservative base, would prefer instead to focus on a small fix unlikely to satisfy many people even if it could overcome internal divisions. House Republicans say they will wait to see what the Senate does — though history has shown that can be a very long wait. Democrats push for a broad debate that Republicans want nothing to do with. That’s where Washington stands now on the subject of new gun legislation after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Despite immense public pressure in part from students who escaped the attack, the outlook for any consequential action remains dim as the president and lawmakers diverge on how best to respond. President Trump upended the discussion on Wednesday during a bipartisan White House meeting with lawmakers. He seemed to side more with Democrats than Republicans on gun rights, chided fellow Republicans for fearing the National Rifle Association and even suggested that guns should be summarily confiscated from suspects who raise red flags, forcing them to go to court to regain them. Such an approach toward gun rights runs counter to Republican dogma, as did other suggestions that the president made.  But the meeting was very similar to an earlier White House session in which the president seemed to join with Democrats on divisive immigration policy only to later reverse course, leaving the parties at an impasse. Members of both parties expressed skepticism on Wednesday that the White House meeting would lead to a breakthrough. They even suggested that it could prove counterproductive by forcing the gun lobby to dig in its heels and by making Republican leaders unwilling to push ahead given the possibility of glaring divisions with Mr. Trump. Officials said the next issue on the Senate agenda was likely to be a rollback of banking regulations, not increased gun control.  Mr. Trump’s stream-of-consciousness display was just the latest wrinkle in the contentious struggle over gun safety. The most widely backed response to the Parkland shooting would provide new incentives for public agencies to submit information that could disqualify prospective gun buyers to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, an action most agree is modest at best. Even though they support it themselves, leading Democrats consider that proposal, sponsored by Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, to be woefully insufficient given the scope of the mass shootings. “The Cornyn bill is kind of a fig leaf,” said Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, one of the Democrats up for re-election in a state that President Trump carried in 2016. To Democrats, the fact that the N.R.A. is not opposed to the proposal is prima facie evidence that it falls short. They are demanding a more robust debate over a series of gun initiatives, notably what they call a “universal” background check system that would cover all gun transactions in the country. That plan is opposed by the gun lobby but was seemingly endorsed by Mr. Trump, putting him at odds not only with the gun advocacy group that strongly backed him, but with many congressional Republicans, as well. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and an author, with Mr. Cornyn, of the more limited background check bill, equated taking up his own legislation without allowing consideration of alternatives to “slamming the door in the face of all these kids who are demanding change.” “I think it is imperative that we rise to the moment,” Mr. Murphy said. Mr. Trump told lawmakers they should use a broader bipartisan background check measure that failed in 2013 after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., as the basis for a comprehensive measure that could take in many proposals, including the Cornyn plan, new mental health provisions and added security for schools. He urged backers of a renewed ban on assault weapons to make their case to the authors of the legislation and said he would welcome the opportunity to enact one sweeping bill to combat mass shootings. But Congress has for years been unable to make even incremental headway on new gun buying limits, let alone the type of multifaceted plan called for by the president. Democrats would like to persuade Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, to allow votes on major gun control proposals, a plan that could throw the Senate into a full-blown showdown over competing initiatives. But Mr. McConnell is never one to rush into a fight that divides his own party if he can help it. While Mr. McConnell has been quiet about his intentions, Mr. Cornyn opened the door to that possibility of a wider debate provided it could get to passage of his bill at a minimum.  “We can set up a situation where they can vote on those amendments,” he said. “What I don’t want to do is leave here this week and go back home to Texas and say we failed to do anything to try to address these tragedies.” As lawmakers quibbled about how to proceed, some of the multiple proposals promoted by Mr. Trump were falling by the wayside. Republican lawmakers seem uninterested in plans to raise the age to buy all guns to 21. The idea of arming teachers was also getting a cold reception. Among plans circulating that could draw bipartisan support was a measure that would prevent those on federal no-fly lists from buying guns, though that approach has met Republican resistance in the past. Hoping to skirt a divisive debate, Republicans preferred to focus on other remedies, like improving general school safety, while pointing to law enforcement failures surrounding the Parkland shooting. Democrats remained doubtful that Republicans would be willing to buck the N.R.A., particularly in an election year, but said it would be an imperative for legislative success. “You can’t solve this problem and please the N.R.A.,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “Our Republican colleagues need to learn that.” Given longstanding political conflict over the issue, many lawmakers in both parties anticipate the push for new laws will likely fall apart as so many others have in the aftermath of mass shootings. If that is the outcome, the determined high school students and their allies who have helped drive the debate to this point seem unlikely to let the issue go. Maybe the difference this time isn’t that Congress will act, but it is that those pushing Congress will not allow lawmakers to so quickly move on after they don’t.

Opinion,57," Supported by Opinion By Mary Hollis Inboden When I was 12 years old I went to five funerals in one week. My classmates and I sat clutching one another on crowded church pews listening to Celine Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On,” wearing thick white ribbons on our chests like scarlet A’s. We were thrust into a small and terrible “survivors club.” The Westside Middle School shooting is often forgotten, not because it happened 20 years ago, but because it happened so many shootings ago. Before terms like “mass shooting” and “active shooter” entered our common vernacular, one of my classmates stole into our rural middle school in Jonesboro, Ark., right after lunch. He pulled the fire alarm, sending the rest of us out onto the playground, where he and another heavily armed classmate fired on us from the nearby woods. My best friend, Paige Herring, was killed that day along with three other girls and our beloved sixth-grade English teacher. Ten other people were injured. I’ve had a lot of practice over the years trying to tell that story as quickly as possible, to jog people’s memories with the buzzwords. Not many people outside of our little community remember Westside. “Which shooting was yours?” people ask. The shooting at Westside was 13 months before Columbine. At the time, it was an anomaly and seemed to jolt the entire country. America mourned with us — buckets of flowers, handmade cards and books on grief poured in, making us feel less alone. The ritual is now familiar, and I see it in the outpouring of support for the students from Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed last month. The list of the unthinkable — kids shot at school — has gotten so much longer since 1998. Every time another shooting occurs, I enter a near-catatonic state. It’s almost impossible to talk about with anyone who hasn’t experienced one, though. How do you bring that up on a third date after the shooting at Pulse or with your cubicle mate after the massacre at Newtown? There’s one group who understands all of this: my classmates from the playground, my fellow survivors. We call ourselves the Westside Warriors. It’s with them, on our class Facebook page, that I feel least alone when new tragedies occur and where I can visit Paige in vivid color just as she was. I imagine that most alumni pages are saved for hilarious pictures of bad hair and weird jeans or used to swap stories about how crazy 10th-grade homecoming was. We don’t share stories like that. We share pictures of the classmates we lost. We talk about how hard it is to turn off the TV after the newest deadly event. We communicate to keep the memorial garden, our old school playground, manicured. We collect condolence gifts to send to the newest victims as if we’re the ambassadors of grief. It’s what was done for us. Most important, the Facebook page is our refuge every March. This March 24 will mark the 20th anniversary of the shooting at Westside Middle School. It’s also the chosen date of the March for Our Lives rally, part of the movement led by students to do something about gun violence. I had already been dreading this March. Not only was I to mourn the 20th anniversary of our shooting, but also the Las Vegas shooting, from last fall, and Sutherland Springs, Tex., immediately following, in November — the sadness of each shooting attached itself to my own. The Facebook page had been steadfast, though, there for anniversaries, other shootings or just the down days, and we members help each other get through. I imagined on the 20th anniversary that we would come together and indulge in our grief as always. We would post and text and email and call, carrying the torch for our sweet, sad, little day. Then 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. So, this March 24 — 20 years after the shooting on our playground — will no longer be about just us. My immediate reaction to hearing about the March for Our Lives was anger and indignation, because now Paige’s memory would be one mixed in with so many. I called a friend from the playground, and we talked it through and agreed to march. And it felt good to have something to do on that terrible day, a day when it’s normally hard to even get out of bed. We now had a plan. We would be together in Washington, standing on our grown-up feet and remembering Westside while walking for everyone who’s experienced this. And I thought the Warriors would agree; I thought that would be the clear consensus. That’s why my breath was taken away by a post to the Facebook group that denounced the march entirely. Some members were upset that the day was being taken from us, but many were even more upset about the agenda of the event. They thought it was purposely planned to drive a political point home, one that they did not agree with. People posted that the organizers were “against all guns,” that they chose “our day of remembrance” for their political agenda. People talked about arming teachers, increasing security, running “lockdown drills.” I understand that some people make an argument for preparedness over prevention, but it is an argument that I can’t accept. If my classmates think back to 1998, I imagine they’ll remember our teachers were white as sheets and frozen with fear. I personally had to shove a grown woman aside in order to dial 911 because she was in understandable shock. One teacher was able to pull a student to cover and safety, but that was the most she could do. She couldn’t have fought off our attackers and I don’t think it would have been right to ask her to. No person knows how he or she would react in a time like that, so the idea of arming teachers lends itself to a false sense of security. Beyond my lack of confidence in the practicality of arming teachers as a solution, the discussion made me incredibly sad. It meant we accept this as our new norm. Westside was the beginning of an epidemic. It was jarring to find a group of survivors — my former classmates — as divided as our country. It felt like they were responding with jaded, grown-up brains instead of the honest, childhood hearts we had when we were younger. I cannot accept that more guns will solve the issue of more shootings. Some of my classmates wrote that they “don’t want to be lumped into the gun debate,” but you cannot talk about a shooting without talking about guns. They send journals to the newest survivors, encouraging them to write their feelings and begin their healing. But this is a generation that has grown up with many platforms to voice their opinions, and they’re not satisfied with hiding their thoughts in a journal tucked away on a shelf. Standing up, speaking out and marching may be part of their therapy. One of the comments to our Facebook thread read: “It’s just all different than ours was. These people have a serious agenda: to get rid of guns.” That’s true. It is different than ours. These victims are helping themselves by fighting for common-sense gun laws to save the future. Each March 24 is harder for me than the last because, as an adult, I’m able to better define how horrific the shooting really was. In less than 10 minutes on that playground, my classmates and I gained a deeper understanding of evil and fear than most people experience in their entire lives. I can’t trade the Warriors for a group that agrees with me, but I can march this weekend in Washington to ensure that in 20 years Emma González won’t be writing to remind you of her story and her friends. She’ll be writing to commemorate the day we stood up and said never again. Mary Hollis Inboden (@maryhollis) is an actor in Los Angeles.

National,58," By PATRICIA MAZZEIFEB. 26, 2018 MIAMI — The only armed sheriff’s deputy on campus during the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., disputed on Monday that he violated police protocol by not entering the building to hunt down the gunman, and rebuked the sheriff for portraying him as a “coward.” Scot Peterson, a former deputy with the Broward County sheriff’s office, said in a statement released by his lawyer that he thought the gunfire originated from outside and reacted accordingly by waiting for the suspect there. The sheriff’s office “trains its officers that in the event of outdoor gunfire one is to seek cover and assess the situation in order to communicate what one observes to other law enforcement,” said Mr. Peterson’s lawyer, Joseph A. DiRuzzo III. His statement appeared to contradict the sheriff, Scott Israel, who said last week that Mr. Peterson should have immediately charged the building instead of taking a position outside for more than four minutes while the shooting was taking place. Sheriff Israel characterized Mr. Peterson’s inaction as doing “nothing.”  Mr. Peterson should have “went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer,” Sheriff Israel said.  “Let there be no mistake, Mr. Peterson wishes that he could have prevented the untimely passing of the seventeen victims on that day, and his heart goes out to the families of the victims in their time of need,” Mr. DiRuzzo said in a statement. “However, the allegations that Mr. Peterson was a coward and that his performance, under the circumstances, failed to meet the standards of police officers are patently untrue.” It is unclear why Mr. Peterson nevertheless chose to retire on Thursday after Sheriff Israel placed him under internal investigation. Sheriff Israel has said the investigation will continue despite the deputy’s departure. The sheriff’s office is under intense scrutiny over its response to the Feb. 14 shooting. The office’s active shooter protocol says that on-scene deputies, without approval from a supervisor, “may” engage the gunman. That appears to give deputies discretion, but only to a point: They “may” choose not to go in if they know a door is armed with a large explosive device, for example, or if they know the only way into a building has a dangerous suspect immediately on the other side ready to shoot the deputy, Col. Jim Polan explained in written responses to questions. Otherwise, deputies are expected to prioritize the lives of victims by trying to confront the gunman as quickly as possible. Sheriff Israel said on the day of the massacre that it appeared the shooting had begun and then continued outside the building, and that three people had died outside the school. But on Monday, his office said, “The shooting occurred inside.” Mr. Peterson initially received a call of “firecrackers — and not gunfire” near the freshman building, the statement from his lawyer said.      The deputy and a school security specialist, Kelvin Greenleaf, left the building they were in and ran a couple of hundred yards north, according to Mr. DiRuzzo’s account. Once there, Mr. Peterson “took up a tactical position” in the corridor between two other buildings and was the first to advise the sheriff’s office dispatch that he heard gunshots. Mr. Peterson also initiated a “code red” to put the entire school on lockdown. Mr. Peterson told the first police officer to arrive, from the Coral Springs Police Department, that he believed the gunman to be outside, Mr. DiRuzzo said. The officer took up a position behind a tree with a rifle about 20 yards away from the deputy.  “‘Radio transmissions indicated that there was a gunshot victim in the area of the football field,’” the statement said, apparently quoting Mr. Peterson, “which served to confirm Mr. Peterson’s belief ‘that the shooter, or shooters, were outside.’” Mr. DiRuzzo also credited Mr. Peterson with “the presence of mind” to have administrators review surveillance camera footage to try to locate the gunman, and to provide his building keys and a diagram of the campus to specialized Coral Springs and Broward County units when they arrived. Confusion over the surveillance footage caused Coral Springs officers to think they were viewing video in real time when in fact the images were on a 20-minute delay, and the suspect, Nikolas Cruz, had long fled the school on foot. He was arrested later on a residential street about two miles from campus. Efforts since Feb. 17 to reach Mr. Greenleaf, the security specialist who might be able to corroborate Mr. Peterson’s account, have not been successful. Mr. DiRuzzo said Mr. Peterson plans to cooperate with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which has been directed by Gov. Rick Scott to investigate the local police response to the shooting. Mr. Peterson believes the investigation will “clear his name” after being “maligned” by the sheriff. Before his effective resignation on Thursday, Mr. Peterson was often celebrated at the sheriff’s office as a well-performing school resource officer. A review of his personnel file, which the office released in full on Friday, showed decades of annual reviews in which he was judged to have met or exceeded expectations. “He values his position and takes pride in protecting the students, faculty and staff at his school,” a sergeant wrote last year. “Deputy Peterson is dependable and reliable and handles issues that arise with tact and solid judgment.” Alan Blinder contributed reporting.

Opinion,59," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Christine Yared Parkland, Fla. — I am a freshman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. In the days since the attack that killed 17 people here, I have continued replaying those terrifying moments in my head. It began when a fire alarm went off just before school was supposed to end. We thought nothing of it. People in my finance class had already left, and I grabbed my backpack to evacuate. The next thing I knew I heard people running and shouting, and my teacher yelling at us to get back in the class. I sprinted to her closet and crammed myself against shelves filled with papers and binders. The rest of the closet filled up with the other students. We thought it was an active shooter drill. It wasn’t. My phone flooded with messages from friends and family, from other states and other countries, asking if I was O.K. The world knew what was happening even before we did. I texted my sister to make sure everything was all right with her. I checked in with my friends, and most of them were safe, or had evacuated. I texted my family and told them that I loved them. My classmates scoured the internet, searching for news about what was happening. We found out the shooter was in the freshman building, 50 feet away from our classroom. I was busy shaking in the corner of my little bunker, trying to calm my panic, while rumors about the shooter and the victims arrived by text and Snapchat. We could hear loud noises outside. Were they gunshots? We weren’t sure. After over an hour of confusion and heat, the police SWAT team finally came to get us. We ran out with our phones in our pockets, and our hands over our heads. I have never run so fast. I met up with my friends and sat with them, still in shock. I saw kids crying, traumatized. At home it still didn’t feel real. We tried to watch some TV to distract ourselves. We saw celebrities and politicians talking about our school. But it didn’t feel like our school, it seemed like a movie, a dream, a nightmare. My parents worked hard to leave war-torn Lebanon so that their children would never have to experience the violence and loss that they did. My dad was a first-aid volunteer with the Lebanese Red Cross. He continued his engineering education, worked for General Electric in France and was transferred to the United States. My family lived in Utah; Colorado, where I was born; Minnesota; and finally Florida. My parents chose Parkland to settle in because of Marjory Stoneman Douglas’s stellar reputation, and because we thought that it was a safe place to live. But that isn’t true anymore. The promise of safety and security failed us. One week ago, nobody knew about the small suburb that was Parkland. Now every time I look up “Marjory Stoneman Douglas” on the internet, the top suggestion is “shooting.” My friends, classmates and teachers are dead. I see the media portraying them as good children who were smart and kind, but they were much more than that. My friend Gina is dead. I had just talked to her that morning in art class. We laughed together, we sang together, we smiled together. We will never do that again. How could someone be this despicable? When I think about it, I start bawling. We can’t let innocent people’s deaths be in vain. We need to work together beyond political parties to make sure this never happens again. We need tougher gun laws. If a person is not old enough to be able to rent a car or buy a beer, then he should not be able to legally purchase a weapon of mass destruction. This could have been prevented. If the killer had been properly treated for his mental illness, maybe this would not have happened. If there were proper background checks, then those who should not have guns would not have them. We need to vote for those who are for stricter laws and kick out those who won’t take action. We need to expose the truth about gun violence and the corruption around guns. Please. It’s devastating that this happened on Valentine’s Day, a day that’s supposed to be about love. Take this as a sign to hug your loved ones and be sure to tell them you love them every day because you never know when it will be their last. If you have any heart, or care about anyone or anything, you need to be an advocate for change. Don’t let any more children suffer like we have. Don’t continue this cycle. This may not seem relevant to you. But next time it could be your family, your friends, your neighbors. Next time, it could be you. Christine Yared is 15.

Opinion,60," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Carson Abt Parkland, Fla. — As a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it’s hard for me to believe that the school on TV is mine. No one believes a school shooting will happen to them until they are scrambling to find their friends and family. In the end, 17 families were not able to find their loved ones. As Albus Dumbledore, the wise headmaster of Harry Potter’s Hogwarts, said, “Happiness can be found in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.” My teachers are the light. Through a combination of training and determination, they calmed the fear of some and saved the lives of others. When schools across the country lower their flags and share our darkness, they should also share our light. Maybe heroism can’t be taught, but preparedness certainly can be. Every teacher should have training for a school shooting like mine did. On Wednesday, I took that message to President Trump at his White House listening session with students and parents from Parkland. The next day, he announced his disapproval of my idea that schools should have more active shooter training. If I had known he felt this way, I would have told him my story. Fifteen minutes before the dismissal bell, the fire alarm rang and my class was evacuated after an administrator came on the intercom and gave the order. By the time the administrator made the announcement to take shelter in classrooms, we were too far away to turn back. So we kept going. The entire time, teachers were calling for their students to stay close as they tried to count them all. The teachers were calm, so the students tried to stay calm too. My teacher for that class, Ms. Hitchcock, told us to keep walking. It was reassuring when she took attendance and the entire class was present. Ms. Hitchcock provided order in a moment of chaos. I knew at least some of my friends were safe. Our school regularly has fire drills (as we did the morning of the shooting), tornado drills and lockdown drills. Just six weeks ago, my teachers did a training session on active shooter situations, known as Code Red. All doors must be locked, lights are turned off and students are kept in the classrooms away from windows. For any type of emergency or drill, teachers must account for all their students. After the training, the teachers discussed with the students in each of their classes what to do. We were told where to hide and how to evacuate. Not every school has the training we do. Eighteen states do not require their school districts to develop emergency plans, according to the Government Accountability Office. In the rest, 59 percent of districts reported difficulty balancing emergency planning with other priorities. There is no priority higher than saving lives. My teachers’ training saved lives. Teachers frantically yelled for their students to go back into classrooms, saving some who were unknowingly running toward the shooter. Mr. Gard, my math teacher two years ago, evacuated his classroom due to the fire alarm that went off just before the shooting started. But he immediately pulled the students back into his classroom closet when the Code Red was declared. He turned off the lights, locked his classroom door and counted his students. Mr. Gard knew what to do and he saved lives as a result. At the sound of gunshots, one of my teachers last year, Mr. Rospierski, hurried students into locked classrooms, a protocol reinforced in the teacher training sessions. Then he stayed in the hallway to guide eight stranded students away from the shooter, who was in that same hallway. My high school is not the only one to benefit from training for a situation like this. Three months ago, an elementary school in Northern California blocked a shooter from entering classrooms using similar protocols and saving countless lives. Every district can make itself safer through similar training. Active-shooter training is not the panacea to end school shootings. But it is an essential part of keeping schools safe. Whether one supports arming teachers, an assault weapons ban, or any other measure to reduce gun violence, everyone should see that active-shooter training should be part of a program to address school shootings. President Trump is hosting governors from all 50 states to discuss school safety. I urge him to talk to Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, who has proposed increasing the amount of training and drills for active shooter scenarios. I ask him to think about my story.

Business,61," Supported by By Jack Nicas and Sheera Frenkel SAN FRANCISCO — On Wednesday, one week after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., Facebook and YouTube vowed to crack down on the trolls. Thousands of posts and videos had popped up on the sites, falsely claiming that survivors of the shooting were paid actors or part of various conspiracy theories. Facebook called the posts “abhorrent.” YouTube, which is owned by Google, said it needed to do better. Both promised to remove the content. The companies have since aggressively pulled down many posts and videos and reduced the visibility of others. Yet on Friday, spot searches of the sites revealed that the noxious content was far from eradicated. On Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, searches for the hashtag #crisisactor, which accused the Parkland survivors of being actors, turned up hundreds of posts perpetuating the falsehood (though some also criticized the conspiracy theory). Many of the posts had been tweaked ever so slightly — for example, videos had been renamed #propaganda rather than #hoax — to evade automated detection. And on YouTube, while many of the conspiracy videos claiming that the students were actors had been taken down, other videos that claimed the shooting had been a hoax remained rife. Facebook faced renewed criticism on Friday after it was revealed that the company showcased a virtual reality shooting game at the Conservative Political Action Conference this week. Facebook said it was removing the game from its demonstration of its new virtual reality products. The resilience of misinformation, despite efforts by the tech behemoths to eliminate it, has become a real-time case study of how the companies are constantly a step behind in stamping out the content. At every turn, trolls, conspiracy theorists and others have proved to be more adept at taking advantage of exactly what the sites were created to do — encourage people to post almost anything they want — than the companies are at catching them. “They’re not able to police their platforms when the type of content that they’re promising to prohibit changes on a too-frequent basis,” Jonathon Morgan, founder of New Knowledge, a company that tracks disinformation online, said of Facebook and YouTube. The difficulty of dealing with inappropriate online content stands out with the Parkland shooting because the tech companies have effectively committed to removing any accusations that the Parkland survivors were actors, a step they did not take after other recent mass shootings, such as last October’s massacre in Las Vegas. In the past, the companies typically addressed specific types of content only when it was illegal — posts from terrorist organizations, for example — Mr. Morgan said. Facebook and YouTube’s promises follow a stream of criticism in recent months over how their sites can be gamed to spread Russian propaganda, among other abuses. The companies have said they are betting big on artificial intelligence systems to help identify and take down inappropriate content, though that technology is still being developed. The companies have in the meantime hired or said they plan to hire more people to comb through what is posted to their sites. Facebook said it was hiring 1,000 new moderators to review content and was making changes to what type of news publishers would be favored on the social network. YouTube has said that it plans to have 10,000 moderators by year’s end and that it is altering its search algorithms to return more videos from reliable news sources. Mary deBree, head of content policy at Facebook, said the company had not been perfect at staving off certain content and most likely would not be in the future. “False information is like any other challenge where humans are involved: It evolves, much like a rumor or urban legend would. It also masks itself as legitimate speech,” she said. “Our job is to do better at keeping this bad content off Facebook without undermining the reason people come here — to see things happening in the world around them and have a conversation about them.” A YouTube spokeswoman said in a statement that the site updated its harassment policy last year “to include hoax videos that target the victims of these tragedies. Any video flagged to us that violates this policy is reviewed and then removed.” For many people, getting around Facebook and YouTube’s hunt to remove noxious content is straightforward. The sites have automated detection systems that often search for specific terms or images that have previously been deemed unacceptable. So to evade those systems, people sometimes can alter images or switch to different terminology. Sam Woolley, an internet researcher at the nonprofit Institute for the Future, said far-right groups had started using internet brands to describe minorities — like “Skype” to indicate Jewish people — to trick software and human reviewers. Those who post conspiracy theories also tend to quickly repost or engage with similar posts from other accounts, creating a sort of viral effect that can cause the sites’ algorithms to promote the content as a trending topic or a recommended video, said David Carroll, a professor at the New School who studies tech platforms. That duplication and repackaging of misinformation “make the game of snuffing it out Whac-a-Mole to the extreme,” he said. That game played out across the web in the past few days, after a video suggesting that one of the most vocal Parkland survivors, David Hogg, was an actor became the No. 1 trending video on YouTube. After a public outcry, YouTube removed the video and said it would take down other “crisis actor” videos because they violated its ban on bullying. YouTube has since scrubbed its site of many such videos. Yet some of the videos remained, possibly because they used slightly different terminology. One clip that had drawn more than 77,000 views by Friday described the shooting survivors as “disaster performers” instead of “crisis actors.” Other videos that were not about the Parkland survivors but that called the entire shooting into question also stayed online. A video posted last week by Alex Jones, the founder of the conspiracy theory site Infowars, titled “Red Alert! Evidence Mounts Florida Attacks Is a Giant False Flag” had attracted more than 300,000 views by Friday. On Facebook, some of the posts the social network had vowed to ban were still gaining traction. One lengthy post had been shared more than 3,800 times by early Friday. The post included a photo of Mr. Hogg and his classmate Emma Gonzalez with the text “Globalist Deep State Crisis Actors.” After The New York Times contacted the author of the post, a self-described political analyst named John Miranda, the post disappeared. It is unclear if Facebook removed it. Mr. Miranda did not respond to a request for comment. The tech companies’ increasing efforts to remove misinformation have a side effect: angering some of their most active users. Moe Othman, a comedian and commentator on YouTube who has about 60,000 subscribers, said that within 10 minutes of posting a video on Wednesday that suggested some Parkland students were actors, YouTube removed it and placed a strike on his account. YouTube terminates accounts after three strikes. Mr. Othman said in a private message on Twitter: “I’m not surprised. We live in a world where information is one of the most important tools.” He added, “In this case, I see YouTube as a censoring machine.” Would he stop using YouTube? No, he said, “mainly because I’m still a comedian who simply wants to make people laugh.” Follow Jack Nicas and Sheera Frenkel on Twitter: @jacknicas and @sheeraf        Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS",2018-02-24,0.21725151,Saturday
National,62,"Even as they raise millions of dollars and plan nationwide rallies to stop gun violence, students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School struggle with nightmares. By JACK HEALYFEB. 25, 2018 PARKLAND, Fla. — After a gunman turned their high school into a sprawling crime scene last week, three freshman friends leapt into the student movement for tougher gun laws. They rode a bus to the State Capitol and chased down lawmakers. They vowed to march on Washington. They shouted and waved signs saying “Protect Kids” and “Stop Killing the Future.” But at night, in the blackness that recalls the dark classroom where she hid as a gunman murdered her classmates, Samara Barrack, 15, cannot stop thinking about that afternoon, when she fled through a blood-covered hallway. Samantha Deitsch, also 15, grieves a friend from journalism class. Aria Siccone, 14, who walked past the bodies of students from her last-period study hall, feels nothing sometimes. Just numbness. “I keep having flashbacks,” Samara said. “There’s times I want to cry and can’t. There’s times I want to have fun and am hysterical.” This is the reality that confronts students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School when the cameras turn off and the day’s rallies are over. They have won praise for their strength and eloquence on the world’s stage. But even as they raise millions of dollars and plan nationwide rallies, parse the details of assault-weapons laws and spar with politicians and conservative critics, the young survivors of the massacre are struggling with the loss of their friends and educators, and the nightmares that flood back in moments of stillness.  And Parkland, once named Florida’s safest city by a home-security group, is today a place carved open by rage, grief and questions about whether any child, anywhere, can ever be safe from a spray of bullets. It is a place where friends now attend counseling together, where parents worry how their children will head to campus when classes resume on Wednesday. It is a place where strangers hug one another in a memorial park that bears crosses and Stars of David for the 17 victims, where others break down as they lay flowers at the fence surrounding M.S.D., as the school is known. “It’s ripped the rug out because we’re such a close-knit community,” the Parkland mayor, Christine Hunschofsky, said.  The Spanish-tiled houses and fairway-view homes of subdivisions named Heron Bay and Water’s Edge are filled with families who chose Parkland for its schools and safety. It draws families from Florida and beyond, and the parental contact lists for school groups are filled with area codes from Boston, New Jersey, New York and Philadelphia. Children ride their bikes to community pools and grow up listening to alligators chortle at night. The Parkland bubble, people call it. “It’s beautiful and brand-new, and has been since I’ve gotten here,” said Sara Giovanello, a senior whose family moved from Long Island, N.Y., when she was 9. “I feel like they’re building something more every day.” And to teachers and parents, Stoneman Douglas High School, with its rank of 50th in the state by U.S. News and World Report and its 94 percent graduation rate, was its crown jewel. It is a vast campus of 3,000 students whose schedules overflow with extracurricular activities: sports, speech, drama, literary clubs, a gay-straight alliance, poetry slams, television production, a marching band and more. Caitlyn Rosenblatt, 16, who grew up here, put it like this: “The day I was born, my parents knew I was going to Stoneman Douglas.” Before the shooting, arguments over gun control were hashed out in debate classes. Meditations on isolation and death were composed for speech tournaments. A congressman who represents the heavily Democratic area addressed students at the invitation of the politics club. Student mental-health issues were discussed in The Eagle Eye, the school newspaper. Now, as students brace themselves to return to classes this week, evenings at friends’ houses have turned into organizing meetings. Group phone chats that once revolved around physics problems and A.P. Literature sonnets are now filled with plans for rallies, vigils and news about legislation and gun politics. Their personal social media accounts are now hugely popular springboards for action, such as the student journalist David Hogg’s call for a boycott of Florida’s spring break season if lawmakers do not tighten gun laws. Students said that activism has helped them grieve, and wrought some purpose from the senseless killings of their friends. Ashley Turner, a senior, made plans to donate blood, and said she thought enduring all of this would make her stronger. But she still wakes in the middle of the night, her heart pounding, her body beaded with sweat. “I attended five funerals,” she said. “There are times where I just want to cry. There are times when I feel nothing. There are times where I feel angry and just want to snap at people.”      Jack Haimowitz, 18, now rarely falls asleep before 1 a.m., so every night, he chooses three friends from his phone contacts and calls to check in. Are you eating? Are you O.K.? Some scroll through their phones for hours, scared to sleep, Jack said. Others feel helpless or cry when he calls.  He thinks all the time about his friend Joaquin Oliver — Guac to friends — who loved football and basketball. Jack sometimes thumbs through the text messages he sent Joaquin after the shots were fired, asking where he was, whether he was injured, whether the rumors were true, begging for a reply. Even tiny things can reanimate what some students simply call “the event.” Lea Serrano, 14, who heard the shooting from just a few feet away, flinched a day later when her father handed her an object wrapped in black. It was simply a bag with headphones inside. A set of keys jangling when she and her family were at a seafood restaurant prompted fears that someone would shoot her. “This stuff comes in waves,” she said. But the world was calm for the moment in Samara Barrack’s backyard, the pool washing a soft blue light over the three friends who bounced and laughed on a trampoline. They had been leaning on one another more than ever since the shooting, sleeping over and texting and sharing memories of running the mile with Alaina Petty, killed at 14, or mimicking people in viral videos with Jaime Guttenberg, killed at 14. “We can be silly together,” Samara said. Aria, who witnessed part of the shooting through the window of her classroom door, has played and replayed those minutes in her head, trying to reconstruct what she saw and square it against reports on the news. She gets upset when she hears a detail that she insists is wrong. She knows, she says. She was there. “I don’t feel anything, and it’s really weird,” Aria said. “I can’t cry anymore. Or feel things.” They talked about being worried about their friends, how some seemed O.K. and others “not O.K.” They said they hoped to nudge a few toward counseling. Inside, the girls’ parents wondered what “O.K.” meant, now and in the future. They were awed by how their children had responded to the shooting by researching gun laws and trying to forge change. But they worried about how their children were processing the trauma and grief, and how they could ever reclaim their childhoods. “They had to grow up, just like that,” Samantha’s father, Rik Deitsch, said. “I don’t know if we’ve seen the worst,” said Steven Siccone, Aria’s father. “I think it’s still to come.”  “They’re happy when they’re with each other,” Samara’s mother, Michele Barrack, said. The girls went upstairs to Samara’s room, where they flopped onto her bed and cuddled a 6-week-old puppy that Samantha’s parents had bought after the shooting. They named it Misty, to echo M.S.D., and cooed at it and encouraged it to waddle across the floor. Then Samara’s sixth-grade sister offered a suggestion: “Let’s all talk about our fears.” Aria said hers was the doctor’s office: “Getting shots.” “Mine is yawning and your jaw getting stuck,” Samantha said. Samara thought for a moment. “Mine is being trapped in a room and having something close in on you.” Julie Turkewitz and Patricia Mazzei contributed reporting.

National,63," By PATRICIA MAZZEIMARCH 21, 2018 MIAMI — The Florida high school where a gunman killed 17 people last month will require students to carry only clear backpacks, school administrators announced on Wednesday, after the shooting suspect’s brother was charged with trespassing on campus and two students were arrested on charges of carrying knives. The episodes again called into question the safety of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a little more than a month after the deadly shooting that shook the affluent suburban community of Parkland, about an hour north of Miami. Robert W. Runcie, the superintendent of Broward County Public Schools, sent a letter to the families of Stoneman Douglas High students imposing the new backpack rule, reminiscent of security measures at airports and professional sports venues. He said any student without a clear backpack would be provided one at no cost after spring break, which takes place next week. Students also will be issued identification badges, which they will be required to wear at all times while in school. Staff members have badges as well.  In addition, Mr. Runcie said the district was considering using metal-detecting wands at school entrances and installing permanent metal detectors — a safety measure Mr. Runcie recently criticized as ineffective. A person intent on committing an atrocity would find his or her way around them, he said in an interview last month.  “Someone is not going to go through a metal detector with an AR-15,” he said at the time, adding that metal detectors do not help create a welcoming learning environment and pose a logistical challenge in a school as large as Stoneman Douglas High, which has more than 3,200 students. Stoneman Douglas High parents, already on edge since the massacre, became alarmed Monday when the shooting suspect’s brother was arrested on a charge of trespassing, after Broward County sheriff’s deputies said they saw him skateboarding onto the campus after school let out. A deputy assigned to patrol the campus was found asleep by a student the same afternoon, the sheriff’s office said; he was suspended without pay.      Some parents kept their children home on Tuesday, according to Sarahnell Murphy, an assistant state attorney prosecuting the trespassing case against Zachary Cruz, the brother of the shooting suspect, Nikolas Cruz. Also on Tuesday, the sheriff’s office said it had arrested three Stoneman Douglas High students, one for making threats on Snapchat and two for wielding knives. Jordan Salter, a girl accused of pulling a knife on a boy after a cafeteria confrontation, made a court appearance on Wednesday. Her father, Scott, told the court his daughter had been “terrified” of going to school. The arrests Monday and Tuesday prompted Gov. Rick Scott to offer state assistance to Mr. Runcie and the Broward sheriff, Scott Israel, to secure Stoneman Douglas High’s entryways. Sheriff Israel accepted the help; eight Florida Highway Patrol troopers will report to work at the school on Thursday, according to the governor’s office. In his letter on Wednesday, Mr. Runcie also outlined other steps the district was taking across county schools, such as evaluating “code red” active-shooter protocols and drills, and upgrading surveillance camera systems. Schools with multiple entry points would have single points of entry by the first quarter of 2019, he said. A new Florida law passed after the shooting will set aside $8.5 million for the school district to pay for at least one armed police officer at each school starting in the fall. Broward also will receive $6 million to expand school mental health services, according to Mr. Runcie. Reacting on Twitter to the news that only clear backpacks would be allowed at school, Kyra Parrow, a senior at Stoneman Douglas High, criticized the move as “making my school seem like jail now because legislators don’t have common sense gun reform on their agendas.” Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.

Insider,64," By ALEXANDRIA SYMONDS and RAILLAN BROOKSFEB. 16, 2018 For a recent essay, Dan Barry explores a difficult question: What are Americans to make of the routine we’ve developed when it comes to reacting to mass shootings? It’s a question journalists ask themselves, too — and one that informs The Times’s coverage of these events on the deepest level. When shootings happen as often as they do, “there is a certain similarity to the journalistic script,” said the National editor, Marc Lacey. Reporters know where to go and what to ask, and some themes recur from shooting to shooting. But the logistical playbook isn’t an emotional one, he emphasized: “Our job is to never allow this to become routine, and to, once we do confirm it, react and cover it aggressively, as though it’s the very first one we’ve covered.” The National desk receives reports of active gunman situations in the United States at least once a day, Mr. Lacey said, which percolate among many dozens of stories The Times considers in pursuit of the news that will drive the day. Early Wednesday afternoon, as reports of a potential active gunman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., began to surface on social media, reporters and editors monitored the situation and began to try to confirm details.  The Times’s Miami bureau chief, Patricia Mazzei, began making calls, while a correspondent, Audra D. S. Burch, and a stringer, Nick Madigan, were dispatched to the school. By 3:30 p.m., when the front-page meeting is held, editors had the sense it was likely to lead Thursday’s paper. Then came the work of putting together three initial stories: the straightforward news piece, a profile of the suspect and an article on the scene in Parkland.  “The National desk didn’t hand off the story to other editors until well past midnight,” Mr. Lacey said. “We were here again maybe five, six hours later, starting up again.” By early Thursday afternoon, less than 24 hours after the shooting, he estimated at least 25 reporters and 15 editors were working on the story. Elsewhere in the newsroom on Wednesday, the video and graphics teams began spinning up. Steve Duenes, an assistant managing editor and head of the Graphics desk, said that in breaking news events, the team starts by focusing on the scene. Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., hid in closets as a gunman fired a semiautomatic weapon into their classrooms. Seventeen people were killed. Within about an hour of learning the news, the team generated a locator map, which they then detailed with new information as reporters acquired it. The aim, Mr. Duenes explained, was to offer as much context as possible; because of a grim coincidence, they had something of a head start this time around. The Graphics department was already working on a piece about the more than 200 school shootings since the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012. They rushed to publish that story, he said, “to help readers understand the consistency of the events, the scale.” Video team producers watched while the full sweep of the attack came into view. But, helped by the ubiquity of recording technology and smartphones, they could begin pulling in visuals right away. “We were looking at how people were evacuated, and it seemed like half of the students were filming it,” said Mark Schleffler, the department’s news director. The first Times video went up in under two hours — one of their faster turnarounds. “One of the lessons we’ve learned is that people just want to know what happened,” Mr. Schleffler said. “We try to just capture the visceral moment on a first pass.” The Express Desk, a general assignment team that helps other desks with breaking news reporting and editing, monitored television broadcasts and social media feeds for more developments. Twitter, especially, can be a fruitful source of details — but also a dangerous one, susceptible to being clouded by misinformation, both unintentional and not. “I start with the basic assumption that everything I’m seeing is wrong, old or fake — and thus unusable,” said Daniel Victor, an Express reporter. “Then I work toward proving that it’s genuine, only then considering it for publication.” The immediate journalistic demands of covering a mass shooting are obvious: Gather as much information as possible, confirm it, convey it. What happens several days later, and in the following weeks, is less so; balancing on-the-spot reporting with deeper, more time-consuming analysis is a key concern. “We’re going to have a presence in this town for some time,” Mr. Lacey said of Parkland. “We’re not going to just disappear tomorrow. The New York Times tends to want to be one of the first people there and one of the last to go.” Given the similarities from shooting to shooting, it sometimes makes sense for the digital team to resurface material — on social media, the home page or both — The Times ran on previous occasions. On Thursday, a 2016 story by C. J. Chivers about the military-style weapons often used in mass shootings, including Wednesday’s, was of interest once again to readers. So were two Opinion pieces published after the Las Vegas shooting last year: one by Nicholas D. Kristof, suggesting several policy measures to curb gun violence; the other listing the top Congressional recipients of donations by the National Rifle Association. The repetition wears on journalists just as it wears on everyone. “Nobody enjoys covering mass shootings. Nobody does,” Mr. Lacey said. “Every American feels helpless about these awful incidents.” But, he added, he hopes the journalists he leads feel proud of their role in informing the public. “That’s your role in perhaps changing society,” he said, “by letting people know what actually occurred.” Keep up with Times Insider stories on Twitter, via the Reader Center: @ReaderCenter.

National,65," By VIVIAN YEE and ALAN BLINDERMARCH 14, 2018 Elon, N.C. Lapeer, Mich. Allendale, N.J. Parkland, Fla. Noblesville, Ind. Newtown, Conn. A month ago, hundreds of teenagers ran for their lives from the hallways and classrooms of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 students and staff had been shot to death. On Wednesday, driven by the conviction that they should never have to run from guns again, they walked. So did their peers. In New York City, in Chicago, in Atlanta and Santa Monica; at Columbine High School and in Newtown, Conn.; and in many more cities and towns, students left school by the hundreds and the thousands at 10 a.m., sometimes in defiance of school authorities, who seemed divided and even flummoxed about how to handle their emptying classrooms. The first major coordinated action of the student-led movement for gun control marshaled the same elements that had defined it ever since the Parkland shooting: eloquent young voices, equipped with symbolism and social media savvy, riding a resolve as yet untouched by cynicism.  “We have grown up watching more tragedies occur and continuously asking: Why?” said Kaylee Tyner, a 16-year-old junior at Columbine High School outside Denver, where 13 people were killed in 1999, inaugurating, in the public consciousness, the era of school shootings. “Why does this keep happening?”  Even after a year of near continuous protesting — for women, for the environment, for immigrants and more — the emergence of people not even old enough to drive as a political force has been particularly arresting, unsettling a gun control debate that had seemed impervious to other factors. In Florida, where students from Stoneman Douglas High and other schools had rallied in the state capital, the governor signed a bill last week that raised the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21 and extended the waiting period to three days. On a national level, the students have not had the same impact. This week, President Trump abandoned gun control proposals that the Republican-led Congress had never even inched toward supporting. But, for one day at least, the students commanded the country’s airwaves, Twitter feeds and Snapchat stories. Principals and superintendents seemed disinclined to stop them. Some were outright supportive, though others warned that students would face disciplinary consequences for leaving school. At many schools, teachers and parents joined in. Wreathed in symbolism, the walkouts generally lasted for 17 minutes, one for each of the Parkland victims. Two more nationwide protests are set to take place on March 24 and on April 20, the anniversary of the Columbine shooting. On a soccer field burned yellow by the Colorado sun, Ms. Tyner stood alongside hundreds of her fellow students, who waved signs — “This is our future,” one said — and released red, white and blue balloons.  Yet in many places, for many students, Wednesday was just Wednesday, and class went on. Even at Columbine, the embrace of the gun control movement was not universal. “People say it’s all about gun control, it’s all about, ‘We should ban guns,’” said Caleb Conrad, 16, a junior, who stayed in class. “But that’s not the real issue here. The real issue is the people who are doing it.” In the one-school rural community of Potosi, Wis., no student group had organized a protest. After a handful of students expressed some interest, the school decided to hold an assembly at 10 a.m. to talk about school safety measures and the value of being kind to one another. At 10 a.m., one student, a female freshman, left the building alone. Throughout the assembly, she sat by herself outside, by a flagpole, for 17 minutes. She appeared to be praying, said the principal, Mike Uppena, adding that she was not in trouble for leaving. Officials in Lafayette Parish, La., initially said that students could participate in the day’s events, believing that it was appropriate to honor the Florida victims. But when it became clear there was a political motive to the walkout, a torrent of complaints from the local community led the school board to adopt a new plan: a minute of silence. Dozens of students walked out anyway. In some places, demonstrators chanted and held signs. At other schools, students stood in silence. In Atlanta, some students took a knee. Thousands of New York City students converged on central locations — Columbus Circle, Battery Park, Brooklyn Borough Hall, Lincoln Center. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, stretched out on the sidewalk as part of a “die-in” with students in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, the former home of the Occupy Wall Street protests.  Hundreds sat in the middle of West 62nd Street for several minutes before rising to their feet and shouting, “No more violence.” A cry of “Trump Tower!” sent dozens of protesters marching toward the Trump International Hotel and Tower across Broadway. Onlookers gave them fist-bumps. In Washington, thousands left their classrooms in the city and its suburbs and marched to the Capitol steps, their high-pitched voices battling against the stiff wind: “Hey-hey, ho-ho, the N.R.A. has got to go!” One sign said: “Fix This, Before I Text My Mom from Under A Desk.” Members of Congress, overwhelmingly Democratic, emerged from the Capitol to meet them. Trailed by aides and cameras, some legislators high-fived the children in the front rows, others took selfies, and nearly all soon learned that the young protesters had no idea who they were. Except, of course, for “BERNIE SANDERS!” which the protesters screamed at the Vermont senator, as well at some other white-haired, bespectacled legislators. Asked by reporters about the walkouts, Raj Shah, Mr. Trump’s deputy press secretary, said the president “shares the students’ concerns about school safety” and cited his support for mental health and background check improvements. As the hours passed, the walkouts moved west across the country. “It’s 10 o’clock,” said a man on the intercom at Perspectives Charter Schools on Chicago’s South Side. With that, hundreds of students streamed out of their classrooms and into the neighborhood, marching past modest brick homes, a Walgreens and multiple churches. Several current and former Perspectives students have been killed in recent years, the school president said. “You see different types of violence going on,” said Armaria Broyles, a junior who helped lead the walkout and whose older brother was killed in a shooting. “We all want a good community and we all want to make a change.”  At Santa Monica High School in Southern California, teachers guided hundreds of students to the football field. It felt like a cross between a political rally and pep rally, with dozens of students wearing orange T-shirts, the color of the gun control movement, and #neveragain scrawled onto their arms in black eyeliner. “It is our duty to win,” Roger Gawne, a freshman and one of the protest organizers, yelled to the crowd. The protests calling for stricter gun control measures come on the heels of other youth movements, but the momentum they have gained makes them stand out. Although the walkouts commanded attention on cable television and social media for much of Wednesday, it also was clear that many students did not participate, especially in rural and conservative areas where gun control is not popular. At Bartlesville High School in Bartlesville, Okla., where hundreds of students walked out of class last month to protest cuts in state education funding, nothing at all happened at 10 a.m. “I haven’t heard a word about it,” the principal, LaDonna Chancellor, said of the gun protest. In Iowa, Russell Reiter, superintendent of the Oskaloosa Community School District, suggested that temperatures below 40 degrees may have encouraged students to stay indoors, but he also said that “students here are just not interested in what is going on in bigger cities.” There was opposition even in liberal Santa Monica. Just after the organizers of the walkout there read the names of the Parkland victims, another student went on stage, grabbed the microphone and shouted “Support the Second Amendment!” before he was called off by administrators. Some of the day’s most poignant demonstrations happened at schools whose names are now synonymous with shootings. Watched by a phalanx of reporters, camera operators and supporters, hundreds of students crowded onto the football field at Stoneman Douglas High shortly after 10 a.m.  A month after the Feb. 14 shooting, notes of condolence, fading flowers and stuffed toys, damp from recent rain, still lay on the grass outside the school and affixed to metal fences. The walkout was allowed by the school, but several students said they were warned that they would not be permitted back onto the campus for the day if they left school grounds. Despite the warning, a couple of hundred students marched to a nearby park for another demonstration. “We need more than just 17 minutes,” Nicolle Montgomerie, 17, a junior, said as she walked toward the park. An email from the school soon went out telling students they could return. In Newtown, Conn., where 26 people were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, hundreds of students at Newtown High School gathered in a parking lot near the football field. Two hours later, it was Columbine’s turn. Shortly after the walkouts began, the National Rifle Association said on Twitter, “Let’s work together to secure our schools and stop school violence.”

That must change. #StopSchoolViolenceAct #DefendTheSecond #NRA pic.twitter.com/98dWIv0giM         But the next tweet left no doubt as to where the N.R.A. stood on the message of the protests. It said, “I’ll control my own guns, thank you. #2A #NRA” atop a photo of an AR-15, the kind of high-powered rifle used at Stoneman Douglas High and in other mass shootings. 
            I'll control my own guns, thank you. #2A #NRA pic.twitter.com/jqbZzwcWf6         The Gun Owners of America, a smaller organization often seen as more militant than the N.R.A., was more defiant. The group urged its supporters to call their elected officials to oppose gun control measures like Fix NICS, which is intended to improve reporting by state and federal agencies to the criminal background check system. “We could win or lose the gun control battle in the next 96 hours,” the group said on Twitter.  The group also celebrated “the pro-gun students who are not supporting their anti-gun counterparts.” 
            Kudos to the pro-gun students who are not supporting their anti-gun counterparts. #NationalWalkoutDay pic.twitter.com/DyKoRHrL1n         Some schools accommodated or even encouraged the protests. But others warned that they would mark students who left as absent, or even suspend them. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     In Cobb County, Ga., near Atlanta, the threat of punishment did not keep scores of Walton High School students from standing in silence on the football field for 170 seconds. A school district spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on what would happen to the students. Noelle Ellerson Ng, associate executive director for policy and advocacy for AASA, the association of the nation’s superintendents, said that schools had to balance the First Amendment rights of students with their other responsibilities, including safety. Indeed, several protests were canceled because of threats of the same kind of violence the students were demonstrating against.

Washington,66," By ADAM GOLDMAN and PATRICIA MAZZEIFEB. 15, 2018 WASHINGTON — Last fall, a bail bondsman in Mississippi spotted a disturbing comment on his YouTube channel. “Im going to be a professional school shooter,” it read. There was nothing more. The bondsman, Ben Bennight, took a screenshot and flagged the comment to YouTube, which removed the post. Mr. Bennight then left a voice mail message at his local F.B.I. field office alerting it to the comment. A pair of agents interviewed him the next morning, Mr. Bennight said in an interview on Thursday. But he heard nothing more until Wednesday, hours after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17: The commenter’s YouTube user name, “nikolas cruz,” matched that of the suspect. Two F.B.I. agents visited Mr. Bennight and questioned him for 15 to 20 minutes. They told him they thought the person who posted on his channel might be connected to the Florida shooting because they had the same name. Nikolas Cruz, 19, has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and has confessed to the killings, the police said Thursday.  “I really don’t feel like I was any help to them at all,” said Mr. Bennight, 36. The F.B.I. is reviewing what steps the bureau took before the shooting when the agents received the initial information. The bureau conducted database reviews and open-source checks about the comment in September, Rob Lasky, the F.B.I. special agent in charge in Miami, said on Thursday.  “There was no particular information about the particular time, location or further identifiers about the person who posted the comment,” Mr. Lasky said. “No additional information was found to positively identify the person who posted this comment. There was no connection found to South Florida.” Agents are still trying to sort out what happened, but without more information and limited ability under the circumstances to obtain a subpoena, their options were few. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     Had agents sought a grand jury subpoena to obtain data from YouTube to identify the person behind the posting, it is not certain that prosecutors would have agreed to seek one based on the scant information available. Agents might have a hard time convincing prosecutors of an imminent threat because the post mentioned no time or location of a possible shooting. Even if agents had tied Mr. Cruz to the YouTube post, the authorities probably would have questioned him or his family and friends but would have been unable seize his gun without a court order. “I hope he would have been interviewed by the F.B.I. or referred to the local police assuming he was identified,” said Eugene Casey, a veteran former F.B.I. agent. “I would have done my best to identify the individual who made the threat, but he could have posted it to YouTube from a public computer in a library or somewhere else.” The case highlights the difference between how the United States government handles terrorism and other kinds of attacks. Over the past decade and a half, the F.B.I. and other agencies have established broad power to pre-emptively investigate people in matters of international terrorism — raising expectations that the government should be able to prevent attacks. “If they had gotten a tip that someone was going to shoot up the embassy in Cairo, they would have been all over it. But they don’t know what to do with it when it’s domestic,” said Chris Fialko, a prominent North Carolina defense lawyer who has handled numerous F.B.I. investigations. “We are not Big Brother yet. They have to get search warrants. In America, the Bill of Rights still applies.”  The F.B.I. is gathering information about Mr. Cruz’s social media posts, along with his movements and conversations, Mr. Lasky said. YouTube did not respond to a request for further information. Mr. Bennight said he did not fault the F.B.I. for failing to stop the shooting. “We live in a country where you can’t just lock people away for saying something,” he said. “You can’t just stuff somebody in a black hole because they said something that makes you uncomfortable. I believe the F.B.I. took it seriously. I hope that they followed up.” If the bureau missed an opportunity to prevent the shooting, it could find itself in the cross hairs of Congress, which has criticized the F.B.I. for failing to stop the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the 2009 mass shooting at Fort Hood in Texas. In the Texas attack, the shooter was known to the F.B.I., as was one of the brothers who carried out the Boston bombing. Adam Goldman reported from Washington, and Patricia Mazzei from New York.

National,67," By JACEY FORTINFEB. 16, 2018 The survivors of one of the deadliest school shootings in modern American history are still processing the attack on Wednesday in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 dead. One student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had an encounter with the shooting suspect that left him reeling. During his English class on Wednesday afternoon, Chris McKenna, 15, left to take a bathroom break. The restrooms were closed on the first floor, said Chris, a freshman, so he headed to the second floor. He found the shooting suspect, Nikolas Cruz, 19, in a stairwell between the first and second floors in the freshman building. Sitting on the stairs, Mr. Cruz was loading a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle, Chris said. Mr. Cruz appeared “shocked” when he opened the door to the stairwell, Chris said. “I don’t think he expected me to see him at all,” he said, as Mr. Cruz was loading the gun.  “He told me, ‘Better get out of here, things are about to get messy,’” Chris said. Chris, who said he did not know Mr. Cruz, left the stairwell, heading outside, where he ran into Aaron Feis, an assistant football coach and security monitor, at a school gate. After Chris told Mr. Feis what he had seen, Mr. Feis drove him in a golf cart to a baseball field about 500 feet away. Mr. Feis left him there to return to the school.      “He said, ‘Stay here.’ So I stood there for a little bit,” Chris said. Then he heard the sound of gunshots.  Chris sprinted to a nearby Walmart, where he said he called his sister, Jackie, 17, who is a senior at the high school. She told him she was hiding in a closet. “She was worried about me, and I was worried about her,” he said. Jackie survived. Mr. Feis, 37, was killed. Mr. Cruz blended in with other students to leave the school, according to the authorities, but he was arrested as he walked down a residential street at 3:41 p.m. Mr. Cruz faces 17 counts of premeditated murder. Chris said three students in his English class had died. Asked why he thought Mr. Cruz told him to leave, Chris said it seemed like a matter of timing. Mr. Cruz appeared to be occupied with loading the gun.  ",2018-02-17,0.19686384,Saturday
National,68," By ALAN BLINDER, PATRICIA MAZZEI and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.FEB. 21, 2018 CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. — The Broward County sheriff on Wednesday defended his office’s response to one of the deadliest school shootings in American history amid questions over whether some of his deputies hung back instead of pursuing the gunman accused of killing 17 people. Sheriff Scott Israel said that, to his knowledge, deputies followed protocol and did not wait for specialized teams to arrive before going into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. But he said that details over the office’s response remained unclear. “That’s exactly what we’re examining,” Sheriff Israel said, noting that active shooter protocols require confronting suspects as quickly as possible. “You don’t wait for SWAT, you get in, and you push toward the shooter.” The sheriff’s response comes a week after Nikolas Cruz was accused of opening fire at his former school with a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle and as parents, students and school administrators continue to struggle to make sense of what happened.  After the attack, Mr. Cruz slipped away on foot seven minutes after the gunfire began and was ultimately stopped by an officer from a neighboring police department.  Sheriff Israel also said that the only armed guard at Stoneman Douglas High, Deputy Scot Peterson, never discharged his gun during the shooting. “The response and actions of Deputy Peterson will be looked at and scrutinized, as will everyone’s,” Sheriff Israel said, adding that trained deputies would begin carrying rifles on school grounds. Interviews with law enforcement officers, parents and students, as well as a review of police radio traffic immediately after the shooting, make clear the widespread confusion among the authorities. Many emergency medical workers had no idea where the suspect was for at least 30 minutes after the gunfire erupted, and the authorities struggled to identify him for another 15 minutes. All the while, rescue workers tended to victims under the cover of officers with long rifles, some of whom appear to have entered the school less than 10 minutes after the gunfire began — but just after the suspect fled. For as long as 45 minutes after the shooting stopped, some students were still cowering behind locked doors, unsure if the person banging on their door was a police officer or the gunman, according to students. By the time Avril Engelhart, a 15-year-old freshman, heard the police enter the freshman building, where she was hiding inside her English classroom, maybe 10 minutes had passed since the gunman began firing, she said. “He wasn’t really shooting anymore,” she said. “We could hear them outside our door, and on the police walkie-talkie, we heard them say, ‘We have a victim down.’ And people started crying.”  To be sure, mass shootings are always chaotic and, despite the best efforts of trained police officers and emergency medical workers, the authorities often struggle with figuring out how to stop a gunman set on inflicting grievous harm in a matter of minutes. “They’re all pretty much the same in that it’s over in three to five minutes,” said Al Lamberti, Sheriff Israel’s predecessor, referring to the Columbine and Sandy Hook shootings. “We have to learn from this, just like we did from the others.” For parents and students, the whereabouts of the campus deputy has remained a troubling question. Sheriff Israel reiterated that Deputy Peterson was elsewhere on campus, but would not say where. A second deputy, assigned to Westglades Middle School adjacent to the high school, was away on training last Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office said. “Where was the only guy with a gun when this happened?” asked Karen Dietrich, a Fort Lauderdale police officer whose two sons attend Stoneman Douglas High and survived the massacre. “I realize it’s a large campus, and he may have been on the other side, I don’t know. But it would not take six minutes on a full run to get from one end to the other.”      Tim Burton, a Coral Springs police officer assigned to a nearby elementary school, responded to the shooting. He said in an interview on Wednesday that he had seen Deputy Peterson in a Stoneman Douglas High parking lot, where at least one school employee believed the gunman might be. Deputy Peterson “was seeking cover behind a concrete column leading to a stairwell,” said Officer Burton, who worried the gunman could be lurking in the lot because he heard no gunshots or screams to guide him toward the site of the shooting. Deputy Peterson, who has been in law enforcement for more than 30 years, could not be reached for comment, and no one answered the door at his home in neighboring Palm Beach County. The Broward Sheriff’s Office Deputies Association, a labor union, said Deputy Peterson has not sought representation from the association since the shooting. He remains on active duty, a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office said. Sheriff Israel, who immediately after the shooting praised his department’s response, abruptly called a news conference on Wednesday to extend plaudits to other police departments, including Coral Springs, whose officers said they were the first to arrive at the high school, which is in the neighboring city of Parkland. “I don’t know what deputies or police officers went in first, or in what order they arrived,” Sheriff Israel said. “This is a fluid investigation.”  Among the first to respond was Sgt. Jeff Heinrich, an off-duty Coral Springs police officer who was doing maintenance work on the baseball field when he heard gunfire. He saw students running, heard screams and got to work, treating a boy with a gunshot wound. He eventually grabbed a fellow officer’s extra weapon, slipped on a bullet-resistant vest and started searching the school, where his wife teaches physical education and his son is in the 11th grade. “When those shots ring out, you have a job to do,” Sergeant Heinrich said in an interview on Wednesday. “Everybody’s instinct is to go the other way. You have to fight that instinct.” The shooting at Columbine High School in 1999 fundamentally changed police protocol amid fears that a gunman or gunmen equipped with semiautomatic weapons would be capable of killing dozens of people in a matter of moments. Officers, their patrol cars now stocked with supplies like rifles, ballistic helmets and trauma care kits, are now trained to seek gunmen urgently, even if they have no backup or only limited information. Sheriff Israel, however, noted in a local television interview on Wednesday that he learned after the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting, in January 2017, that it was not always helpful for deputies to rush into an active scene. “One of the key lessons we learned from the airport was the phenomenon of self-dispatching and not allowing deputies and police officers from all over the tri-county area to just arrive haphazardly,” he told the local CBS affiliate. “People who came went to a staging area, and they were inserted into the mission in a common-sense way, and everybody had a job to do.” Not a single law enforcement officer appears to have fired their gun inside Stoneman Douglas High — an indication of how little the police could do once the suspect had fled after firing more than 100 rounds down the hallways and into four classrooms on two floors of the freshman building. The authorities said he had enough time to make it to the third floor to take off a tactical vest and drop off his weapon and high-capacity magazines in a stairwell. “There were a lot of kids screaming, officers just trying to get into doorways, trying to find not only the bad guy, but grab victims, trying to reach victims, pull them out and get them to fire-rescue as quickly as possible for transport,” recalled Sgt. Carla Kmiotek of Coral Springs, who oversees training for her department and was one of the first officers to enter the building.  As she searched the high school, she said, “I had a talk with myself, accepting that I could end up getting killed in this incident.” Sergeant Heinrich, who in 2016 arrested an armed boy at nearby Coral Springs High School, said his response to the shooting had felt automated. “This is go-time,” he said. “This is what we train for. This is what we do.” The teenager Sergeant Heinrich had begun to treat survived the shooting, but remains hospitalized. The sergeant is planning to visit on Thursday for his first meeting with him since their encounter at the school. When he goes, he will be returning the teenager’s backpack, which had been lost in the chaos. Alan Blinder reported from Coral Springs, and Richard A. Oppel Jr. and Patricia Mazzei from New York.

Business,69," By SHEERA FRENKEL and DAISUKE WAKABAYASHIFEB. 19, 2018 SAN FRANCISCO — One hour after news broke about the school shooting in Florida last week, Twitter accounts suspected of having links to Russia released hundreds of posts taking up the gun control debate. The accounts addressed the news with the speed of a cable news network. Some adopted the hashtag #guncontrolnow. Others used #gunreformnow and #Parklandshooting. Earlier on Wednesday, before the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., many of those accounts had been focused on the investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. “This is pretty typical for them, to hop on breaking news like this,” said Jonathon Morgan, chief executive of New Knowledge, a company that tracks online disinformation campaigns. “The bots focus on anything that is divisive for Americans. Almost systematically.” One of the most divisive issues in the nation is how to handle guns, pitting Second Amendment advocates against proponents of gun control. And the messages from these automated accounts, or bots, were designed to widen the divide and make compromise even more difficult.  Any news event — no matter how tragic — has become fodder to spread inflammatory messages in what is believed to be a far-reaching Russian disinformation campaign. The disinformation comes in various forms: conspiracy videos on YouTube, fake interest groups on Facebook, and armies of bot accounts that can hijack a topic or discussion on Twitter.  Those automated Twitter accounts have been closely tracked by researchers. Last year, the Alliance for Securing Democracy, in conjunction with the German Marshall Fund, a public policy research group in Washington, created a website that tracks hundreds of Twitter accounts of human users and suspected bots that they have linked to a Russian influence campaign. The researchers zeroed in on Twitter accounts posting information that was in step with material coming from well-known Russian propaganda outlets. To spot an automated bot, they looked for certain signs, like an extremely high volume of posts or content that conspicuously matched hundreds of other accounts. 
                Thirteen Russian nationals have been charged with illegally trying to disrupt the American political process through inflammatory social media posts and organized political rallies.             The researchers said they had watched as the bots began posting about the Parkland shooting shortly after it happened. Amplified by bot swarms, Russian-linked Twitter accounts tried to foment discord before and after the election. Hundreds of accounts promoted false stories about Hillary Clinton and spread articles based on leaked emails from Democratic operatives that had been obtained by Russian hackers. Facebook, Google and Twitter have, to varying degrees, announced new measures to eliminate bot accounts, and have hired more moderators to help them weed out disinformation on their platforms. But since the election, the Russian-linked bots have rallied around other divisive issues, often ones that President Trump has tweeted about. They promoted Twitter hashtags like #boycottnfl, #standforouranthem and #takeaknee after some National Football League players started kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. The automated Twitter accounts helped popularize the #releasethememo hashtag, which referred to a secret House Republican memorandum that suggested the F.B.I. and the Justice Department abused their authority to obtain a warrant to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser. The debate over the memo widened a schism between the White House and its own law enforcement agencies.  The bots are “going to find any contentious issue, and instead of making it an opportunity for compromise and negotiation, they turn it into an unsolvable issue bubbling with frustration,” said Karen North, a social media professor at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. “It just heightens that frustration and anger.” Intelligence officials in the United States have warned that malicious actors will try to spread disinformation ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. In testimony to Congress last year and in private meetings with lawmakers, social media companies promised that they will do better in 2018 than they did in 2016. But the Twitter campaign around the Parkland shooting is an example of how Russian operatives are still at it. The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.     “We’ve had more than a year to get our act together and address the threat posed by Russia and implement a strategy to deter future attacks, but I believe, unfortunately, we still don’t have a comprehensive plan,” said Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, during a hearing this month on global threats to the United States. “What we’re seeing is a continuous assault by Russia to target and undermine our democratic institutions, and they’re going to keep coming at us.” When the Russian bots jumped on the hashtag #Parklandshooting — initially created to spread news of the shooting — they quickly stoked tensions. Exploiting the issue of mental illness in the gun control debate, they propagated the notion that Nikolas Cruz, the suspected gunman, was a mentally ill “lone killer.” They also claimed that he had searched for Arabic phrases on Google before the shooting. Simultaneously, the bots started other hashtags, like #ar15, for the semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting, and #NRA. The bots’ behavior follows a pattern, said Mr. Morgan, one of the researchers who worked with the German Marshall Fund to create Hamilton 68, the website that monitors Russian bot and fake Twitter activity. The bots target a contentious issue like race relations or guns. They stir the pot, often animating both sides and creating public doubt in institutions like the police or media. Any issue associated with extremist views is a ripe target. The goal is to push fringe ideas into the “slightly more mainstream,” Mr. Morgan said. If well-known people retweet the bot messages or simply link to a website the bots are promoting, the messages gain an edge of legitimacy. An indictment made public on Friday by Mr. Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the election mentioned a Russian Twitter feed, @TEN_GOP, which posed as a Tennessee Republican account and attracted more than 100,000 followers. Messages from this now-deleted account were retweeted by the president’s sons and close advisers including Kellyanne Conway and Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser.  The indictment also described how fraudulent Russian accounts on Twitter tried to push real Americans into action. The indictment said the fake Twitter account @March_for_Trump had organized political rallies for Mr. Trump in New York before the election, including a “March for Trump” rally on June 25, 2016, and a “Down With Hillary” gathering on July 23, 2016. By Friday morning, the bots that pushed the original tweets around the Parkland shooting had moved on to the hashtag #falseflag — a term used by conspiracy theorists to refer to a secret government operation that is carried out to look like something else — with a conspiracy theory that the shooting had never happened. By Monday, the bots had new targets: the Daytona 500 auto race in Daytona Beach, Fla., and news about William Holleeder, a man facing trial in the Netherlands for his suspected role in six gangland killings. It is unclear why. Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi and Sheera Frenkel on Twitter: @daiwaka and @sheeraf.

National,70," By MATTHEW HAAG and SERGE F. KOVALESKIFEB. 14, 2018 For the latest on the Florida school shooting, read our Thursday live updates. The man suspected of opening fire inside a Florida high school on Wednesday, killing at least 17 people, is a former student who had been expelled for disciplinary reasons, the authorities said. Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward County, Fla., said that the man, Nikolas Cruz, 19, previously attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland but was expelled after getting into trouble. He was enrolled at another Broward County school, officials said. On Thursday, the authorities charged Mr. Cruz with 17 counts of premeditated murder. In the hours after the shooting, people who knew Mr. Cruz described him as a “troubled kid” who enjoyed showing off his firearms, bragging about killing animals and whose mother would resort to calling the police to have them come to their home to try to talk some sense into him. At a school with about 3,000 students, Mr. Cruz stayed to himself and had few friends but struck fear in some students with erratic behavior and an affinity for violence. Nikolas Cruz, shown with a public defender, was ordered to be held in jail without bond. “He always had guns on him,” the student, who did not give his name, told WFOR-TV. “The crazy stuff that he did was not right for school, and he got kicked out of school multiple times for that kind of stuff.” Jim Gard, a math teacher at Stoneman Douglas High School, said in an interview that Mr. Cruz was a student in his class during the first semester of the 2016-17 school year. In the class, he was quiet and not disruptive, Mr. Gard said. But he recalled that school administrators became concerned last year about Mr. Cruz’s behavior and alerted the faculty. “We received emails about him from the administration,” Mr. Gard said in an interview, adding that he did not recall the specific issues. 
                A gunman armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifle and “countless magazines” killed at least 17 people at his former high school on Wednesday.             After the shooting on Wednesday, Mr. Gard said that several students told him that Mr. Cruz was taken with a girl at Stoneman Douglas High School “to the point of stalking her.” In the interview with the Miami news station, the student said Mr. Cruz was a junior at Stoneman Douglas High School when he was expelled last year. He said that students would joke that if anyone were to open fire inside the school, it would be Mr. Cruz. Because of that, students feared him and mostly stayed away from him, the student said. “A lot of people were saying that it would be him,” the student told WFOR-TV. “They would say he would be the one to shoot up the school. Everyone predicted it.” 
                Since 26 people were killed in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, a nonprofit that tracks school shootings has recorded five a month, on average.             Brandon Minoff, a student at Stoneman Douglas High School, said in an interview with CNN that a teacher assigned him to work with Mr. Cruz on a group project two years ago. Mr. Cruz was quiet in class but opened up during their project, Mr. Minoff said, telling him that he had been kicked out of two private schools, had been held back twice and aspired to join the military. “He was always to himself and never tried to associate himself with anyone,” Mr. Minoff said. “As far as I know, he didn’t have any friends.” School officials declined to say why Mr. Cruz no longer attended Douglas High School. But Amanda Samaroo, whose daughter, Elizabeth, attended the school while he was a student there, said he had been expelled for bringing knives on campus. “Her friends have said he was known to always be mentally ill and would kill animals,” Ms. Samaroo said. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     Helen Pasciolla, who is retired, lives on an elegant street in the Pine Tree Estates development in Parkland, three houses down and across from where the Cruz family resided until about a year ago. Ms. Pasciolla said that Mr. Cruz told her that the family had to move out of their one-story beige house and sell it because they could no longer afford it. She said that Mr. Cruz has a brother, Zachary, and that both boys were adopted. Their adoptive father died some years ago, she added. Ms. Pasciolla said that the boys’ mother, Lynda Cruz, had regular problems with their behavior. On occasion, she said, the mother would resort to calling the police to have them come over to try to talk some sense into her sons. “I think she wanted to scare them a little bit,” Ms. Pasciolla said. “Nikolas has behavioral problems, I think, but I never thought he would be violent.” When she saw his picture on TV on Wednesday after the shooting, Ms. Pasciolla said that she thought to herself, “Oh, my God, that’s the kid who lived down the street.” Sheriff Israel said that the authorities did not yet know the motive for the killing, but were learning more about Mr. Cruz through his social media pages, which he described as “very, very concerning.” Screen shots of an Instagram page said to belong to Mr. Cruz show many photos of a man holding firearms and ammunition used in a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle. One photo shows several guns, including rifles with scopes, lying on a bed. Another appears to show a frog that had been killed. After Mr. Cruz left Douglas High School, he took a job at a Dollar Tree store about a mile and a half from the school. A person who answered the phone at the store on Wednesday evening said that Mr. Cruz worked as a cashier and was well liked by his colleagues. “He was a great guy,” the person said. He added that he last saw Mr. Cruz about a year ago before he transferred to another Dollar Tree store closer to his home. Another student at Douglas High School, Ocean Parodie, told The Daily Beast that he visited the store after Mr. Cruz was expelled to check on him. “He said he was expelled and was happy that he was thrown out,” Mr. Parodie said. “I felt bad for him.” C.J.

National,71," Supported by By Stephanie Saul and Anemona Hartocollis It started last month as a writing exercise on the 1963 Birmingham Children’s Crusade, when more than 1,000 students skipped school and marched to demand civil rights. Then the class assignment mushroomed into a plan — hatched by 10- and 11-year-olds — to stage a little civil disobedience of their own. So on Wednesday morning, the students in Craig Sampsell’s fifth-grade class at Case Elementary School in Akron, Ohio, will pick up posters they drew and walk out of their classrooms, joining many thousands of other students in a nationwide protest against gun violence after the killing of 17 people in a Florida high school last month. Asked whether that was an appropriate age to be protesting about a disturbing event, the principal, Danjile Henderson, said: “My fifth-grade students were very aware of the details of the events and wanted to have their own peaceful protest.” Still, she drew lines around who could participate and how. Third through fifth graders may walk out; second graders can observe, but not walk; kindergartners and first-grade students will remain in class for discussions on school safety in general that avoid the shooting itself. “Not all parents may want that detailed conversation on what happened in Florida,” Ms. Henderson said. With some parents wanting their children to get firsthand exposure to a nationwide political demonstration; others worried that the protests are stoking the fears of young children about a threat that remains uncommon; and still others objecting to the gun-control message entirely, one question has been weighing heavily on school administrators this past week: How young is too young for children to join the walkout? Many districts and schools that are tolerating, if not encouraging, participation in what organizers call the National School Walkout are also calibrating their approach for their youngest students. In New York City, middle and high school students may walk out of class with approval from a parent, such as with a permission slip, but elementary school students cannot leave unless a parent or guardian comes to check them out. At Woods Cross Elementary School in Woods Cross, Utah, students will be allowed to leave class at 10 a.m. and go to the gym for 17 minutes, the same starting time and duration (one minute for every victim in Parkland, Fla.) as other walkouts around the country. Parents may also check them out of the school during that time, and they will not be penalized. “We’re giving them an opportunity to express their First Amendment rights in a safe place,” said Rachel Peterson, a physical education teacher at the school who is also safety commissioner for the state board of the Utah PTA. In suburban Nashville, David L. Snowden, director of schools for the Franklin Special School District, sent an email to families saying that the district had decided that it would not be appropriate for students in its elementary schools, which run through fourth grade, to participate in the walkout, but that students in grades five and up could join. In an interview, Dr. Snowden said he was not concerned that very young children would be frightened by the walkout, only that they would not understand what it was about. “Sometimes I think when you’re teaching children, especially younger children, you try to take into consideration, will there be a full understanding of what they’re doing and why they’re doing it,” he said. “Just to walk out of class for 17 minutes, I’m not sure what that is really teaching.” Even within Akron’s 50-school district, agendas for Wednesday differed markedly from school to school. At Firestone Park Elementary, students were expected to read a poem about peace. At Pfeiffer Elementary, students would be reviewing safety procedures. And at Robinson Community Learning Center there were no plans at all — students had not expressed an interest, according to the district. Elise Cappella, a clinical psychologist and associate professor at New York University’s Steinhardt School, said there was a difference between what the youngest students — from kindergarten to second grade — and older children could understand. While not advocating any particular stance, she said: “Schools could make the decision that kids in kindergarten through second grade are not provided the opportunity to walk out. They are cognitively, socially, emotionally younger. They may feel more fear about it and less understanding.” Children in the third grade and up, she said, will be more likely to be exposed to news and hear their parents talking about it. “They are reaching a point where having something that’s potentially positive and productive to do that makes them feel a sense of agency and safety could be a good thing,” she said. Ms. Cappella said that whether elementary schools decided to participate in the protest or not, the goal should be to project a sense of community to their students. “And if you can create that space,” she said, “whether that’s in the classroom or in the hallways or in the schoolyard or out at a protest or a march, that’s the most beneficial space for young kids to be in.” Some school districts are trying to discourage any type of school walkout, regardless of age, warning that any student who participates will be marked as absent from class or even disciplined. In Sayreville, N.J., where students have been threatened with suspension if they walk out, the president of the school board, Kevin Ciak, said at a meeting last month that “if we decide that we open this door, we open this door to allow students to basically walk out and protest anything.” Barbara P. Canavan, the schools superintendent in Harford County, Md., said that a walkout “presents, paradoxically, a threat to student safety, as word of the walkout has been widely disseminated and students who go outside could become more vulnerable.” Instead, Ms. Canavan said, her district would offer “a learning module that will provide students with an opportunity to share their feelings about recent events across the nation and will allow them to speak about solutions in a structured way.” The American Civil Liberties Union, which has offered training to students planning to participate in the walkouts, said that districts can discipline students under attendance guidelines. “But what they can’t do,” the A.C.L.U. wrote in a guide for student protesters, “is discipline you more harshly because of the political nature of or the message behind your action.” Even some schools where demonstrations are being allowed are being careful about the tone. Ms. Peterson, of Woods Cross in Utah, said that there was no program planned for the assembly — the students would be able to express themselves as long as they were not rowdy or disruptive. “We are teachers and not necessarily there to make a political statement in that time,” she said. “Whatever is decided by students in that time and space, we will allow it to happen as long as it is peaceable and respectful.” If some students who stayed behind expressed surprise or bafflement at their classmates leaving the room, she said, teachers would use their own tact and judgment about how to explain it. “The way I would word it is that some kids are walking out to show support for lessening school violence, in honor of the people in Florida,” Ms. Peterson said. But in Alexandria, Va., when one school decided that fifth graders could join the walkout if their parents signed them out, a parent lodged her own form of protest. “My elementary school has 5-year-olds in it,” the parent, Julie Gunlock, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Independent Women’s Forum, said in an interview. “Some of my friends, their kids are much younger than a fifth grader. And it’s frightening to them.” Maeva Lile, 11, one of the fifth-grade organizers at Case Elementary in Akron, said that most of her friends were aware of the gun-control debate and thought that AR-15s, the powerful rifle used in Parkland and other mass shootings, should not be legal. But she said her class did not want to debate the Second Amendment, and so its posters will simply honor the students killed in Parkland with their names. Still, she thought it was time for children to do something. “Adults have been protesting against things,” she said on Monday, “but nothing has changed that much.” Kate Taylor and Alan Blinder contributed reporting.

Opinion,72," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Brian Mast The most important and unregrettable time of my life was the 12 years I spent in the Army. I became a bomb technician because I wanted to save lives. I nearly gave my own life for that — I lost both my legs and a finger when a roadside bomb detonated beneath me — and have known more heroes than I can count who died defending others. When I was with others on the battlefield and we saw a chance to save a life, we didn’t have a meeting about it; we acted immediately. I never worried about becoming a casualty myself. Now, as a Republican congressman from Florida, I don’t fear becoming a political casualty, either. If we act now by changing laws surrounding firearms and mental illness, we too can save lives. Most nights in Afghanistan, I wielded an M4 carbine and a .40-caliber pistol. The total barrel length of my M4 was approximately 14 inches with Trijicon ACOG sights, as well as an infrared laser. I usually carried 10 magazines stacked with 20 rounds of 5.56-millimeter ammunition each. My rifle was very similar to the AR-15-style semiautomatic weapon used to kill students, teachers and a coach I knew at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where I once lived. I have fired tens of thousands of rounds through that rifle, many in combat. We used it because it was the most lethal — the best for killing our enemies. And I know that my community, our schools and public gathering places are not made safer by any person having access to the best killing tool the Army could put in my hands. I cannot support the primary weapon I used to defend our people being used to kill children I swore to defend. The truth is, most gun owners are responsible sportsmen and collectors who enjoy shooting recreationally, like me, or want to protect their home in the way they see fit. I am a longtime member of the National Rifle Association. My grandfather bought me my first NRA membership when I was young, and I have the same pride he and many Americans feel at being responsible gun owners, becoming excellent marksmen and joining in the camaraderie of hunting. We are Americans and we like to be the best; we should never lose this trait. The AR-15 is an excellent platform for recreational shooters to learn to be outstanding marksmen. Unfortunately, it is also an excellent platform for those who wish to kill the innocent. I conceal and carry a 9-millimeter pistol most days because I know the threats, and I don’t want to die because I am unprepared to return fire. I also know that I am made less safe by the threat of tactical rifles. I am confident I can eliminate an active shooter who is attacking with a pistol because the attacker would have to be close to me. But the defense my concealed 9-millimeter affords me is largely gone if the attacker is firing from beyond 40 yards, as he could easily do with the AR-15. No firearm is evil. Guns are tools that fulfill the intent of their users, good or bad. But we’ve seen that the rifle of choice for many mass shooters is the AR-15. The Second Amendment is unimpeachable. It guarantees the right of citizens to defend themselves. I accept, however, that it does not guarantee that every civilian can bear any and all arms. For example, the purchase of fully automatic firearms is largely banned already, and I cannot purchase an AT-4 rocket, grenades, a Bradley fighting vehicle or an Abrams tank. I know that no single action can prevent a truly determined person from committing mass murder, and I am aware of other ways to commit mass murder, such as bombings and mass vehicular slaughter. Not being able to control everything, however, should not prevent us from doing something. Therefore, I support the following: Defining what constitutes an assault or tactical firearm and not allowing them for future purchase — just as we already prohibit the purchase of fully automatic firearms. The exact definition of assault weapon will need to be determined. But we should all be able to agree that the civilian version of the very deadly weapon that the Army issued to me should certainly qualify. I would not support any version of a ban that results in confiscating existing legally owned firearms. Ensuring that every firearm purchaser has a background check. We also need to improve the background check system. Banning the sale of accessories and add-ons that circumvent the ban on automatic firearms, and increasing the ages at which individuals can purchase various categories of firearms. Ensuring that those who have been detained for mental illness, or have been ordered by courts to receive treatment for mental illness, cannot purchase firearms. Ensuring that someone who is being looked at as a possible terrorist, through a system of due process, cannot purchase a firearm and that any person threatening to shoot or blow up a school, in word or on social media, is placed on an F.B.I. watch list for a long time. Providing behavior detection training to anyone seeking a Federal Firearms License. Making substantial resources available to schools, at their discretion, for security measures, including the opportunity to purchase enhanced security screening, install classroom panic buttons wired directly to law enforcement and hire additional school resource officers. Holding the F.B.I. and state agencies accountable for their failures to identify a threat like Nikolas Cruz, as well as ensuring that schools enforce basic security protocols to prevent access by unauthorized personnel. And finally, conducting further research into the nexus of gun violence, violence in mass media and mental illness. The president, House of Representatives, Senate, every state legislature, sheriffs, police officers, school boards, students and parents must unite with one mission: that no one will ever be murdered in school again.

National,73," By PATRICIA MAZZEIFEB. 25, 2018 MIAMI — Facing mounting questions on Sunday over how his officers handled a mass shooting in a high school, Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward County, Fla., defended his actions as “amazing leadership.” Sheriff Israel, a Democrat in an elected post, said he would not resign over the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, which left 17 people dead. His current term runs through 2020. On Sunday, the speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and dozens of other Republican lawmakers called on Gov. Rick Scott, also a Republican, to use his authority to suspend the sheriff from office. The governor’s office announced on Sunday that state officials would conduct an investigation of the law enforcement response to the shooting. The Broward County Sheriff’s office said it welcomed the governor’s move and would cooperate with the investigation.  In a tense interview on CNN on Sunday, Sheriff Israel said he should not be held responsible for the armed deputy assigned to the school, who failed to enter the building while the shooting was in progress on Feb. 14.  “Deputies make mistakes,” the sheriff said on the program, “State of the Union.” “Police officers make mistakes. But it’s not the responsibility of a general or the president if you have a deserter.” Sheriff Israel added: “you don’t measure a person’s leadership by a deputy not going in.” “I’ve given amazing leadership to this agency,” he said. Sheriff Israel revealed on Thursday, citing video from school surveillance cameras, that the deputy, Scot Peterson, had taken cover outside the school building for four minutes while the suspected gunman, Nikolas Cruz, was shooting students and staff members. Deputy Peterson resigned on Thursday after being placed under internal investigation. The sheriff acknowledged on Sunday that the deputy’s inaction might have cost lives. “Do I believe if Scot Peterson went into that building, there was a chance he could have neutralized the killer and saved lives? Yes, I believe that,” he told the host of the program, Jake Tapper. Deputy Peterson’s actions are not the only ones in question. The sheriff’s office is also investigating whether other deputies who arrived on the scene failed to enter the high school immediately. Officers from the Coral Springs Police Department, who were the first to respond to the shooting, told CNN that at least three Broward County deputies had hung back during the response. Standard police protocol for dealing with an active shooter requires officers to try to confront the shooters as quickly as possible. Sheriff Israel said on Sunday that his deputies arrived four minutes after Mr. Cruz had left the freshman building where the massacre took place. But Mr. Tapper noted that the deputies did not know at that point that Mr. Cruz had already left, and should have proceeded as though the shooting were still underway. “We will investigate every action of our deputies, of their supervisors,” the sheriff said, adding that Coral Springs police officers will give witness statements to investigators from his office. “If they did things wrong,” he said of his department’s personnel, “I will take care of business in a disciplinary manner.”      Sheriff Israel, who effusively praised his deputies in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, had insisted in a news conference on Wednesday that his deputies had not delayed their entry into the school. He appeared at a town-hall-style event that evening, broadcast on CNN, during which he criticized the National Rifle Association aggressively and urged state lawmakers to give police more power to commit the mentally ill to hospitals involuntarily. He did not mention Deputy Peterson’s inaction on that broadcast, even though, as he told Mr. Tapper on Sunday, he had seen video footage earlier that day showing that the deputy had stayed outside.  The sheriff said on Sunday that his office waited until Thursday, the day after the broadcast, to corroborate that the deputy had not entered the school and to notify families of the victims about the finding. “I’m not on a timeline for TV or any news show,” he said. Sheriff Israel said he has asked the Police Executive Research Forum, based in Washington, to conduct an independent after-action report on how his office responded to the shooting. He rejected suggestions that his office had missed repeated signs that Mr. Cruz was a threat to Stoneman Douglas High, even though at least 23 calls involving Mr. Cruz were made to deputies over the past decade. The sheriff’s office is investigating how two of those calls were handled, and has placed the two deputies who responded to them on restricted duty. Sheriff Israel indicated that he was unaware until after the shooting that there had been a long list of calls directly involving Mr. Cruz. “I can only take responsibility for what I knew about,” the sheriff said. Almost none of the incidents involved offenses that would merit an arrest, he said, adding: “our deputies did everything right.” “Our deputies have done amazing things,” he said. The state house speaker, Richard Corcoran, wrote to the governor on Sunday, asking him to remove the sheriff from office for “incompetence and neglect of duty.” “Sheriff Israel failed to maintain a culture of alertness, vigilance and thoroughness,” Mr. Corcoran wrote. The speaker’s letter followed one sent on Saturday by Representative Bill Hager, a Republican from Boca Raton similarly asking the governor to remove the sheriff. Sheriff Israel dismissed Mr. Hager’s request in the CNN interview. “It was a shameful, politically motivated letter that had no facts,” Sheriff Israel said. “And of course I won’t resign.” Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.

National,74," By LIAM STACKFEB. 20, 2018 The actor George Clooney and his wife, Amal, a human rights lawyer, said Tuesday that they would donate $500,000 to a nationwide protest against gun violence planned next month by teenage survivors of a Florida high school shooting, inspiring similar gifts from other big-name Hollywood figures. In a statement, the couple said they were “so inspired by the courage and eloquence of these young men and women” from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The police say the suspect — a 19-year-old former student, Nikolas Cruz — killed 17 people in a rampage with a semiautomatic weapon there last week. “Our family will be there on March 24 to stand side by side with this incredible generation of young people from all over the country,” the Clooneys said. “And in the name of our children, Ella and Alexander, we’re donating 500,000 dollars to help pay for this groundbreaking event.” “Our children’s lives depend on it,” they added. The survivors of the Stoneman Douglas school shooting have emerged as influential new voices in the gun debate, urging lawmakers to adopt new gun control measures in protests outside schools and national television appearances that have been shared widely online.  After the Clooneys made their announcement, other Hollywood leaders said they would match their donation to help the March for Our Lives, including the producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife, Marilyn, Oprah Winfrey, and Steven Spielberg and his wife, Kate Capshaw.  “These inspiring young people remind me of the Freedom Riders of the 60s who also said we’ve had ENOUGH and our voices will be heard,” Ms. Winfrey said on Twitter. 
            George and Amal, I couldn’t agree with you more. I am joining forces with you and will match your $500,000 donation to ‘March For Our Lives.’ These inspiring young people remind me of the Freedom Riders of the 60s who also said we’ve had ENOUGH and our voices will be heard.         Sarah Chadwick, 16, one of the students organizing the nationwide protest, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that she and other organizers were “so appreciative” of what the Clooneys had done. Plans for the march were announced over the weekend. “Five hundred thousand dollars. That’s not pocket change,” Ms. Chadwick, a junior, said. “That’s a lot of money, and we’re so thankful he donated it to our cause.” In their statement, the Katzenbergs said: “We will join Amal and George Clooney on March 24 to stand alongside these remarkable young people. We are also donating $500,000 to March for Our Lives to support this historic event.”      In announcing their $500,000 donation, Mr. Spielberg and Ms. Capshaw said, “The young students in Florida and now across the country are already demonstrating their leadership with a maturity that belies their ages.” Mr. and Mrs. Clooney’s announcement came six months after they donated $1 million, through their Clooney Foundation for Justice, to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization in Montgomery, Ala., that tracks extremist groups. Stan Rosenfield, a spokesman for Mr. Clooney, said the couple’s donation on Tuesday was made by them personally and did not come from their foundation. Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles, and Matthew Haag and Daniel Victor from New York.

Opinion,75," Supported by The Conversation By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens Gail Collins: Bret, the Olympics are over and Congress is back. Which would you like to talk about first? Bret Stephens: What I’d really like to talk about is that you are the winner of this year’s Polk Award for commentary, which put a huge smile on all of your colleagues’ faces and gives me a chance to make you blush at the outset of our conversation. Gail: Aw, thanks. Consider me blushing. Bret: O.K., let’s talk about ... the Olympics. I think the double luge is amazing and curling is not. I think Lindsey Vonn is an inspiration to women everywhere and Ivanka Trump is not. I think Chloe Kim is awesome and Mike Pence is not. Gail: Fair on all counts. I do think it’s interesting that once every four years the world devotes a certain amount of time to serious thinking about curling. I have to admit I miss the old TV version of the Olympics, where you’d have little back stories on the players’ previous issues with substance abuse, the very bad breakup the hockey goalie had with the luge guy — all the gossip. And then reporters running all over looking for stories, which were usually about somebody claiming someone else was cheating. Of course it’s better to have our athletes be virtuous and spend their time doing warm-up exercises and tweeting to their fans. Just seems sort of … dull. Obviously I have a bad character. Bret: Obviously. I’m mainly relieved that the Olympics came off without a war starting on the Korean Peninsula. Although maybe it’s premature to say that. Just after the last Winter Olympics, in Sochi, Vladimir Putin marched into Crimea. Don’t be shocked if Kim Jong-un was taking notes. I guess we also shouldn’t be shocked that Ivanka stonewalled a question from Peter Alexander of the Today Show about whether she believed her father’s denials of sexual misconduct. She said “it’s a pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter.” What do you think? Gail: It would be pretty inappropriate to ask a daughter who wasn’t a member of the administration. Bret: Wait, you mean that Ivanka Trump shouldn’t play the daughter card while she’s in South Korea meeting the country’s president and representing the United States? That’s so 2015 of you. But go on. Gail: Blocking the kids out of my mind. Will not even mention Junior mixing business with — government — in India. Let’s move on to Congress. House and Senate skulking back into action — or whatever you call what it is they do. Doesn’t look as if there’ll be any action on guns, does it? Bret: Not while Republicans are in control. The president has spoken about raising the age limit for the purchase of assault rifles to 21, along with a ban on so-called bump stocks, which are devices that help increase the rate of fire. The N.R.A. seems broadly opposed to both, however, so that’s a nonstarter. And I don’t think Trump is going to expend much political capital on getting the G.O.P. to change its mind, either. Which is a tragedy, given the number of future mass shootings we can expect, considering how many past ones we’ve endured. Gail: Yeah, if it hurts gun business, it’s toast. Like the N.R.A. folk, Trump lives in an alternate universe where being armed means always being capable of hitting somebody in a crisis situation. And of course the president himself would have run right into that school the second he heard gunfire, armed or not. Because that’s just the kind of guy he is. I think we should start by challenging him to hit the side of a barn. Bret: In an alternative universe, Trump might have been the president with the popular clout to oppose the rank-and-file G.O.P. on the positions worth opposing — like the ones the party has on guns and abortion rights — while not opposing it on the positions worth preserving, like its past friendliness toward free trade and immigration. But since he’s incapable of broadening his base, he’s going to become ever more dependent on its hardest and most extreme core. Gail: Yeah, remember when we thought he might be someplace between Mitt Romney and Bernie Sanders? As opposed to where we find him now, which is someplace between a weekend replacement talking head on Fox and a professional wrestling villain. But about guns — you may be more radical than I am, given that you want to repeal the Second Amendment, while I’d be thrilled if we could just prohibit gun dealers from selling caches of weapons across state lines. I just can’t summon the energy to talk about changing the Constitution. When was the last success — 1992? And it was to ban Congress from getting a pay raise until after an election had passed. Which had originally been submitted for ratification in 1789. Wahoo. Bret: I don’t think of my proposal as radical at all. I think of it as the essence of conservatism, coming from someone who sees himself as a strict constructionist. The Constitution provides, in Article V, a method for amending itself. Let’s use it! Let’s use it to repeal an amendment that, having left us awash in 300,000,000 firearms, is defeating the larger purposes of the Constitution as they are spelled out in the preamble: to “insure domestic tranquillity”; to “promote the general welfare”; and to “secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.” What is “posterity” for the parents of the children massacred in Parkland, Fla.? Where are the “blessings of liberty” for those who were mowed down at a concert in Las Vegas? Where is the “domestic tranquillity” for the relatives of the 11,000 people murdered with a firearm in 2016? Gail: I applaud your sentiments. You’re absolutely right — I’m just sadly realistic. Bret: Some of my liberal friends think that repealing the Second Amendment is a pipe dream, and we should focus on more achievable goals like reversing the Supreme Court’s 2008 Heller decision and instituting a ban on the AR-15-style rifle, which was used by the killers in Parkland and Vegas. I’m skeptical. The United States had a huge gun problem long before Heller. And most firearm violence is done with handguns, not rifles. We need, at the very least, to start talking about root causes and not just symptoms. Questioning the relevance and legitimacy of the Second Amendment is what the N.R.A. most fears, which is why I’m going on about it. Gail: Bless you. And the fight must continue. Just because I’m sure Congress will punt on guns doesn’t mean I don’t really, really believe we have to change. The other thing our lawmakers are supposed to do is pass appropriations, although I guess they’ll kick the can down the road with some kind of just-keep-going bill. I am very worried about the whole spending situation. This administration is stripping so many good programs out of existence, from family planning to preserving whooping cranes. Do you have any worries on that front? Bret: Hadn’t heard about the whooping crane, which, for the record, I’m emphatically in favor of preserving as a safe and thriving species. I guess I’d make two points here. One is that mandatory spending on things like Social Security and Medicare keeps rising as a percentage of overall spending. Last I checked, it amounted to more than half of federal outlays, if you take Medicare to stand for mandatory health care spending generally. So the programs you mentioned are inevitably going to be on the endangered list, especially in an administration that wants to spend more of its discretionary dollars on defense. As I do. Gail: We need to spend a whole conversation on military spending sometime soon. Let me just hint at my position by whispering: Monumental. Amounts. Of. Waste. Bret: Uh oh, we might remind readers there are things we really do disagree about! Wasteful or not, I think Democrats should get behind some version of entitlement reform, to liberate, for the long term, some of the budget for priorities like the ones you mentioned. Gail: Putting entitlements on the must-take-up-in-future list, too. Only whispering that we could start by lifting the cap on the payroll tax. Bret: Or raising the retirement age and block-granting Medicaid. (Cue the evil cackle.) Anyway, my second point is that if liberals want to preserve those programs, they need to start acting more like a normal political opposition and less like “the resistance.” We hear too much from Democrats about how awful the president is, as if he doesn’t do a fine job by himself of proving the same point. We don’t hear nearly enough about the Democratic tax plan, infrastructure investment ideas and so on. I know there’s probably a paper on a D.N.C. website somewhere, but it’s not what the party is talking about. And it’s what people need to hear. Gail: I have faith that we’re going to get more of that kind of conversation when we get actual candidates running for president. Until then I hang my head and admit you’re right. Onward and upward, Bret. Save the whooping cranes. Bret: And another hurray for you, Gail, for a truly magnificent and well-deserved achievement. Blush away.

Opinion,76," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Erica Goode Five years ago, shortly after the elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn., I visited a program in Los Angeles aimed at heading off school shootings before they occurred. What I learned was both terrifying and encouraging. High schools and colleges, it turned out, were rife with troubled students who expressed violent thoughts. One scribbled “Kill Everyone Leave None Alive” in a notebook beside drawings of bombs hitting a building that looked disturbingly like a school. Another posted pictures of himself on Facebook holding guns alongside the words “School — Tomorrow.” A third student said that Adam Lanza, the Newtown shooter, had done a good thing in killing those 20 children by enabling them to escape the travails of life. But I also realized that mental health experts, law enforcement agencies and criminal justice researchers had learned a great deal about how to identify potential perpetrators of school violence, how to assess whether the threats were real — a vast majority are not — and how to intervene. With at least 17 people dead at a high school in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday and 40 school shootings recorded in the United States since 2000, it is worth paying attention to what this knowledge is. Studies have shown, for example, that in school shootings, the killers virtually always “leak” their intentions, leaving a trail of clues behind them. Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old who the police said has confessed in the Parkland shooting, apparently was no exception: Students reportedly avoided him and joked that if anyone were going to shoot up the school, it would be him. Researchers have also found that in many, if not most, cases of school violence, the perpetrator has done extensive research on previous school shootings, studying them in detail, often with special attention to the killings at Columbine High School in 1999. A study of nine school shootings in Europe conducted by J. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist in San Diego who consults on threat assessment for schools and corporations, found that a third of the killers had “consciously imitated and emulated what had happened in Columbine.” Finally, there is nascent, but increasing, evidence that violence begets violence, with one school shooting — especially if it receives a lot of publicity — leading to others, a phenomenon that researchers refer to as “contagion.” And some psychologists believe that news media reports of mass killings may propel people who are already at risk of violence into committing copycat crimes. Violence is, of course, notoriously difficult to predict, and no one thinks that all school shootings can be prevented. Yet experts in assessing threats say that there are approaches that in some cases can be effective in derailing a planned act of violence. Improved communication among agencies authorized to detect and prevent violence is one promising strategy. In many areas where there are coordinated threat assessment systems in place, barriers to such communication have been dismantled to reduce the chances that a student who is “on a path to violence” will fall through the cracks. But few localities have as comprehensive a system as I saw in Los Angeles County, where law enforcement, the county mental health department and educational institutions share information and train staff members to recognize and report worrisome behavior. Students, teachers and parents are encouraged to report any troubling behavior. When a threat appears potentially serious, mental health workers and law enforcement officers might visit a student’s home, talk to the parents and even ask if they can see the student’s room. Tony Beliz, a consultant to schools and corporations on violence prevention who for many years ran the mental health side of the Los Angeles program, which was started by the Los Angeles Police Department, has noted that parents often have no idea what their children are up to. I n more than a few cases, a team visiting a home has found weapons or other indications of deadly intention. School shootings are rare events, and account for only a tiny fraction of gun-related deaths each year. Still, many experts believe that it should be far more difficult for severely troubled teenagers to get hold of weapons like the semiautomatic AR-15 used in the Parkland, Fla., attack. In California, disturbed teenagers who seem seriously bent on violence can sometimes be committed to a psychiatric hospital for 72 hours of observation, an action that then allows any firearms they possess to be legally seized. In other states, it is not so easy. Educating local clinics, school psychologists and teachers about laws governing the release of privileged communication can improve the chances of identifying potentially dangerous students. Many educators and mental health professionals believe that they cannot disclose troubling confidences, even if they believe that there might be a threat to public safety. But this is not the case. Dr. Meloy, the forensic psychologist, and other experts think the media can also do more to prevent mass shootings. He does not expect news outlets to forgo covering school shootings. But, Dr. Meloy says, reporters and editors could avoid describing a killer using words that might “convey a certain cool pose” to some teenagers, including “lone wolf” or even “school shooter.” “From the perspective of a young male, being a school shooter is something that can be idealized, and it brings a coolness to the behavior that otherwise does not exist in his life,” Dr. Meloy told me. After my trip five years ago, I wrote a story about the Los Angeles program and others like it and left feeling hopeful that even if our society can’t stop school shootings altogether, we can certainly reduce their frequency. The horrific shooting in Parkland raises the question of whether we are serious about trying. Erica Goode, a former New York Times reporter, is a visiting professor at the S.I.

National,77," By ALAN BLINDER and PATRICIA MAZZEIFEB. 22, 2018 Updated, Feb. 24, 2018: The Broward County Sheriff’s Office said it was investigating whether other deputies from the department did not go into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School to engage the gunman. FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — The only armed sheriff’s deputy at a Florida high school where 17 people were killed took cover outside rather than charging into the building when the massacre began, the Broward County sheriff said on Thursday. The sheriff also acknowledged that his office received 23 calls related to the suspect going back a decade, including one last year that said he was collecting knives and guns, but may not have adequately followed up. The deputy, Scot Peterson, resigned on Thursday after being suspended without pay after Sheriff Scott Israel reviewed surveillance video. “He never went in,” Sheriff Israel said in a news conference. He said the video showed Deputy Peterson doing “nothing.”  “There are no words,” said Sheriff Israel, who described himself as “devastated, sick to my stomach.”  Two other deputies were placed on restricted duty on Thursday because they may have mishandled tips called in to the sheriff’s office over the past two years warning that the suspect, Nikolas Cruz, appeared intent on becoming a school shooter, Sheriff Israel said. The sheriff’s office said in a statement on Saturday that it was investigating whether other deputies had failed to enter the high school to engage the suspect after he opened fire. Officers from the Coral Springs Police Department, who also responded to the shooting, told CNN that at least a few Broward County deputies had hung back during the law enforcement response. Police protocol requires officers to try to confront active shooters as quickly as possible, without waiting for backup. The revelations added to a growing list of failures and missed signs by the authorities that might have helped prevent one of the deadliest school shootings in American history.

The F.B.I. received a tip last month from someone close to Mr. Cruz that he owned a gun and had talked of committing a school shooting, the bureau revealed last week, acknowledging that it had failed to investigate. The tip about Mr. Cruz appeared to be the second in four months, after another person told the bureau about an online comment apparently posted by Mr. Cruz that he wanted to become “a professional school shooter.” The Florida Department of Children and Families, the state social services agency, looked into Mr. Cruz’s well-being in 2016 after he posted on social media that he was cutting himself, but investigators determined he was not at risk of harming himself or others. The Broward County Public Schools had disciplinary complaints on Mr. Cruz dating back to when he was in middle school, including a long history of fighting. Sheriff Israel said he informed Deputy Peterson on Thursday that he was being suspended without pay and placed under internal investigation. At 12:37 p.m. on Thursday, sheriff’s office records show, Deputy Peterson, signed his retirement papers, which amounted to a resignation. He had been with the office for more than 32 years. “The investigation will continue,” Sheriff Israel said. The surveillance video, which was not released, showed Deputy Peterson remained outside the west side of the building for at least four minutes while the gunman was inside, according to Sheriff Israel. The shooting rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School lasted less than six minutes. The video was corroborated by witness statements, Sheriff Israel said. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     The New York Times reported on Wednesday that an officer from the Coral Springs Police Department who responded to the shooting had seen Deputy Peterson in a Stoneman Douglas High parking lot. The deputy “was seeking cover behind a concrete column leading to a stairwell,” Officer Tim Burton said.  In the chaos immediately after the shooting, there were other missteps. A 20-minute delay in school surveillance video confused Coral Springs police officers trying to find the gunman, said Chief Tony Pustizzi. By then, the suspect had already left the building. Chief Pustizzi called it a communications failure. The video system allows for real-time playback. “At first the guys are hearing, ‘Oh, he’s on the second floor.’ Well, it’s not true, ’cause we have people on the second floor and the people are saying, ‘Well, he’s not on the second floor,’ ” Chief Pustizzi said, adding that, if anything, the officers were “more expeditious” as they moved through the school under the belief the gunman was still there. Coral Springs police have said they were the first to respond to the shooting. Sheriff Israel, who defended his office’s response on Wednesday and said his own deputies had not hung back outside the building, said on Thursday that the Coral Springs officers acted “heroically.” Samantha Fuentes, an 18-year-old senior at Stoneman Douglas High who was shot in both legs, said she never saw Deputy Peterson during the “30 minutes” that passed before SWAT officers arrived at the first-floor classroom in which she and other students had been taking a class. “He is not someone who has much of a presence” in the school, she said. Sheriff Israel, flanked by two of his top aides, appeared emotional Thursday during the news conference in which he described Deputy Peterson’s conduct. His eyes appeared to glisten, and his speech was sometimes halting. The two other deputies placed on restricted duty pending an internal investigation were identified by the sheriff’s office as Edward Eason and Guntis Treijs. In November 2017, a caller told the authorities that Mr. Cruz had been stockpiling guns and knives. In a summary of the call, the sheriff’s office said the caller, located in Massachusetts, worried that Mr. Cruz “will kill himself one day and believes he could be a school shooter in the making.” A deputy contacted the person who called, but no report was filed. The caller was referred to the sheriff’s office in Palm Beach County, where the caller said Mr. Cruz lived.  In February 2016, the sheriff’s office received what it described as “thirdhand information” that Mr. Cruz “planned to shoot up the school” and had posted a picture on Instagram of a “juvenile with guns.” A deputy determined that Mr. Cruz had knives and a BB gun and forwarded the information to the school resource officer at Stoneman Douglas High. That was Deputy Peterson. Some of the other calls reveal further details about Mr. Cruz’s troubled childhood. In November 2014, someone reported that a person fitting Mr. Cruz’s description shot a chicken with a possible BB gun. Mr. Cruz was found to own an airsoft rifle, which he admitted to using, but denied he shot chickens. And in September 2016, a peer counselor at Stoneman Douglas High alerted the school resource officer — likely Deputy Peterson — that Mr. Cruz “possibly ingested gasoline” the week prior “in an attempt to commit suicide and is cutting himself.” “Mental health counselor advised Cruz did not meet criteria for Baker Act,” the summary said, referring to the Florida law that allows the police to commit the mentally ill against their will. Stoneman Douglas High initiated a “threat assessment” on Mr. Cruz after the counselor’s report. The Florida Department of Children of Families looked into whether Mr. Cruz was at risk of harming himself or others and concluded he was not because he was living with his mother, attending school and seeing a counselor.

National,78," By STEPHANIE SAUL, TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and ANEMONA HARTOCOLLISMARCH 4, 2018 Maple syrup gumming up the gun belt isn’t normally a hazard of police work. But it is a common problem for Cpl. Pamela Revels when students have been eating pancakes at the school breakfast. “Kids like to come up and give you a little bit of a hug,” Corporal Revels said. “They don’t wipe their hands that well.” Ms. Revels freely dispenses hugs and smiles at the schools where she works around Auburn, Ala. But she is also a sheriff’s deputy who wears a sidearm and a bulletproof vest, drives an official S.U.V. and has an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle stored nearby. On Thursday afternoon, when a report came in about a man in camouflage carrying a gun near school, she sprang into action. As worried students and teachers locked themselves in classrooms and closets, she bolted outdoors, hurriedly walked around the sprawling campus and scanned the nearby woods until she was satisfied that it was safe for everyone to emerge.  “I can turn into a mama bear really quick,” she said. “And I’ve made that decision that nobody is going to hurt my babies if I can help it.” For millions of students, the first adult they see every day at school is not a teacher, or principal. It is a “school resource officer” like Corporal Revels, an often-overlooked role in law enforcement that is under the national glare like never before.  Their duties range from perking up sullen students to directing bus traffic to settling disputes to keeping an eye out for threats. It is that responsibility as the first line of defense that is getting the most attention, as questions swirl over whether the school resource officer at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., failed to do his job when he remained outside the school on Feb. 14 while a former student, Nikolas Cruz, shot 17 people to death inside. The position, with its genial-sounding name, is an unusual hybrid of counselor, educator and cop, and perhaps no other job better personifies America’s shifting ideas about schools, policing and safety. Their numbers exploded during the community-oriented policing wave of the 1990s and even more after the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. As the memory of that shooting faded and local budgets tightened, their ranks thinned in many places. Now there are calls for installing more of them in schools across the country, with new positions announced in a number of districts just this past week, even as the president wants to arm more teachers. Scot Peterson, the Broward County deputy stationed at Stoneman Douglas High, has been called a “coward” by President Trump and assailed by his own boss, Sheriff Scott Israel. But there also has been criticism over the years, including in Broward County, that school officers have been too aggressive, arresting students too quickly for infractions that traditionally warranted a mere trip to the principal’s office or perhaps a suspension. In interviews, school officers around the country spoke of performing multiple adult roles, having to alternate between nurturing and authoritative, with a guiding philosophy known in the field as “the triad” — counselor, teacher, law enforcement officer.  “They have to be a mentor — a kind, caring, trusting adult, the nice police officer who will give you a high-five and ask you how your day is going,” said John McDonald, the security chief for the Jefferson County, Colo., school district, which includes Columbine High. “And very quickly they have to become a tactical cop. That switch is not for everybody. The ability to do that is very difficult.” Officers were reluctant to judge Deputy Peterson’s actions before investigations were completed. But Amy Kingzett, one of seven school resource officers in Fargo, N.D. — one for every public middle and high school — said she expected some fine-tuning of tactics after the Parkland shooting. “We want to make sure we do everything we can to continue those preparations and maybe learn from unfortunate situations of the past,” she said. Mostly, though, their job is to keep order on campus and among adolescents whose fuses are not yet fully grown. Officer Kingzett, 38, was in the cafeteria of a Fargo middle school last week when a fight broke out between a girl and a boy. It started with name-calling, but Officer Kingzett could sense it escalating. As the bell rang and students streamed to their classes, she pulled aside the antagonists and just let them vent, using the listening skills she had learned as a negotiator on the police department’s SWAT team. Crisis over. “It was one of those small victories you could tuck into your back pocket,” she said. Nationally, there are no specific training requirements for the job, although the National Association of School Resource Officers recommends that officers complete a 40-hour course that includes emergency plans for schools, de-escalation techniques and academic work, including studying the adolescent brain. Since most officers are members of their local forces, they also receive the same shooting training their colleagues do. Every school in New York City has at least one school safety officer, who are employed by the New York Police Department and can make arrests, but are unarmed. The department also assigns armed officers to certain schools. The most recent calculations of the number of school resource officers, from 2013, showed that about 30 percent of schools had one, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. In 1975, just 1 percent had.  In some cases, it is not an easy job to fill, according to Mr. McDonald of Jefferson County. “Most cops don’t get into law enforcement to be in school,” he said. “They want to be on the street catching bad guys.”      That problem has helped feed a stereotype that school officers are not the cream of their departments. Mac Hardy, director of operations for the national organization, said bad school resource officers fall into three categories — “hostages,” those who are ordered to work in schools; “retirees,” older officers who are nursing their pensions; and “vacationers” who like having school holidays off, though many work as regular patrol officers during the summer. “You’ve been on the job 20 years and we’ve got to park you someplace. We’re going to put you in a school,” Mr. McDonald said, describing the attitude he said some departments have. “That’s much less of an effective model. We want go-getters.” As the first line of defense, school resource officers are often hailed as heroes when school incidents are defused, or, as in the case of Deputy Peterson, criticized for failing to avert disaster. Mr. Peterson, who resigned from the department, has disputed accusations that he did not fulfill his job, saying through his lawyer that he believed the shots were coming from outdoors and so he waited for the gunman there. One of the heroes was Deputy Carolyn Gudger, who faced off an armed school intruder in 2010, becoming the toast of her eastern Tennessee community, which named her grand marshal of the Food City 250 Nascar race at Bristol Motor Speedway. The man had arrived at the school and asked to meet with the principal, then drew a semiautomatic handgun. Deputy Gudger pushed the principal out of harm’s way, drew her gun and held the intruder at bay, negotiating with him for 10 minutes even as he still had his gun drawn. Other officers arrived and killed him when he refused to drop the weapon. Officer Gudger said she heard criticism that she should have shot the man right away. “I can’t give you a concrete answer on that,” she said last week. “It just wasn’t the time to do it.” Some researchers have attempted to gauge whether school resource officers actually make schools safer. A Congressional Research Service report released after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 said that some studies suggested that the officers’ presence deterred assaults and discouraged students from bringing weapons to campus. The report also noted that students in officer-staffed schools might be more likely to be arrested for low-level offenses.  In 2016, the Obama administration expressed concern about unnecessary arrests after police and sheriff’s departments in several areas, including East Hartford, Conn., and Washington State, were criticized for handcuffing students too readily. Several years earlier, following similar criticism there, Broward County officers and schools created a program to avoid arrests for nonviolent misdemeanors such as disorderly conduct and alcohol and marijuana use. Jeff Bell, president of the Broward Sheriff’s Office Deputies Association, a labor union, said that while the union did not want to “fill jails with juveniles,” it felt the policy may have prevented Mr. Cruz from getting appropriate social services. Had Mr. Cruz been arrested for past misbehavior at school, which reportedly included episodes of assault, “we could have gotten court-ordered mental health care and family services that he so desperately needed,” Mr. Bell said. “We could have taken the guns away.” But Robert W. Runcie, the Broward schools superintendent, said the program had been a success. Some 2,000 students have gone through it, and 90 percent have never had a repeat offense, according to Mr. Runcie. Mr. Runcie said it was inaccurate to suggest Mr. Cruz avoided arrest because of the new program. Mr. Cruz had “serious behavior disorders” that fell under the district’s special education program, the superintendent said. And records show he did receive counseling over the years. Asked whether she had ever averted an attack, Corporal Revels, the Alabama officer, said that several years ago, she began monitoring a student who had a habit of pushing, kicking and bullying other students. “I went deeper and found writings and drawings that were concerning,” she said, and saw to it that the student began mental health treatment. On the day of the lockdown — it was unclear if the gun-toting man was real, or perhaps a wandering hunter — Corporal Revels also helped a kindergartner who had dropped his breakfast get new helpings of sausage and apple juice; saw a teenager storm out of Spanish class, talked with him briefly, and had him back in class in five minutes; complimented students on their choice of pajamas for the school’s Pajama Day; and then drove home to her farm an hour away, where she would respond to three phone calls regarding bullying or other misbehavior at school. Takaya Dupree, a 12th-grader, said Corporal Revels knew almost every student well, since she had been around the school for years. “So I feel like she’ll protect us,” Takaya said. Even if a gunman burst into the school? “It wouldn’t get to that point,” she said. “She’ll probably talk him out of it, before he came to the school.” Adriane Quinlan, Patricia Mazzei and Kate Taylor contributed reporting.

National,79," Supported by By Dan Barry For the latest on the Florida school shooting, read Friday’s live updates. Once again a nation sends thoughts and prayers, because it has happened once again. The flak-jacketed police storming an American school in lockdown. The anguished parents pressing against the police cordon, the morning’s hurried goodbyes suddenly precious. The assembled media unfolding camera tripods and chasing the same story angles as if for the first time. Aerial footage of children filing out of the school, hands above heads in surrender to the tense moment. Then their frantic dash to safety, their young minds yet to process what they have just witnessed. Then that moment when the local law enforcement official, face blanched by the sorrow of what must be imparted, appears before cameras. On Wednesday, it was Scott Israel, the sheriff of Florida’s Broward County, who stepped forward to announce the toll of a massacre inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School: 17 children and adults dead, another 16 wounded. The suspect in custody: Nikolas Cruz, 19, a former student who was expelled from the school and who unnerved acquaintances with his obsession with violence and guns. After the slaughter, the police said, he dropped his legally purchased rifle — an AR-15 — ran out of the school, and bought a drink at a Subway. “There are no words,” Sheriff Israel said. Other than offers of thoughts and prayers. Or “prayers and condolences,” as President Trump wrote on Twitter Wednesday afternoon. Deadly shootings in schools — that is, the killing of children in sanctuaries of learning — have become a distinctly American ritual, the rote responses as familiar as a kindergarten recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. Part of the accepted script is the repeated invocation of the place names of Columbine and Sandy Hook. But these massacres deserve to be more than mere reference points, if only to underscore the protracted inaction of Congress to respond — an inaction that, judging by the Capitol Hill partisanship on display Thursday, seems concretized. For the record: In 1999, two seniors at Columbine High School in Colorado killed 12 students and one teacher in a carefully orchestrated attack. And in 2012, a gunman walked into the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and killed 20 children, none older than 7, and six adults. The nation was shocked, then doubly shocked. But the emerging American tradition of school shootings has continued. Even the dark humor in the headline of a satirical story in The Onion, first published in 2014, has since been stripped of any mirth, leaving only a dark, accepted truth: “‘No Way to Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens.” Jason Roeder, the author of that often-recycled headline, underscored the national sameness of these school shootings on Twitter on Wednesday, saying: “When I wrote this headline, I had no idea it would be applied to the high school a mile from my house.” Last month, in the wake of another school shooting that you may have already forgotten — a 15-year-old boy killing two classmates and wounding 18 other people in Kentucky — a former F.B.I. agent reflected on the lack of shock that she and her colleagues felt over the repetition of these incidents. “I spent four years dealing with these kinds of events after Sandy Hook,” said the former agent, Katherine W. Schweit, a co-author of a study of 160 active shooting incidents in the United States. “We are not going to be out of business very soon. When I retired in July, I left a whole team still doing this. It’s not shock — it’s sadness.” This American ritual does not end with a sheriff’s announcement of the number of dead and wounded. Other parts are acted out in an ever-running play whose plot turns on the national paralysis over the Second Amendment. An organization called Gun Owners of America complains that “another gunman was able to roam freely without any armed teacher or principal opposing him.” Gun control advocates and opponents criticize each other for not allowing the families of victims even one day to grieve. Pundits solemnly pontificate. Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat whose state experienced the Sandy Hook massacre, once again denounced the inaction by Congress to properly address the “epidemic” of school shootings. “We are responsible for a level of mass atrocity that happens in this country with zero parallel anywhere else,” he said. The National Rifle Association, the muscular gun rights organization, remains quiet — for a while. But politicians who have accepted its donations emerge, in implicit or explicit support of everyday access to weapons intended for combat. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who has benefited from N.R.A. largess over the years, expressed his sadness about another mass shooting in his state — remember the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016 that left 49 dead and dozens wounded? — but warned against assuming that gun restrictions would have prevented the tragedy. And Mr. Trump, whose 2016 campaign enjoyed considerable N.R.A. support, did not appear on camera on Wednesday, choosing to send his condolences to the families of victims via Twitter. Then, on Thursday, the president managed to address the shooting without any reference to guns; instead, he promised to work with others “to help secure our schools, and tackle the difficult issue of mental health” — a now-familiar promise, uttered by many. In this case, it is left to the young to cut through the deadening sameness. On Wednesday night, a 17-year-old boy in a dark T-shirt named David Hogg — fresh from escaping the massacre at his high school — looked into a CNN camera to address this country’s political leaders. “We are children,” he said. “You guys are the adults. Work together, come over your politics, and get something done.” As moving as the young man’s words are, there have been other moving words over the years — other moving moments that seemed destined to break the paralysis somehow, and save lives. The first child’s funeral after Sandy Hook, for example. But nothing. Instead, there is Lulu Ramadan, a reporter for The Palm Beach Post who, in her short journalism career, has covered three mass shootings that have left a total of 71 people dead. This sobering thought struck her Wednesday night, as she was waiting outside a Marriott hotel where parents of students at Stoneman Douglas High were being reunited with their children. “By now, unfortunately, I think I’m used to it,” Ms. Ramadan said. “It’s more like a routine, and I kind of know what to expect.” And there is the Rev. Sharon Risher, who was resting on her couch in Charlotte, N.C., when reports about the Florida shooting came across her television. Her heart leapt at the sight of children fleeing a school, and she switched the channel. Her mother, Ethel Lance, was one of the nine black churchgoers shot dead by a white supremacist during a Bible class in Charleston, S.C., in 2015. Ms. Risher said she already knows what will follow. “People will rally, and they will voice their opinions on social media about how sad it is, and how they’re praying,” she said. “But in the next month or so, it will be gone. And those families, like me, will have to deal with the devastation of our lives while everyone else moves on.” Governors order flags to fly at half-staff. Funeral services for children are staggered, so as to accommodate a broken community. Schools everywhere announce that counselors stand at the ready. And a nation sends thoughts and prayers.

Opinion,80," Supported by By Ross Douthat Since the Parkland shootings in Florida, Senator Marco Rubio has done many of the things liberals say they are desperate, desperate for decent Republicans to do. He has changed his position on gun control, expressing support for new restrictions: age limits on gun purchases, new background check rules, possibly magazine restrictions. He has co-sponsored legislation encouraging states to issue restraining orders that temporarily would strip people deemed dangerous of their guns. Some of these measures have conservative support, but in other cases the Florida Republican has effectively bucked the N.R.A. But over the same period Rubio, more than any other prominent Republican, has been vigorously and sometimes virulently attacked by the student-led movement that filled D.C. with protesters last weekend. When he showed up for the CNN town hall he met boos and heckles; one of the shooting survivors told him that just looking at him was like staring down the barrel of an assault rifle. Notwithstanding his subsequent policy concessions, at the March for Our Lives the students wore price tags around their neck, $1.05 each — the amount of money Rubio’s campaigns have received from the N.R.A. divided by the number of students in Florida schools. David Hogg, one of their leaders, began his speech with the price tag line, and told a CNN interviewer that if anything he feels that their attacks on the Florida senator haven’t been provocative enough. There was a time, not so many years ago, when Rubio was attacked and his efforts at bipartisanship regarded skeptically because liberals perceived him as a threat — a plausible and eloquent leader for a less bunkered G.O.P., a bridge between the party’s old white base and a more multicultural America. That time has passed, at least for now: After Rubio was defeated and partially undone by Donald Trump, and especially after he turned in his #NeverTrump card and filmed a hostage-video endorsement, the official media consensus on the Florida senator flipped from “Great Republican Hope” to “Liddle Marco,” and anti-Rubio sentiment became dominated less by anxiety than by contempt. That contempt seems to inform some of the reaction to his every public utterance since Parkland. But I think that in their anti-Rubio zeal the student activists are also picking up on a general approach to politics that the Trump era has encouraged among liberals — a view that since the current Republican majorities were forged by anger and a kind of smash-mouth politics, it’s incumbent upon liberals to give no quarter in return, and to treat any sudden conciliation from a prominent figure like the Florida senator not as an opportunity for deal making but as a welcome sign of weakness that should inspire further fierce attack. This theory has a certain logic to it. Yes, if anti-gun activists spent less time screaming at him, Rubio’s efforts might open up a little more common ground on gun policy. But Rubio is only one senator, previous pushes for gun regulation have had Republican senatorial sponsors before dying by filibuster, and in 2013, when liberals were broadly favorable to his efforts, Rubio couldn’t deliver immigration reform because the Republican House wasn’t having it. The problem, then, is relying on the bipartisan impulses of few Republican politicians when what you need is a broader climate change. The path to that change requires first putting the fear of God (or, if you prefer, the fear of the Arc of History) into vulnerable Republican lawmakers, and then making them unpopular enough that you can simply beat them. And the rage against Rubio, it could be argued, is a good example of how the two approaches reinforce each other. So far the experience of being screamed at hasn’t made him repudiate his support for new gun measures; perhaps, indeed, it has helped concentrate his mind on the political reasons that he should support them, while providing an example for activists in other states to use to shame their own Republican representatives for their ties to the N.R.A. Meanwhile Rubio’s approval rating in Florida is not exactly great, and while his next election is a long way off, he’s precisely the kind of Republican who needs to be defeated to build a Democratic supermajority. So the chance to make him the face of G.O.P. intransigence on gun control, even when he isn’t actually the face of intransigence at the moment, is an opportunity too important to be missed. The deeper logic here is that the only plausible mission for Democrats after the Trumpian takeover of the G.O.P. is a kind of Carthaginian peace: Delenda est the Grand Old Party. In a different world maybe you could make deals with a Republican like Rubio; in this world with this G.O.P., you can work with him only if you’re clearly the one forcing him to the table, and ultimately that’s just a means to the real goal of his eventual defeat. I don’t want to wring my hands about this attitude’s corrosive effect on our politics, because it seems to me that once conservatism surrendered to Donald Trump, arguments about corrosion became a bit irrelevant. Rubio shouldn’t be in politics if he can’t handle vehement attacks, and the president that the Florida senator endorsed is as consistently ad hominem as the young school shooting survivors with rather less excuse. But there are things that you can risk or lose when you fight the way Rubio’s critics seem to want to fight. For instance, one reason that the Dreamer amnesty was an executive decision that Donald Trump could simply reverse, landing us in our current immigration stalemate, was that the Obama White House deliberately chose to make it one, pre-empting an effort by, yes, Marco Rubio to craft bipartisan legislation. That was a good example of smash-mouth liberalism, albeit substantive in that case rather than just rhetorical and driven by fear of Rubio rather than the current spirit of contempt: Don’t let a Republican politician make nice with Latino voters, don’t let Republicans disguise their anti-immigrant views with modest bipartisan maneuvers, create a clear contrast so that voters will reward you even if doing so requires pushing certain constitutional limits on your power. And it didn’t work out particularly well. Indeed if anything Obama’s executive action contributed to Trump’s victory by helping to radicalize conservative voters, and now several years later the Dreamer cohort is back in limbo because the executive move lacked bipartisan support and legislative form. Maybe in the longer run the whole debate will help smash the G.O.P. as liberals believe it deserves to be smashed — but not just yet. Or another example, this one in the Trump era itself: During the debate over the Republican tax bill it was, again, Marco Rubio who made an extended effort to move the bill in a more middle-class-friendly direction by adding and then enlarging a child tax credit. The push was opposed by many of his Republican colleagues, but for a time Rubio thought that he could get an amendment in with Senate Democrat support. But in the end, presumably on the grounds that modestly improving a Republican bill makes it harder to attack it later, only nine Senate Democrats voted for the Rubio proposal, and it went down to an easy defeat. Again, maybe this was an example of tough liberals brilliantly playing hardball: Don’t let Rubio have any kind of victory for his slightly more popular flavor of Republicanism, so that he and his party will be easier to crush in 2018 and beyond. But in the interim it meant that Senate Democrats gave up a chance to move real world public policy in a direction many of them support, in order to pursue an as-yet-hypothetical larger victory that may not, like the Hillary Clinton presidency before it, actually materialize. It’s too soon to say whether this dynamic will repeat itself with the post-Parkland gun control debate. Again, the activists’ anti-Rubio zeal might actually help the progress of legislation, by holding him to his newfound promises. Or there might be no point in making a deal unless he’s willing to accept something closer to the full list of activist demands. Or no bargain of any sort might be possible so long as Republicans hold the Senate, or even so long as they hold seats in states like Florida — in which case the hate for the senator is just a necessary path to his eventual retirement. I am personally agnostic on all of these points. For all his various bipartisan efforts, it’s true that Rubio has not proven that he can actually deliver the votes for major compromises. And having watched the Trump G.O.P. hold power with a largely negative agenda and an ugly rhetorical style, I can certainly believe that a no-quarter liberalism will gain power eventually in its turn. But I can also believe that the obvious pleasure to be found in demonizing the Republican most likely to do outreach could deliver liberalism more of what it has already been earning for itself these last few years: the satisfaction of self-righteousness as a compensation for the absence of political or policy success.

National,81," By NEIL REISNER and DAVE PHILIPPSFEB. 20, 2018 CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. — Cadet Peter Wang dreamed of attending the United States Military Academy at West Point one day, but he never got the chance. The 15-year-old was shot down last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as he held open a door so others could escape. As he was laid to rest on Tuesday, West Point issued his family a ceremonial letter of acceptance. “One of U.S.M.A.’s priorities is to develop leaders of character who are committed to the values of duty, honor and country,” the academy wrote on Twitter. “Peter Wang’s actions on February 14 are an example of those principles, and the academy honors his dream of being a West Point cadet.” The 17 people killed in the shooting rampage included three members of the school’s popular Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps: Mr. Wang, Martin Duque and Alaina Petty. Fellow students say the cadets acted valiantly, helping to usher others to safety. All three have been posthumously awarded the Medal of Heroism by the Army. The accused gunman, Nikolas Cruz, 19, had also been a Junior R.O.T.C. cadet. The corps is one of the high school’s largest clubs, with nearly 300 students who take courses in subjects like military drill, leadership and shooting. Their maroon polo shirts were a familiar sight around the school campus. Mr. Cruz may have counted on that. The police say he was wearing his maroon polo shirt when he was arrested, after having slipped away unnoticed after the rampage.  “We all have those shirts,” Angelyse Perez, an 18-year-old senior in the corps, told The Washington Post. “We’re never wearing them again. We’re going to destroy them all.”  Other cadets credited their corps training with helping to minimize the carnage at the school. But Mr. Cruz’s ties to the corps — The Associated Press reported that he had honed his shooting skills on its marksmanship team — raised troubling questions. The Pentagon spends $370 million a year on Junior R.O.T.C. programs at about 3,400 high schools across the country, hoping to foster the next generation of military leaders. Some communities welcome Junior R.O.T.C., but in others, it meets resistance from parents and advocacy groups who say it promotes militarism among impressionable youths. Junior R.O.T.C. has been criticized for focusing on poorer schools with larger minority populations, and for using scarce resources to steer students toward the military, rather than giving them skills for other careers. The program does not require students to commit to enlisting in the military, and its leaders say it instills discipline and integrity that can help students in any career. Mr. Wang’s funeral on Tuesday was attended by hundreds of people. He lay in an open coffin in the small chapel at Kraeer Funeral Home, dressed in a Junior R.O.T.C. uniform like the one he wore the day he was killed, with the Medal for Heroism pinned to the chest. A line of mourners, many of them in uniform, stretched out of the chapel. Gov. Rick Scott ordered the Florida National Guard to honor the three cadets. Veterans from all over the country began a campaign to mail military patches to Mr. Wang’s family. And those who knew him spoke in tribute.      “He was always looking to do things for others before himself,” said a classmate, Logan De Lima, 13. Ms. Petty, 14, whose funeral was Monday, saw the Junior R.O.T.C. program as a way to give back to the community, according to a statement from her family, who carried in her coffin covered by an American flag. “She loved to serve,” the statement said. Cadets were also among the wounded in the attack at the school. Samantha Fuentes, an 18-year-old senior, was shot in both legs and was left with a piece of shrapnel lodged behind her right eye. Ms. Fuentes said in an interview that she had known Mr. Cruz from the corps. She and other students were sheltering in a classroom, she said, when gunfire burst through the narrow pane of glass next to the room’s locked door. Two in the classroom were killed. Mr. Cruz then looked in to see what he had wrought, she said, and she saw his face.  When the attack began, she said, the class had been discussing hate groups and the history of the Holocaust. Neil Reisner reported from Coral Springs, Fla., and David Philipps from Denver. Nick Madigan contributed reporting from Miami.

National,82," By SHERI FINKFEB. 20, 2018 In the intense aftermath of the school shooting last week, Dr. Igor Nichiporenko pronounced a wounded teacher dead on arrival and massaged the bullet-shredded heart of a student, trying in vain to restart it. He and his colleagues also treated six other teenagers, some of whom were in the emergency room and others who were rolled off to operating theaters. Then, about an hour after the victims began pouring into Broward Health North hospital, word came that another patient was about to arrive. With distraught relatives and journalists converging on the hospital in Deerfield Beach, Fla., the medical staff now faced the challenge of treating the man accused of causing all the carnage. “Dealing with trauma patients, you’re always going to have to deal with the bad guys, too,” Dr. Nichiporenko said, recalling the myriad times when crime suspects and victims were in rooms next to one another. “You have to be professional and do your job.” This was a tragedy of rare magnitude: 17 killed at a high school just miles down the road. When President Trump visited wounded victims of the shooting at the hospital on Friday, he was not far from the room where the suspect in the attack, Nikolas Cruz, was treated two days earlier. As the frequency of mass shootings rises, the arrival of a captured gunman in a hospital remains unusual — studies show the majority die at the time of the crime. Many commit suicide, as did the Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock. Some are killed by those trying to stop them: A police shootout ended the slaughter by Omar Mateen at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., in 2016. Occasionally, however, the very medical staff tending to victims of a mass shooting are called on to treat the suspect. That happened in November 2009 in Fort Hood, Tex., after Maj. Nidal Hasan opened fire. He took aim at a 23-year-old Army medic, Specialist Francisco De la Serna, and missed. Specialist De la Serna, who stanched the bleeding of many of Major Hasan’s victims, also applied a dressing to the gunman’s chest wound after he exchanged fire with the police. Major Hasan, himself a doctor, was then transported to a hospital where his victims were being treated. “It was the right thing to do,” said Mr. De la Serna, who was later honored for his bravery and is now a medical student at the University of Kansas. “It was the opposite,” he added, “of what somebody of that mind-set would have done.” As of Monday, two survivors of the shooting last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High remained hospitalized in fair condition at Broward Health North, and two others remained in fair condition at Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, according to Jennifer Smith, a spokeswoman for the health system. In all, 17 patients from the attack were treated at three of the system’s hospitals. The teacher and student pronounced dead after reaching Broward Health North were the only shooting victims who died in those hospitals. Others were pronounced dead at the scene. The patients who arrived at Broward Health North had gunshot wounds mainly in their chests and abdomens, Dr. Nichiporenko said. They seemed pale and quiet as they were carried in, which can be an ominous sign of major bleeding. “I think they were all in stress and emotionally shocked,” Dr. Nichiporenko said. “Nobody was screaming.” They were “14-, 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds,” Dr. Nichiporenko said, though the level-two trauma center is not specifically designated for children under 16. “We’re all trained to take care of pediatric patients if we need to treat them and stabilize them,” he said. When the call came about the suspect’s arrival, the hospital staff made arrangements to treat him. “They called in with a gunshot wound,” Dr. Nichiporenko said. “He stated that he was shot, so everybody thought he was injured.” A team of four was assigned to treat Mr. Cruz in the emergency room — two nurses and two doctors, including Dr. Nichiporenko, the hospital’s trauma director, who trained as a trauma surgeon at St. Vincent’s Hospital and Medical Center in New York and hails from Moscow. “We just picked people we know can stay cool,” Dr. Nichiporenko said. “We chose the ones who wouldn’t get emotional about it.” The hospital had already been locked down — its entrances, exits and trauma rooms were guarded by security staff. Mr. Cruz was brought in a back entrance and treated in an isolated part of the emergency room, “where no families or relatives of the victims could have any access whatsoever,” Dr. Nichiporenko said. “We did it in a way that they wouldn’t even know the shooter was in the hospital.” The hospital system had participated in the county’s first full activation drill for a mass shooting, complete with SWAT team response, five years ago, said Kelly Keys, the system’s manager of emergency preparedness. Last year, Broward Health North ran an active shooting simulation. And Broward Health Medical Center received victims of a mass shooting at Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in January 2017. Mr. Cruz was brought into a critical care room, lying on a stretcher in his street clothes. “Is anything hurting you?” Dr. Nichiporenko said he asked. Mr. Cruz did not answer. He appeared “really flat, no expression,” the doctor said of Mr. Cruz, noting that he looked the same in a court appearance the next day, wearing a jail jumpsuit.      In keeping with hospital protocol, the maroon Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps polo shirt and pants Mr. Cruz was wearing were cut off so that any injuries could be located. Dr. Nichiporenko examined him from head to toe but found no gunshot wounds. His vital signs were stable. He stayed silent, not uttering a word when the doctor was with him and not answering any questions, the doctor said. “I went back to treat the trauma patients,” Dr. Nichiporenko said, adding that he had turned over Mr. Cruz’s care to an emergency physician, who cleared him for release. According to the ethics of their professions, doctors and nurses must treat patients according to need in emergencies, without regard to other factors. By law, hospitals in the United States must also stabilize and treat anyone arriving in an emergency department. Dr. Nichiporenko said that staff members were upset, but he did not hear anyone express the opinion, inside or outside the hospital, that Mr. Cruz should not have been treated. “He got good care,” he said. Mr. Cruz was discharged within about 40 minutes, the doctor estimated. Still wearing a hospital gown, he was rolled in a wheelchair to a police car. By then, word had spread in the hospital that the gunman was there, but Dr. Nichiporenko said staff members remained focused on treating the wounded teenagers. “We still had a lot of work to do,” he said. Two days later, the doctor escorted the president and Melania Trump, the first lady, through the hospital for private meetings with two remaining patients and their families. The president emerged to speak briefly with the news media, flanked by the doctor and Mrs. Trump. “Fantastic hospital, and they have done an incredible job,” Mr. Trump said, turning to Dr. Nichiporenko and shaking his hand. “I want to congratulate you.” Dr. Nichiporenko said he observed only one person — a parent of one of the wounded teenagers — pressing Mr. Trump to make sure this kind of tragedy never happened again. “We’re going to work on it,” Dr. Nichiporenko recalled Mr. Trump as saying. He did not elaborate, the doctor said.

                APRIL 5, 2018 BlackRock may have found a simple solution to its gun dilemma. The fund manager, led by Laurence D. Fink, will offer new products allowing individuals and institutions to invest in market indexes without putting money into manufacturers and retailers of firearms. Coupled with a plan to engage public gunmakers and sellers directly, the decision moves Mr. Fink closer to fulfilling a promise that BlackRock’s business benefit society alongside the bottom line. Because it has over $6 trillion of client money to invest, much of it in products that follow stock and bond market indexes, BlackRock is among the top owners of nearly every public company. That includes American Outdoor Brands, maker of the AR-15-style rifle used to murder 17 high school students and their teachers in Parkland, Fla., in February. And that put Mr. Fink, who has urged companies to serve a social purpose, in an uncomfortable position at a time of mass demonstrations and consumer boycotts over gun violence. On Thursday, his firm unveiled a range of index products that will enable investors to withhold their support for gunmakers and sellers. They include an exchange-traded fund that will track the performance of the MSCI USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus Index, composed of small stocks with favorable environmental, social and governance standards, while specifically excluding producers and large retailers of civilian firearms. It will also offer a similar credit-focused E.T.F. that eschews the debt of gunmakers and distributors. Perhaps more significant, BlackRock will offer an option to take the guns out of institutional strategies tracking major market indexes, including the Standard & Poor’s 500, the Russell 2000 and three others. The reason: Amid the debate over gun safety that the Parkland tragedy has unleashed, many pension funds and company 401(k) plans have been looking to disarm, largely in response to the demand of their own members. BlackRock’s moves may spark criticism from gun-rights supporters, who lashed out at companies, like Delta Air Lines, that severed ties with the National Rifle Association. But it’s hard to see how offering customers more choice is ever a bad idea. Moreover, by getting out early, BlackRock makes clear to those young people lobbying for tighter gun laws — who it hopes will be customers for decades to come — that it has something for them. Far from virtue signaling, it’s simply good business. Rob Cox is editor of Reuters Breakingviews. For more independent commentary and analysis, visit breakingviews.com.

Insider,84," By GINA KOLATAMARCH 4, 2018 I’m one of those head-in-the-sand people who would rather not know about guns and violence and how terrible bombings and shootings can be. In 2013, I was at the Boston Marathon when the bombs went off. I grabbed my family, and we rushed out of that city. But I had to return the next day to report on the victims and their injuries. It was unbearably sad and even though I ran the marathon the next year; even though was supposed to be a celebration of resilience, I did not feel that way at all. I remembered too well what had happened to those bombing victims. So, of course, I read the minimum about the Parkland shooting. I knew the basics. A teenager went into a Florida high school on Valentine’s Day, armed with a military style weapon, and began shooting. In six minutes he killed 14 students and three staff members and injured many others. Then my editors asked me to write about assault-style weapons like the AR-15 used in Parkland and what they do to the human body. My big concern was that the story had to be compelling enough that someone like me — who would rather not know — would start it and read it to the end. That meant, as always, writing for an audience of one — me. And I did not want to be polemical. This was not the place to rail about gun laws. It was going to be a story about the destruction assault type weapons can wreak. It began as a solo project. But my editor, Celia Dugger, ultimately suggested bringing in C.J. Chivers. At the start, I knew nothing about guns; C.J., on the other hand, is a Pulitzer-Prize winning reporter who modestly says he has “some seeming fluency here from a lot of years of writing about weapons, and from being in the infantry.” His tweaks to my language describing weapons and bullets made such a difference that it was only right to share the byline with him. As for the reporting, I began by finding trauma surgeons who had been in the military and cared for shooting victims. I knew a few, because I had written about Representative Steve Scalise, who was shot while practicing baseball last summer and spent months recovering from a bullet that cracked his bones and rended his internal organs. One surgeon, who said he cannot speak on the record, connected me with others who could. Still, was I just going to get the same story over and over about trying to repair wounds? Could a surgeon explain more than just how to repair an injury? And was a military assault weapon, the M16, pretty much the same as an AR-15, the gun the shooter used, in terms of the damage they could inflict? The effects of the weapons’ bullets, I soon discovered, were pretty much equivalent. Through the eyes of each surgeon, however, I saw a different picture. One told me about the nature of the wounds. He’d see a little hole where the bullet entered and think it was not so bad. Then he’d turn the patient over, and see an exit wound that could be a foot wide. Another told me what it looks like when a victim arrives at the operating room, bones shattered, organs shredded: “It’s like a bomb went off.” For me, it found that it reading about these horrors was different than reporting on them. It’s hard to explain why; perhaps it’s something like the experience of those who tend to the wounded, that detachment they wear like shields. When I thought I was done with the story, I was put in touch with Dr. Lillian Liao, a surgeon who cared for children shot with an AR-15 in the November Sutherland Springs church shooting. Dr. Liao was professional; she seemed almost dispassionate as she described grievous injuries. But when I asked her if it affected her, she told me two things. Dr. Liao was focused on getting the children stable enough to return home — although they faced many operations and are still being treated at her hospital, University Hospital and UT Health in San Antonio. She knew they would need rehabilitation to help them learn to walk or use their arms again. She knew they were seeing psychiatrists to help with the trauma. Then, about two weeks later, she began to think about what had happened — these children’s lives would never be the same. She went on, putting the horror behind her. Until the Parkland shootings, at which point she could no longer forget.

U.S./Politics,85," By MATT FLEGENHEIMER and JESS BIDGOODAPRIL 1, 2018 BERRYVILLE, Va. — For more than a month now, the questions have ricocheted down this Main Street culled from a Norman Rockwell dreamscape — past the dueling barbershops and the outdoor broom sale and the mural with the horse — quietly at first, when the Florida massacre was still fresh, and then not so quietly. Why would this time be different? Why should it be? “Every time something happens, everybody’s hollering,” Garland Ashby, 77, the owner of an estimated 75 guns, said of the recent protests over gun control, rubbing at his cigarette stub from a park bench in this town of 4,200. “A couple of months it’s in the news, and then it’s gone.” More than a week has passed since some 800 student-led marches pulsed through the country and abroad — more than a week for momentum to build, or stall out, or morph into something beyond anyone’s control. And in this tossup congressional district, a short drive from the demonstration’s nexus in Washington, and in other House battlegrounds nationwide, a consensus has formed on at least this much: Both sides think they are being underestimated. Both insist their adversaries will tire eventually, punching themselves out. “It’ll go away,” Mr. Ashby predicted, grinding the cigarette into the mud. “Like all the other times.”  “They’re looking for us to get bored,” said Rosie Banks, 17, a high school junior about 40 miles east in Sterling, Va., whose bedroom includes the “Am I Next?” sign she hauled across the capital last month and a fish named Malcolm X. “We’re not going to get bored.”  This has certainly not happened yet. Both before and after the march, high school students have shown themselves eager to hatch longer-term plans, with some plotting together last week through their spring breaks. In this stretch of Northern Virginia, students are trying to organize a town hall with Representative Barbara Comstock, one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress, recognizing that her support from the National Rifle Association could be a drag in a district that preferred Hillary Clinton in 2016. New voter registration pushes, steered by teenagers, are well underway. Students are consulting with established (and adult-run) groups like Everytown for Gun Safety, founded and financed by Michael R. Bloomberg, and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence — with plans to discuss how to host their own candidate events before November or start clubs at their schools. Even less politically active students in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District have learned Ms. Comstock’s name. “They know who she is,” said Paige Thimmesch, 16, Ms. Banks’s classmate in Sterling, Va., who is hoping to arrange the forum with the congresswoman. “They don’t know every single policy. They do know that she is pro-gun.” Looking to history, fledgling activists are researching Vietnam-era student protests for context and inspiration. They are using words like “intersectional.” They are quoting favored lyrics from “Hamilton”: “This is not a moment, it’s the movement.” That movement, though, will hinge on reversing years of below-average voter turnout among young Americans — translating sound and fury into the long, slow work of lasting change. In the 2014 midterm elections, less than 20 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 turned out to cast ballots, compared to more than 40 percent of voters between 45 and 59, according to an analysis of survey data by the United States Elections Project, which is run by Michael P. McDonald, an associate professor of political science at the University of Florida. Recent polling suggests the gap could close, at least somewhat, this fall. A Quinnipiac University survey released in late February found that 54 percent of those 18 to 34 said they were more motivated than usual to vote, outpacing every other age group.  While youth-driven movements in recent years, like Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street, have installed themselves as forces in Democratic politics and the national discourse, their effects at the ballot box have been uncertain. Gun owners, mindful that flurries of mass activism have often dissipated on their own after past shootings, are still taking no chances. Some efforts have been unsavory: Survivors of the Parkland, Fla., massacre in February have been the subject of internet conspiracy theories and bizarre fictions. More civic-minded supporters of gun rights are discussing counter-rallies this month to demonstrate their collective might. “All these calls for gun control are only making gun owners snap to attention,” said Philip Van Cleave, the leader of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a gun rights group. “This is not a one-way movement by any means.”      Then there is the N.R.A., whose track record includes few political losses in recent memory — its power derived less from direct donations than a fine-tuned electioneering machine primed to mobilize voters with a letter-grade system for assessing candidates and tens of millions of dollars in campaign ads and voter-guide mailings. Shortly after the Parkland shooting, President Trump expressed support for gun restrictions opposed by the N.R.A., scolding fellow Republicans for kowtowing to the group. It did not take long, after an Oval Office meeting with N.R.A. officials, for the president to reverse himself. Yet even in corners of the country unaccustomed to dissent on gun issues, supporters of restrictions sense an opening. In Maine’s Second Congressional District, a region that includes both small cities and parcels of land so rural they are officially called “unorganized territory,” school walkouts and satellite March for Our Lives protests have specked the map, powered by students and Democratic activists. Though gun owners have betrayed little immediate concern — “If they hang around, we’ll still be here, and if they don’t, we’ll still be here,” said Todd Tolhurst, the president of Gun Owners of Maine — students seem comfortable with their odds in any war of attrition. “We’ll outlive them,” said Sean Monteith, 17, a junior at Lewiston High School, adding that he hoped his peers would be able to outvote them, too. His cellphone includes a list of action items and reminders: “connect with city council,” “draft legislation,” “do not go on assumptions.” Back in Washington, a handful of Republicans seem attuned to at least two of those directives, hedging their positions in recent weeks to accommodate the post-Parkland moment. Several vulnerable members signed on to a Democratic bill authorizing federal research into gun violence. Two of them, Brian Mast and Carlos Curbelo, both Republicans from Florida, have endorsed an assault weapons ban. Activists appear determined to make others pay a professional price for declining to engage. In Colorado’s Sixth District, where Representative Mike Coffman is widely considered one of the most endangered Republican incumbents, organizers with Never Again Colorado, a new group advocating gun control, are planning a forum to discuss guns “with or without” Mr. Coffman. The district includes Aurora, where a gunman killed 12 people in a movie theater in 2012. “We have a lot of momentum right now,” said Ian Gaskins, 17, a high school junior who is helping to plan the event. “I don’t want people to stop caring about this until the next mass shooting.”  For Democrats, the zeal for gun control has at once presented an uncommon opportunity and an occasion to revisit plans for midterm messaging. After Mr. Trump’s election, his opponents did not necessarily expect a gun reckoning to be central to their 2018 strategy. Last summer, as the party strained to communicate its own agenda in the Trumpian haze, Democrats chose Berryville as the backdrop to introduce a broad-strokes platform of economic populism. Their top leaders in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, and progressive stars like Senator Elizabeth Warren schlepped 65 miles outside Washington to deliver their message in the same park where Mr. Ashby, the gun owner, flicked away his cigarette on a recent afternoon. Eight months later, it is gun violence, more than any fiscal issue, that has galvanized a new generation of prospective Democrats, some not yet old enough to vote. In Virginia, the party had already long targeted Ms. Comstock, casting her as a poor fit for a district that includes some rural pockets, like Berryville, but also left-leaning Washington suburbs and vast reserves of more moderate voters repelled by Mr. Trump. “Barbara Bump-Stock,” said Candy Baracat-Donovan, 34, from Leesburg, Va., whose morning routine now includes a round of phone calls to the offices of representatives like Ms. Comstock. A spokesman for Ms. Comstock, Jeff Marschner, said the congresswoman was “committed to a multipronged effort to prevent gun violence,” citing her support for additional mental health funding and narrow, N.R.A.-backed legislation improving reporting to the national background check database, among other measures. It is not clear if she will agree to a town hall with students. They seem to understand the calculation. “High school students are scary,” said Jay Falk, 18, a senior in Virginia who co-founded Students Demand Action DMV, a gun control group with over 100 members. “We are not cynical yet.” Matt Flegenheimer reported from Berryville, Va., and Jess Bidgood from Lewiston, Me.

Washington,86," Supported by On Washington By Carl Hulse WASHINGTON — As the nation faced another crisis, polls clearly reflected what a significant majority of the public thought should be done. A bipartisan move to draft a legislative response finally gained steam after years of stasis. A stunning breakthrough looked to be at hand. The issue was put to the test in a series of votes on the Senate floor. Backers of the bipartisan compromise showed they could get tantalizingly close to the magic threshold of 60 votes, but still came up short at 54 and the entire effort collapsed in failure. That situation aptly describes what occurred last week when the Senate took on immigration. But it also depicts — down to the 54 votes for a leading bipartisan proposal — what happened the last time the Senate voted on major gun control legislation, in 2013, after the  school shooting in Newtown, Conn. It is also a predictable result if significant gun control legislation emerges in Congress in the aftermath of the school massacre in Parkland, Fla. That prospect underscores the parallels between the two politically divisive issues and the difficulties of enacting meaningful legislation even when a majority in Congress and the public agree. The inability to push legislation over the finish line has lawmakers fed up while feeding public discontent with Washington. “I think people in this country today are very frustrated with gridlock on issues that they believe should be resolvable,” said Senator Susan Collins, a leading Republican centrist from Maine. “We are not talking about dealing with North Korea, which is a really tough issue. We are talking about issues that have reasonable, readily available solutions.” So how is it that proposals with such strong support and seeming momentum can be so quickly derailed? “Great question,” said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and one of those deeply involved in the bipartisan immigration talks. “It is one that has been haunting me this week.” No one disputes that the polls show strong public support for protecting hundreds of thousands of Dreamers, the undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children — the goal of last week’s debate — as well as strengthening background checks on prospective gun buyers. The last matter is becoming a central element of possible legislation to be considered when lawmakers return to Washington next week. The problem is that while those views might represent a majority of the nation and even a bipartisan majority of the House and Senate, they seem to be a minority sentiment among the Republicans who control Congress as well as the White House. Given that reality, backers of bipartisan compromise, energized by public support on those issues, can press their case and get to the edge of success but still not prevail. “The views of the Republicans in power are in the minority when it comes to issues like immigration and guns,” said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, an immigrant rights group. “Those of us trying to figure out how to ride the wave of public opinion are up against an intense minority that is the tail wagging the G.O.P. dog.” Top congressional Republicans and President Trump say they are simply representing their constituents who see gun control as a threat to deeply personal Second Amendment rights and unenforced immigration laws as a threat to American jobs and security. And conservative Republican voters, at least in the past, have been more driven on these issues than Democrats or moderate Republicans. But while Republican leaders have been able to successfully thwart the bipartisan push behind both gun safety and immigration legislation, loud public demands for action have meant they could not ignore them altogether. With a special program for young undocumented immigrants at risk of expiring, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, was forced to allow votes on the immigration proposals that went nowhere last week. Backers of a bipartisan plan that would have given the Dreamers — but not their parents — a path to citizenship in exchange for $25 billion for a wall on the Southern border sought by the president believed they had the 60 votes needed to advance any significant legislation in the Senate. But their deal came under scathing attack from the administration, which also wanted new curbs on family-based migration opposed by Democrats and some Republicans. Several anticipated Republican votes for the bipartisan deal melted away, and gridlock resulted once again. “It was all or nothing and they got nothing,” said Mr. Sharry, who noted Mr. Trump sacrificed what had previously been his overriding immigration priority, the wall. As lawmakers start to discuss among themselves about possible approaches to gun safety after the Florida shooting, they are fearful of the same dynamic emerging. They worry that a majority of Republicans will entertain votes on consensus gun safety measures only in exchange for support for measures that other lawmakers and gun safety advocates find unacceptable. Lawmakers and congressional officials say suggestions are already percolating that any legislation tightening background checks would be tied to a House-passed proposal that would require state-issued permits to carry concealed weapons to be transferable across state lines, forcing all states to recognize a permit issued in one jurisdiction. Currently, states have widely varying standards for issuing such permits and the push to grant “reciprocity” would meet stiff Democratic resistance in the Senate, diminishing chances for any bipartisan agreement. Gun control supporters were somewhat heartened by Mr. Trump’s comments on Wednesday at the White House that gun control efforts would this time go beyond simple “talk,” but they are also realistic, particularly with crucial midterm elections looming and both parties grappling for the political upper hand. “I find myself hoping that this time it is real and that it isn’t Lucy and the football,” Mr. Coons said. “I have to keep believing in the possibility of a functional Senate, but on gun violence I am not optimistic. “ In light of the recent shared experience with both gun safety and immigration proposals, he probably shouldn’t be.

Opinion,87," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Aaron K. Chatterji In the wake of the school shootings in Parkland, Fla., companies like Delta, Hertz and Symantec distanced themselves from the National Rifle Association by eliminating benefits to their members. Dick’s Sporting Goods, which owns 35 Field and Stream stores (which feature hunting gear and supplies), took it a step further: The company announced that it had unilaterally raised the age limit for firearms sales and stopped selling the AR-15, the weapon used in Parkland and other recent mass shootings. The chief executive, Edward Stack, said that the company was “going to take a stand and step up and tell people our view and, hopefully, bring people along into the conversation.” Less than 24 hours later, Walmart joined Dick’s in raising the age limit on firearm sales (Walmart stopped selling AR-15s years ago). They exemplify a recent phenomenon, “C.E.O. activism,” in which corporations and their chief executives pick a side in the culture war. Some companies have benefited, through gains in popularity or even sales, by taking such stands. Patagonia reportedly saw a revenue surge after announcing its lawsuit against the Trump administration’s efforts to slash the size of Bears Ears National Monument in Utah. My research with Michael Toffel of Harvard Business School finds that consumers were more likely to buy Apple products after hearing Tim Cook’s statement opposing Indiana’s religious freedom bill. But other firms have faced angry consumers and had to retrench, as Target did when hundreds of thousands of people signed a petition in protest of its trans-inclusive bathroom policy. The chief executive of Papa John’s, who blamed the National Football League’s handling of the national anthem controversy for his company’s declining sales, stepped down after he was criticized for his comments. What has not happened in any of these cases is a cooling of partisan tensions. Even in rare cases when pragmatic business leaders helped to broker agreements, which was reportedly the case in North Carolina with the repeal of the so-called bathroom bill, a culture war still festers. C.E.O. activism has typically not brought people together, working from the middle out. Instead, this type of activism, largely from the progressive side, has begun to galvanize conservatives. For example, in Georgia, lawmakers stripped tax breaks for Delta over its decision to cut ties with the N.R.A. In the short term, Dick’s will become another corporate poster child for how political polarization and so-called negative partisanship — an automatic rejection of members of the opposing party — are infecting our society. There will be a rash of news stories about increased sales from liberal consumers rushing into Dick’s stores to vote with their wallets. Conservative media will point to boycotts and highlight other retailers that are stepping in to serve disaffected consumers. But the real story will be the long game. C.E.O. activism represents a historic shift in the way corporations intersect with national politics. Rather than chief executives shaping political discourse, however, our toxic political environment is dictating corporate strategy. Instead of being cast as practical technocrats who could unite us, chief executives will be swept up in our cultural war, just like university presidents, celebrities, professional athletes and religious leaders before them. Brands are likely to become even more segmented into red and blue, strengthening the association between liberals and Priuses and conservatives and Cracker Barrel. Corporate brand campaigns could soon resemble political campaigns, with efforts to identify the most intensely loyal consumers for repeat purchases as opposed to attracting new ones. Mainstream brands may become as common as moderate politicians — that is, a rare, perhaps extinct, species in today’s political environment. Twitter and PayPal serve diverse customers today, but their recent efforts to regulate their own platforms have led to allegations of political bias and incited competitors. Most companies are not prepared for this new world of politics. Pepsi and Starbucks have already been victims of orchestrated fake news campaigns; there will be many more. As more companies take stands, those remaining will be named and shamed on social media, creating impossible choices in an environment where neutrality is not an option. Like our politicians, corporate chiefs will have to quickly figure out what stand they should take on the issue of the day by reflecting on their core convictions and estimating how their (customer) base will react. Like pollsters, they will have to assess which kind of consumers they can write off and which ones to curry favor with. The right answer will vary by a company’s geographic location, who their employees are and how much they depend on favorable government regulation. There is no going back. Lists are being kept and wins are being tallied by pressure groups aiming to get companies on their side. The issues that divide us will keep being served up in relentless succession, forcing companies to take stands on just about everything. Much of this is a reflection of who we have become. Corporate America thrives by selling us what we want, and they do that by appealing to our identities. In 2018, for many Americans, our political identity seems to define us more than ever. It already influences whom we socialize with on Facebook, whom we marry, what news we read and where we live. It was only a matter of time before this big sort started to shape our consumer behavior, too. Aaron K.

Opinion,88," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Robert Leonard KNOXVILLE, Iowa — As Democrats have fled rural America — or rural America has fled Democrats — many of them, living in cities, are left without an understanding of rural culture and its core values. If it isn’t on abortion, our deepest cultural divide might be on guns. The guns issue also has a profound political dimension, reliably driving rural Americans into Republican arms. It’s been many years since I hunted squirrels and rabbits with my Grandpa Leonard. I grew up around guns and remember the pride I had when I completed my N.R.A.-sponsored gun safety training in Boy Scouts, back when the N.R.A. was a group primarily known for teaching gun appreciation and safety rather than lobbying. I have come to understand and appreciate arguments for more gun control. But guns are important to the culture in my conservative community in Iowa, and people around here reject most gun control legislation. So I do my best to understand where they are coming from. One morning after the mass shootings in Parkland, Fla., I spoke about them with a police-officer friend. He has led active-shooter trainings in our schools. He believes that better background checks might help prevent some gun violence, and that people need to do a better job securing their firearms (especially from suicidal teenagers). But he doesn’t believe that significant gun control measures will ever meet approval in rural America, including a ban on AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles. He confided that many conservative police officers do not want more gun control and that other officers have told him that should they ever have to start taking guns away from people, they will quit their jobs. Like most rural conservatives, he truly believes that taking guns away from law-abiding citizens will never solve America’s gun problems, including mass shootings. He says gun control has never stopped criminals from getting guns, and never will. To understand why many conservatives in rural America believe this, you must start with first principles, because the argument ultimately isn’t about guns; it runs even deeper than the Second Amendment. At a 2015 campaign event during the Iowa caucuses, J. C. Watts, the former congressman from Oklahoma, spoke about perspectives on original sin. It helps illuminate the differences in worldview between many conservatives and liberals. Mr. Watts said Democrats think people were born basically good, so when good people did bad things, something in society (in this case, guns) needed to be controlled. Republicans think the fault lies with the person — the perpetrator of the evil. Bad choices result in bad things being done, in part because the perpetrator lacks the moral guidance the Christian faith provides. The reaction to mass shootings highlights this difference. Liberals blame the guns and want to debate gun control. For conservatives, the blame lies with the shooter, not the gun. To my conservative friends, it’s a matter of liberty and personal responsibility. Even after a horrific event like the school shooting in Florida, where 17 people were killed, more gun control would be compromising those first principles. For them, compromising those principles would be even more horrific and detrimental to society than any shooting. What my conservative friends see is not gun control, but rather control, period. Not everyone here is an N.R.A. nut, but they think the N.R.A. may be the last line of defense for the Second Amendment. The apocalyptic videos about gun control from the N.R.A. spokeswoman Dana Loesch are over the top, as my conservative friends here know, but they think they are fun for the basic reason that liberals grow faint after viewing them. Many people own guns because they simply enjoy them — shooting them, the feel of them, their history, their role in protection. They want guns for the same reason you might want a particular kind of car. They also believe that having a gun makes them less likely to become a victim. Here, guns are tools. We hunt with them. Because we live in a free country, we can have a great many things. But few of those things deserved special mention in our Constitution. Guns did. Throwing around statistics on shooting deaths in America will not make rural gun owners give up their guns. Make no mistake: These statistics and the deaths behind them sadden rural gun owners just as much as they sadden you. But again, where you might blame the guns, they don’t. They blame the shooters. I worry that the ready availability of guns contributes to the number of suicides in rural America. Nothing crushes a small town like a suicide, as nearly everyone knows the victim or a family member. I had a chat with a good friend the other day. He’s another law enforcement officer. He thinks the gun debate isn’t being framed in a productive way. He asked: “What are you, Bob? Pro-gun or anti-gun? Pro-Second Amendment or anti-Second Amendment?” “Pro-Second Amendment,” I said. “All in favor of rifles, shotguns and handguns. Concealed carry makes me nervous, but I guess I’m for it, and I want AR-15s and their kin banned.” “So, are you anti-gun or pro-gun?” “Well, I guess I don’t exactly know,” I replied. “Me neither,” he said. “I’m a lifelong hunter, but when I tell my friends I don’t want people with AR-15s slung over their shoulders at the county fair, some say I’m anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment, and I’m not. We need to frame this conversation differently before we can get anywhere.” I know those great kids from Parkland will accept only bans on AR-15s and more — I understand why — and some conservatives seem to be moving on age limits, background checks and perhaps on bump stocks. The Florida Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott have responded to the tragedy and raised the age on gun purchases. Maybe we are stumbling to a better sort of dialogue, led by these kids from Florida and students all over the country who walked out to protest gun violence. There is room for some compromise. For me, guns always bring to mind Grandpa Leonard. I remember the first time he took me hunting. He took a shot, and a squirrel fell from the branches of the oak. “Looks like we eat stew tonight,” he said. I retrieved the squirrel, still warm, in the cool Iowa summer morning, and laid it in the pile of four or five he had already shot. Grandpa Leonard was not a Republican but a devoted New Deal Democrat. He went to his grave knowing that the policies of President Franklin Roosevelt saved his family, including 11 children, from starvation during the Great Depression. Grandpa was a pro-union coal miner, a farm hand, a road crew worker, a boat builder and a factory worker. Today, many rural men just like him are dedicated Republicans. If Democrats want to engage rural America culturally and politically, they need to understand us, and at least some of our ideals.

Washington,90," By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVISFEB. 22, 2018 WASHINGTON — For more than an hour on Wednesday, President Trump listened quietly to entreaties for action, personal stories of grief and loss, and expressions of raw anger, clutching a white notecard with talking points written on it. “I hear you,” one said. “What would you most want me to know about your experience?” said another. Mr. Trump’s use of notes, captured by news photographers who covered the extraordinary listening session with parents, students and teachers who lost loved ones in the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., was not unusual. But the nature of Mr. Trump’s written prompts was atypical. Composed beneath a heading that read “The White House,” they seemed to suggest that the president needed to be reminded to show compassion and understanding to traumatized survivors, an impression that Mr. Trump has sometimes fed with public reactions to national tragedies that were criticized as callous.  On Wednesday, the president never uttered the talking points, but appeared by turns sympathetic, attentive, determined to take action and angry on behalf of his distraught guests. “I just grieve for you,” Mr. Trump told the group. “I feel so — it’s just, to me, there could be nothing worse than what you’ve gone through.”  Still, consoler in chief has been a role that the president has been slow and somewhat reluctant to embrace — especially in contrast to his predecessor. Images of Mr. Trump hurling rolls of paper towels at hurricane victims in Puerto Rico last year and grinning broadly for photographs with emergency medical workers from Parkland have illustrated the challenge. President Barack Obama’s staff would often prepare him with names and biographical details of people he would be encountering, news updates on the latest developments on an issue, and facts and figures he might want to cite in discussing it, according to Jen Psaki, his former communications director. “But there was no scenario where we were suggesting to him, or needing to remind him, how to react to something emotionally, and if we had, he would have looked at us like we were crazy people,” she said. Mr. Trump has said he believes that understanding and channeling the nation’s grief is a strong suit for him as president, assuring a reporter during his campaign that empathy “will be one of the strongest things about Trump.” But interactions with some of those involved in the Parkland shooting have not been as successful as those during the White House session. Samantha Fuentes, who was shot in both legs during the Parkland assault, said she had felt no reassurance during a phone call from the president to her hospital room last week. “He said he heard that I was a big fan of his, and then he said, ‘I’m a big fan of yours too.’ I’m pretty sure he made that up,” she said in an interview after being discharged from the hospital. “Talking to the president, I’ve never been so unimpressed by a person in my life. He didn’t make me feel better in the slightest.”  Ms. Fuentes, who was left with a piece of shrapnel lodged behind her right eye, said Mr. Trump had called the gunman a “sick puppy” and said “‘oh boy, oh boy, oh boy,’ like, seven times.” The account of the call was reminiscent of the last time Mr. Trump drew public scrutiny for his reaction to a tragedy, with his private condolence call to Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson, one of four American soldiers killed in an attack in Niger.      In that case, in October, Ms. Johnson said she had been deeply offended by Mr. Trump’s words and tone, saying that he had not referred to her husband by name, calling him only “your guy,” and had upset her by saying that Mr. Johnson “knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyway.” Mr. Trump quickly lashed out on Twitter, saying he had spoken respectfully to the widow. Colleagues said Mr. Trump’s notes on Wednesday were written by Hope Hicks, his communications director and longtime aide, who had briefed the president along with Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, before he attended the session. The president’s aides had been well aware that he might confront an emotional and potentially volatile situation when he sat down with grief-stricken parents and students, as well as others who had been living with loss for years or even decades. They decided to allow news cameras to capture the entire session anyway. In private beforehand, Mr. Trump met in the Oval Office with Andrew Pollack, whose 18-year-old daughter, Meadow, was one of the 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last week. “He showed us nothing but love,” Mr. Pollack said in an interview. “The guy really cared, you know? He flew us in, he had a bus waiting for us, he made time for us.” Mr. Pollack, who brought his wife, two sons and Meadow’s longtime boyfriend, said Mr. Trump signed his son’s white and gold “Make America Great Again” trucker hat and spoke at length with the family. The president insisted that he and his family, who had not planned to attend the listening session, accompany him through the iconic White House colonnade and into the event. “He took pictures of my daughter that we brought, and he said he was going to look at it every day,” Mr. Pollack said.  “He just said, ‘You guys are coming with me,’ and we were just talking about life as we walked,” Mr. Pollack said. “He’s a regular guy. I wouldn’t have been there if I didn’t think he cared.” But another participant in the White House session, Samuel Zeif, an 18-year-old student at Stoneman Douglas High School who survived the shooting and spoke tearfully at the White House on Wednesday of the experience, said Mr. Trump had done little to comfort or console him. He said he had been particularly stung to see pictures of the notecard after it was over. “Everything I said was directly from the heart, and he had to write down ‘I hear you,’” Mr. Zeif said in an interview. “Half the time during that meeting, his arms were crossed — I kept wanting to say, ‘Mr. President, uncross your arms.’ To me, that is the international sign for closemindedness; it’s really just a big ‘no.’” Mr. Zeif, who called for banning assault weapons, said the president had seemed affected by the session, but not moved enough to act. “He may have heard us, but he’s never going to feel what we feel, because his kids are protected by the people that came to save me and my classmates that day,” Mr. Zeif said. Nick Madigan contributed reporting from Miami and Mark Leibovich from Washington.

Express,91," By MICHAEL GOLDAPRIL 19, 2018 High school students across the United States are planning to walk out of classes all day on Friday as part of the National School Walkout, a protest against what participants see as political inaction in the face of mass shootings and gun violence. The event, which grew out of a petition on Change.org, comprises more than 2,000 walkouts nationwide, with at least one planned in every U.S. state and the District of Columbia. With thousands of students expected to participate, here’s what you can expect from Friday’s walkout. The National School Walkout is being staged on April 20, a date intended to mark the 19th anniversary of the mass shooting at Columbine High School in 1999. At the time, the Columbine shooting, in which 13 people were killed, was the deadliest school shooting on record.  Participants in the walkout will be leaving their classes at 10 a.m. local time. Students are expected to exit their school buildings for the day. Organizers have called on people to wear orange, a color that has become associated with the gun control movement.  After they leave their buildings, participants will gather to observe 13 seconds of silence that are meant to honor the 13 victims in the Columbine shooting. Following that, further activities are up to the leaders of each school’s individual protest. National organizers have called for daylong activism. In a planning guide on the National School Walkout’s website, organizers encourage participants to hold marches, participate in voter-registration drives and set up speeches. The idea for the National School Walkout came from Lane Murdock, a high school sophomore from Ridgefield, Conn., about 20 miles from Newtown, the site of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. In the Change.org petition that Ms. Murdock started, she cited the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February as a catalyst for the event. “It is time for teenagers to speak their minds and put their frustration into action,” she wrote. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     Ms. Murdock has been working with a team of other students at her high school to coordinate the national protest. Individual walkouts at schools are being organized and staged by local students. The walkout’s website says the event has three goals: to “hold elected officials accountable,” to advocate “solutions to gun violence” and to encourage students to be more engaged in politics.  More specifically, the event seeks to push Congress to pass legislation to halt gun violence. Among the specific requests are bills to strengthen the background check process for gun purchases; a ban on bump stock attachments, which allow semiautomatic guns to fire like automatic weapons; and raising the minimum age to purchase assault-style weapons to 21. Organizers are also encouraging participants to pressure state and local governments to enact similar laws. They are also seeking to increase voter registration among younger Americans in the hopes of electing candidates who support gun control. On March 14, one month after 17 people were killed in the Parkland shooting, students across the United States stepped out of their classrooms at 10 a.m. to call for stronger gun control laws. Students left schools by the hundreds and thousands, sometimes in defiance of school administrators and school boards. In some cities, including New York, participants in the walkout then staged protests or marches. The walkouts in March were the first major nationally coordinated action of a student-driven movement for gun control that was sparked by the Parkland shooting. Still, many students did not participate, especially in more conservative and rural parts of the country where gun control is not in wide favor. Ten days later, on March 24, demonstrators gathered in Washington, D.C., for the March for Our Lives rally, as well as at more than 800 protests held around the world to call for action against gun violence. The walkout held last month was much briefer, scheduled to last for 17 minutes, one minute to honor each of the Parkland victims. In practice, some students continued to protest for the rest of the day. This walkout on Friday is intended to last an entire school day. The National School Walkout also comes as attention to the Parkland shooting has faded somewhat. Despite efforts by the student-driven movement, neither Congress nor the White House has taken significant action on gun control and gun safety measures. Congress did pass a spending bill in March that included measures to provide grants for school safety and to improve reporting to the background check system for gun purchases. Gun regulation advocates have seen victory in Florida, three weeks after the Parkland shooting, Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill with some of the limits that students have been urging. But some have argued the legislation did not go far enough.  On their website, organizers for the National School Walkout wrote that they see their event as part of a larger push to advocate gun control and that the issues they are addressing need “constant attention if we hope to change anything.”  ",2018-04-19,0.073769264,Thursday
Opinion,92," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Eliza Sydnor Romm Ms. Romm is a descendent of a founder of Smith & Wesson, the gun manufacturer. In the early 1880s, legend has it that Daniel B. Wesson, a co-founder of Smith & Wesson, the gun manufacturer, heard about a child who injured himself by cocking the hammer and pulling the trigger of one of his firm’s revolvers. Wesson, known as D. B., was so distraught about the accident that he and his son, Joseph, developed a more child-safe revolver that they called the .38 Safety Hammerless. Wesson was also my great-great-great-grandfather. Though it has been half a century since my family was involved with Smith & Wesson, I feel a twinge of responsibility every time a mass shooting occurs. I realize this is not entirely rational: I play no part in making or selling firearms and have never lost anyone close to me from gun violence. But it still haunts me. After 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., I learned the shooter used a Smith & Wesson M&P 15, a version of an AR-15 military-style rifle. So I had to ask myself: What would D. B. Wesson have wanted his company to do? Would he have accepted the repeated refrain, “Guns don’t kill people, people kill people”? Obviously I cannot know what D. B. Wesson would want. But I would like to believe that he would have recoiled in horror and disbelief at the weapons created by the brand still bearing his name. And that he would have wanted all of us to ask more of his company today. It is only fair for me, for all of us, to demand that our gun manufacturers become leaders in this national discussion around gun violence. They create products designed to kill human beings. The responsibility that must accompany the creation of weapons like an AR-15 is too large to be brushed aside by shouting about freedom and an amendment to our Constitution ratified in 1791. Yes, the company and other gun makers have taken some steps in calling for better enforcement of the national background check system and sponsoring firearm safety programs. But they can do so much more. I would start by asking the parent company of Smith & Wesson, American Outdoor Brands Corporation, to push for gun-violence research. Since 1996 the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been severely restricted in researching  gun violence. If gun manufacturers are truly responsible organizations, they should wholeheartedly want to back this research as a public health concern. Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the C.D.C. from 2009 to 2017, asked Congress repeatedly to fund research in gun-violence prevention but never succeeded. In response to recent questions from BlackRock, an investment firm that owns the largest share of American Outdoor Brands, the gun maker’s president, James Debney, and chairman, Barry M. Monheit, said, “We must collectively have the courage to ensure any actions are guided by data, by facts and by what will actually make us safer.” Sounds like Mr. Debney, Mr. Monheit and Dr. Frieden are on the same page, so let’s see Smith & Wesson lead the charge in renewing gun-violence research by the C.D.C. I would also ask that the company publicly endorse the Brady Campaign’s Gun Dealer Code of Conduct. It should support requiring universal background checks and a national registry for tracking its products, and indeed all firearms. These measures would help prevent weapons from falling into the hands of the wrong people and make it easier for law enforcement to trace guns used in illegal activities. The refrain that criminals will always get their hands on a weapon, no matter what a gun manufacturer does, is apathetic and unacceptable. What will you do to make it better? Most obvious of all, Smith & Wesson should be pushing to require that all people who buy firearms undergo formal weapons training. Why would any responsible gun manufacturer not want a buyer trained extensively in how to properly use its very dangerous weapon? Do more than you are doing now. Have a purpose other than making money. Take part in this national discussion. Beyond expressions of sympathy, show the families of the victims of Parkland and Newtown and Columbine and Las Vegas and every nameless gun-violence tragedy occurring every day that you care about their pain and suffering. D. B. Wesson was a brilliant inventor who created a better gun than anyone had imagined in the 19th century. When he died in 1906, his guns had made him a multimillionaire. But he also cared deeply about the health and welfare of families and children. In his will, he left $450,000, the equivalent of more than $11 million in today’s money, for a hospital specializing in homeopathic medicine that was built a few years before he died and for the construction of another hospital to provide maternity care. If hearing about one child injured in the 1880s led him to invent the .38 Safety Hammerless, what would the more than 7,000 children killed or injured each year in the United States from gun violence stir in him? I believe if he could, he would beg the executives running Smith & Wesson today to stand up and join the fight to stop this bloodshed any way possible. Eliza Sydnor Romm, a distant relative of a co-founder of Smith & Wesson, the gun manufacturer, is a small-business owner living in North Carolina.

National,93," By JULIE TURKEWITZMARCH 24, 2018 SALT LAKE CITY — Dallas Johnson, 18, stood at the top of a hill here on Saturday, flanked by men with pistols and children gripping protest signs. He held a pole, and a giant flag flapped above him, bearing a rifle and a message in black: “Come and take it.” Hundreds of thousands of people marched in cities on Saturday calling on officials to enact stricter gun laws, but they were not the only ones to demonstrate. Across the country, supporters of the Second Amendment gathered at state capitals and in city centers, hoping to counter the swell that has emerged in the wake of a February massacre that killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Their message in many cases was that the surviving Parkland students have it all wrong — more guns, not fewer, is what will end the violence that has ripped through so many American communities.  “What can we do to stop mass shootings?” said one of the many signs at the rally here. “SHOOT BACK.”  In Montana, more than 100 supporters of gun rights gathered at the state Capitol in Helena, where several children held a placard declaring students in gun-free zones to be “sitting ducks.” In Arizona, Second Amendment proponents carried rifles through Phoenix, sometimes clashing with other protesters. In Salt Lake City, the rally drew 500 participants, according to an estimate by the police. In Boston, where Second Amendment supporters gathered in front of the Statehouse, the organizer Paul Allen, 62, a retired construction worker, described supporters of gun control as “ignorant sheep who are being spoon-fed by liberal teachers.” “They haven’t read the Constitution,” he said, “and they don’t know what it means.” In Utah, the rally for gun rights began outside a high school with a prayer, “The Star-Spangled Banner” and shouts of “Long live freedom!” In one corner stood Brandon McKee, 46, with a firearm on his belt and his 11-year-old daughter, Kendall, by his side. Kendall wore braces and a hat that said “unicorn” across the band. “I’m tired of sitting on the sidelines,” said Mr. McKee, who works as a delivery man for a local school district. “The other side is passionate and they are well organized. And it’s time that we stand up for our rights before they get taken away.” 
                Crowds gathered in cities across the United States and around the world.             He explained why he carries his gun at all times. “When emergencies happen, cops are minutes away when seconds count,” he said. “I can’t depend on anybody else to defend me or my family.” The march set off down a wide avenue, but tensions erupted almost immediately as a single infiltrator — Linda Peer, 67, from Torrey, Utah — took to the front of the line, holding a sign calling for stricter gun laws.      The pro-gun group heckled her. “She’s not a true American!” yelled a man in an orange jacket. “Shame on you!” the group chanted as she darted between protesters with her sign. “Shame on you! Shame on you!”  The marchers passed several Mormon Church buildings, with the man in orange still heckling her, and then climbed a hill to the Capitol, where they ascended a series of white steps. A man in camouflage turned his attention to a woman on the steps who appeared to be part of a gun control group. “You don’t even know what you’re talking about,” he shouted at her. “Are you even from this country?” The counterprotest in Salt Lake City was organized by Bryan Melchior, co-owner of the Utah Gun Exchange, a website that sells firearms. Mr. Melchior said he recently had met many young people who felt that the growing call for stricter gun laws did not represent their views. Among them was Cody Frandsen, 17, a high school senior wearing a “Make America Great Again” baseball cap. “I feel like an outsider,” said Mr. Frandsen, standing with friends who nodded in agreement. “A lot of the millennials, our age group, is left-leaning.” The group began talking about gun laws it might be able to support. “I’m totally for a background check,” said Mr. Frandsen, noting that he supported universal checks. “I think there should be a mental health check” before purchasing a gun, said his friend Logan Coffey, 17. “And the government should know where every single firearm is.” Of those who marched in Washington in support of gun control, Mr. Frandsen said he did not agree with anything “they have to say,” adding, “But I’m sure we could come up with some kind of compromise.” Katharine Seelye and Jeffery C. Mays contributed reporting. A version of this article appears in print on March 25, 2018, on Page A23 of the New York edition with the headline: Rallies for 2nd Amendment Try to Have a Say, Too.

Opinion,95," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Joseph Heithaus MONTEVERDE, Costa Rica — “It’s catastrophic. There really are no words.” I read that statement from the Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, on the morning after Ash Wednesday — and Valentine’s Day — on a computer screen more than a thousand miles from Parkland, Fla., in a rented house on a mountainside in Costa Rica. On that day, my 19-year-old daughter came home from the Quaker school where she is living out a gap year, and before she or I had heard the awful news, said: “Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. The president of Costa Rica visited the school today. It was after Meeting.” On Wednesday mornings, the school gathers in silence for 45 minutes. It is an open Meeting, so there’s a scattering of the old among the young. In our seven months here, I’ve attended a handful of Wednesday Meetings. Those moved to speak, even the smallest, say their words in either Spanish or English. A bilingual student from the upper grades is always assigned to translate. The youngest, kindergartners and first graders, come for only a short time. Those in the grades just above are given Play-Doh — something to do with their hands. The older students have “little siblings.” My daughter has my wife’s magnetism for kids, and so she often has her little sib sitting on her lap and a small group of girls around her. This Wednesday, she sat with a small gaggle of girls as President Luis Guillermo Solís, who had arrived as a special guest just after the meeting, spoke to the children, wearing his hiking clothes. He’d come to inspect the roads that had been damaged by Tropical Storm Nate and had apparently hiked a bit in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological Reserve. The children sang him a song they all know by heart. “Paz y libertad,” they sang. “Para los niños de todo el mundo/queremos paz y libertad.” For the children of all the world, we want peace and freedom. They also sang their wish to end hunger and war. While these children sang, took selfies and posed for a group picture with their outgoing president, a massacre was happening at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. The song’s lyrics, cranked through the machine of the American media and entering the ears of those shaped by it, might be dismissed by some as the unrealistic garble of the left or lauded by others as what a former president once called “the audacity of hope.” This is not simple. These are children parroting this country’s ideals and the ideals of the Quaker community that is providing them, at a price paid by their parents, a private education. This is not a commercial for Costa Rica. In this very town in 2005, a bank robbery that turned into a hostage crisis left nine people dead. This country has its problems too. But since I’m returning to the United States in a few months, I want to believe that a vast majority of my fellow citizens would try to hear the words sung by the children as something free from any political leaning. That the song and the example of this small country, with its commitment to peace, the preservation of nature, and law and order of a kind quite different from one promoting the idea that each of us carry a gun, might give them some solace in a difficult time. Mr. Solís is a politician and of course spoke of politics — he assured the assembly that in the coming run-off election, which will take place on Easter Sunday, they will be in good hands regardless of the outcome. But he spoke of the children, too, and of the resillience of this community. Whether we like it or not, there are probably too many words. But I think when Sheriff Israel made his statement, it was partly an appeal to us to listen to one another or listen, for a time, to nothing at all. To observe silence. If I’ve learned anything in living among the Quakers of Costa Rica, it is that intentional and focused dwelling in quiet is a space at once empty and rich with possibility, for both individuals and communities. At moments like this, listening to one another is perhaps our only hope for avoiding catastrophes like this one, where in the aftermath, there really are no words.

Here are some compelling photos of the demonstrations, from Chicago to Washington to outside Denver. (Read more about the protests, too.) They gathered inside and outside their schools, and in gyms and hallways and on football fields.

National,97," By ALAN BLINDER, JESS BIDGOOD and VIVIAN WANGMARCH 25, 2018 They were rallies that would not have happened without the fervor of the students: teenage survivors of last month’s massacre in Parkland, Fla., frightened high schoolers in the Midwest, unnerved university students in the Northeast. But the March for Our Lives demonstrations that unfolded on Saturday, from Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington to the streets of Salt Lake City to a small town in north Georgia, ultimately represented twin triumphs: of organic, youthful grass-roots energy, and of sophisticated, experienced organizational muscle. Although the events, which together drew hundreds of thousands of demonstrators across the country, were inspired and often led by students, many protests simultaneously benefited from groups with more financial resources and organizational skills than the teenagers had on their own. “We definitely teamed up,” said Madison Knoop, 18, who organized a rally of 2,500 in Montpelier, Vt., with the support of groups dominated by adults. “They were so helpful for the entire process.”  Skeptics of the marches seized on the roles of major interest groups, suggesting that the students were unwitting participants in political warfare that should be reserved for adults. But organizers and supporters of Saturday’s events have done little to disguise that millions of dollars and thousands of hours were directed toward the weekend’s protests.  Everytown for Gun Safety, which was founded and financed by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire and former New York mayor, proudly declared that it had doled out more than $1 million in grants to local organizers. A nonprofit led by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, arranged for more than 200 people from the Parkland area to attend Saturday’s march in Washington, and said it had worked with the owner of the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft, to use the N.F.L. franchise’s plane to bring some people to the capital. In Washington, volunteers staffed medical tents, the restaurateur José Andrés used one of his kitchens to prepare thousands of ham-and-cheese sandwiches, and a popular chain handed out personal-size pizzas to children. “Our mission was to give them the biggest megaphone possible,” Shannon Watts, the founder of an Everytown-affiliated group, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said on Sunday. “I think what yesterday showed was every generation wants to get involved in this effort, and they want to get off the sidelines.” Established groups and high-profile supporters were not the exclusive sources of money and organizing strength nationwide. As of Sunday, a GoFundMe page affiliated with the march in Washington had raised nearly $3.5 million. Half of the crowdsourced money was expected to help pay for Saturday’s protest, with the balance going to people directly affected by the Feb. 14 attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Yet the role of leading gun control groups and advocates, and even local organizers, has plainly aggravated and frustrated critics of Saturday’s marches. Breitbart, the conservative website, said the events were “directed, promoted and funded by left-wing adults and adult-led organizations.” Although adults were involved in some planning — an organizer listed on the National Park Service permit for the march in Washington, for example, is a prominent activist from California — there is little doubt that students were crucial to orchestrating Saturday’s events. In Washington, the area seemed to influence the program, which included Parkland students and celebrity guests but also a choir from Baltimore and remarks from a local 11-year-old girl. “The kids did everything,” said Jenn Hoadley, 36, who helped students organize a march in Anchorage. “All I did was say, ‘You want a stage? Cool. I’ll find one for you. You need a sound system? Cool. I’ll find one for you. You want to march in the park? I do paperwork to help you get that done.’ They planned it all, and they should be given credit for that.”  In New York, a Facebook group, envisioned to coordinate the efforts of about 30 friends and classmates to attend a march, swelled into the planning apparatus for the city’s major event. The group’s creator, Alex Clavering, a Columbia Law School student, was quickly regarded as the official organizer.      So that was what he became. He convened meetings and established a fund-raising effort. He applied for a city parade permit — at first, he recalled, for a turnout of 3,000 to 5,000 people. By the end of the first week, he had changed it to 30,000 people. (The mayor’s office ultimately estimated that nearly 200,000 people marched on Saturday.) The early days, Mr. Clavering, 26, said, were “decentralized, figuring it out, being scrappy.” But more established gun control groups soon got in touch, offering to connect him to others and, eventually, to pick up expenses that included lighting, sound equipment and stages. Mr. Clavering’s GoFundMe campaign raised more than $25,000, but he said the cost for the entire event was likely around $100,000. And although groups like Everytown provided the infrastructure and expertise, Mr. Clavering, who had never before planned an event of such scale, said they always remained hands-off. They left the decision-making to a core group of about 20 student organizers. In Vermont, Ms. Knoop, a freshman at Johnson State College, recalled how she popped into a few Vermont-centric Facebook groups in February to see if anyone was planning an event in her state. She was quickly advised to check in with the people who would know: Women’s March Vermont. “I just messaged them and I was like, ‘Do you know if anything is happening yet?’ and they were like, ‘No, we were waiting for a youth to come forward who wanted to lead the event.’” Ms. Knoop said Women’s March officials shared their organizing skills and spreadsheets with contact information for politicians, media outlets and other organizations that might want to help out. Ms. Knoop applied for a permit to hold a rally on the steps of the gold-topped, Greek Revival State House in Montpelier and said a group called the Peace & Justice Center handled the liability insurance. And Ms. Knoop worked with Gun Sense Vermont, which advocates tighter gun laws in the state. The group also helped with planning and managed the event’s finances, including one of the grants Everytown issued. “They handled the finances, any donations we got, they were paying for everything, which was really, really helpful,” Ms. Knoop said.  And there were business contributions. Ben & Jerry’s, the ice cream maker, paid for buses to shuttle demonstrators to Montpelier. That left Ms. Knoop to attend long weekly planning meetings in Burlington, about an hour away from her school. She used the time she had between classes to send emails and make phone calls to hammer out logistics for the rally. “I definitely fell back in school a bit for it,” Ms. Knoop said, “but to me, that was worth it.” Reporting was contributed by Jill Burke, Jose A. Del Real, Julie Turkewitz and Noah Weiland.

Express,98," By LOUIS LUCERO IIMARCH 24, 2018 Emma González, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., used her speech at the March for Our Lives rally in Washington to remember classmates who had been killed. Emma González spoke for just under two minutes on Saturday before tens of thousands of demonstrators at the March for Our Lives rally in Washington, describing the effects of gun violence in emotional detail and reciting the names of classmates who had been killed. Then she said nothing for four minutes and 26 seconds. Ms. González, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., has emerged as one of the most prominent faces among the student activists who have mobilized against gun violence after a shooting at their school last month that left 17 dead. Their facility with social media has added urgency to demands for more gun control. Ms. González, who has more than 1.3 million followers on Twitter, has spent much of the last month urging her audience to turn out for Saturday’s marches. She stared straight ahead during her period of silence onstage, her sometimes watery eyes fixed in the distance. Then a timer went off.  “Since the time that I came out here, it has been six minutes and 20 seconds,” she said. “The shooter has ceased shooting, and will soon abandon his rifle, blend in with the students as they escape, and walk free for an hour before arrest.  “Fight for your lives, before it’s someone else’s job,” she continued, and then walked offstage. Ms. González’s speech was a poignant moment during a day of demonstrations filled with emotional displays. At gatherings across the country, speakers — most of them students — denounced gun violence and committed to “stop at nothing” until their elected leaders took action to prevent it. Photos from the day’s events suggest that the calls for action against gun violence may be catching on in ways they had not after previous mass shootings. Other demonstrators communicated their opposition to any further restrictions on guns with similar fervor, though in much smaller numbers, in scattered protests across the country.

Magazine,99,"In the wake of mass shootings, a lifetime of gun ownership leads to unsettling questions. By DAVID JOYAPRIL 2, 2018 Two weeks before Christmas, I had a 9-millimeter pistol concealed in my waistband and a rifle with two 30-round magazines in the passenger seat beside me. I was driving down from the mountains to meet a fellow I didn’t know at a Cracker Barrel off I-40 in the North Carolina foothills. He was looking to buy a Kel-Tec Sub-2000, and I had one for sale. Other than that, I didn’t know him from Adam except for a few messages back and forth on Facebook. We were both members of a Facebook group where people post pictures of firearms and buyers private-message to ask questions and make offers — sometimes cash, sometimes trade. I needed money to pay a buddy for an old ’70s model Lark teardrop trailer, and that rifle wasn’t doing anything but taking up space in the safe. What I was doing was perfectly legal. In North Carolina, long-gun transfers by private sellers require no background checks. Likewise, it’s perfectly legal to sell a handgun privately so long as the buyer has a purchase permit or a concealed-carry license. But as I headed up the exit to the restaurant where we agreed to meet, I felt uneasy. I was within the law, but it didn’t feel as if I should have been. He was backed into a space parallel to the dumpster, a black Ford F-250 with a covered bed, just as he described on Facebook Messenger. As I pulled in, he stepped out. He smiled, and I nodded.  “You can just leave it in the seat so we don’t make anybody nervous,” he said as I rolled down my window. There were families in rocking chairs in front of the restaurant. Customers were walking to their cars to get back on the road.  I climbed out of my truck so he could look the rifle over while I counted the money he’d left on his seat. He was about my age, somewhere in his early to mid-30s, white guy with a thick beard. He spoke with a heavy Southern accent not much different from my own. Said he built houses for a living, and that was about all the small talk between us. He liked the rifle. I needed the cash. We shook hands, and off we went. There is rarely a moment when I’m not within reach of a firearm. When I lie down at night, there is an old single-shot New England Firearms Pardner leaned against the headboard, a loaded Smith & Wesson M&P Shield pistol on the nightstand. When I sit on the couch to work on an essay or a novel, there is a CZ 75 pistol on the coffee table. When I go to town for groceries, one of those two pistols is concealed inside my waistband. Where I live in the mountains of North Carolina, I am not alone. With fewer than a dozen guns in the safe, I wouldn’t even be considered a gun nut. Most of my friends have concealed-carry licenses and pistols on their person. If there are 10 of us in a room, there are most likely 10 loaded firearms, probably more, with a few of us keeping backups in ankle holsters. Rarely do we mention what we carry. We don’t touch the guns or draw them from their holsters. They are unseen and unspoken of, but always there. I can’t remember a time in my life when I wasn’t around guns. When I was a kid, there was a gun rack hanging on the wall in the living room. My father kept a single-shot .410 and an old bolt action .22, small-game guns, though he didn’t hunt anymore. I can remember watching older boys shoot skeet at a junkyard in the woods behind my house, my fingers plugged in my ears while orange clays turned to smoke against a backdrop of post oak and poplar. I can remember the first time my father taught me to shoot a rifle, how he had me sit on the concrete driveway and use my knee for a rest, aiming for a cardboard target in a honeysuckle thicket across the road. I think I was 8 or 9. I pulled the stock in too high on my shoulder, and craned my neck awkwardly to line up the iron sights. I didn’t know what I was doing, but I knew the rules: Always assume a firearm is loaded. Always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction. Know your target and what’s beyond it. I come from a country people whose culture was destroyed by bulldozers and buildings. My father’s family settled in and around Charlotte in the late 1700s. As a child, I would ride around with my grandmother in her light blue Oldsmobile. Where Winn-Dixies and Food Lions stood, she remembered fields where she worked tobacco and picked cotton. I grew up in a tiny holdout spot of country where I ran through a pasture of chest-high field grass to fish a farm pond most evenings, where just a mile down the road my uncle still kept a kennel of hounds to run rabbit each fall. Guns were often a bridge between father and son. But my dad didn’t keep a .38 Special on the bedside nightstand like my best friend’s father down the street. I never walked into the house and found him cleaning and oiling a dozen pistols at the kitchen table the way I did with my next-door neighbor’s dad. For my family, guns had always been a means of putting food on the table. My father never owned a handgun. He kept nothing for home defense. I was in eighth grade the first time I had a gun put to my head. It was December 1997, a year and four months before Columbine, at my middle school in Charlotte.  A teacher named Mr. Madison sent me and three other boys outside to look for stuff to put under a microscope — rocks, tree bark, empty snail shells, anything we could find. The school was located in a neighborhood three miles from downtown. A sewer line ran parallel and cut a wide trail through the woods between two residential streets. We were at the edge of the clearing. I saw someone walking up with a hood over his head. When he got close, he pulled the gun and jammed it into my temple. I can remember that it was a little snub-nosed revolver, a brushed-steel frame. I can remember what it felt like pressed into the side of my head, how my heart raced when I went for my wallet, how I couldn’t breathe. I had $50 my grandmother sent me for my birthday. My mom was going to take me to a skateboard shop after school to buy a new deck. There have been times I wondered what might’ve happened if it’d been like every other day, if I hadn’t had a dollar to my name. If my wallet had been empty, would he have just walked away or become so frustrated that he pulled the trigger? Luckily, I had the money, and he took the $50 and ran. When he was gone, the four of us rushed for the classroom and tried to tell Mr. Madison what happened, our words broken by shattered breath, him screaming: “Slow down! Slow down!” The rest of the day we recounted our story over and over to the principal. In the end, what happened was swept under the rug. My parents said the school was probably trying to keep the story off the news. When I was 14, I couldn’t imagine the impact that robbery would have on the rest of my life. I couldn’t foresee a grown man feeling uncomfortable when he was corralled by passers-by on the street, an unnerving anxiety turning him to stone when he was surrounded by strangers. I remember an afternoon in my early 30s at a therapist’s office describing the years that followed that incident, and she speculated that I surrounded myself with the people I did as a form of protection. There’s a part of me that thinks that’s too easy an answer, that it’s passing the buck instead of taking responsibility. But for those next few years, I ran around wild. I sat in the back of a police cruiser praying the officers wouldn’t pop the trunk on the car parked in front of my truck, knowing my friend had a shotgun and a quarter pound of weed sitting on the spare. I rode in the passenger seat while a buddy rolled down the window and fired a pistol into the night, blowing off steam after a breakup, empty casings spitting against the windshield. I dropped to the ground as gunfire rang from a car at a bonfire party. I pushed friends behind the brick foundation of a house as a shootout erupted over pills. There were times when someone could have easily been shot and killed. The second and last time I had a gun put to my head it was by the police. After a drunken fight, I left a friend’s apartment to walk five miles and sleep on the porch of a buddy’s house across the river. I was walking down the side of Wilkinson Boulevard in Belmont. I was carrying a shoe box. I saw a police cruiser pass me and make a U-turn at a stoplight up ahead. When the Crown Vic came back, the driver jumped the median and next thing I knew there were multiple cars, lights flashing, officers ordering me to the ground. They had their guns drawn. There was a K-9 unit, and the German shepherd wouldn’t quit barking. I was lying flat on my stomach, and one officer came forward and put his knee in my back, his service weapon pushed into the base of my skull. They let the dog close enough that I could feel him barking against my ear. They said I matched the description of someone who’d burglarized some houses nearby. They asked what was in the shoe box, and I stuttered, “Papers.” They asked if they opened the box if there was anything inside that would hurt them. With my face in the grass and the officer’s weight making it hard to breathe, I was so terrified that I couldn’t mutter a single word. I just shook my head, and they opened that box to find nothing but a stack of notebook papers, a pile of half-assed stories I’d written. They told me I could get up, and I stood there trembling while they apologized. They gave me a ride across the river and dropped me off at the Mecklenburg County line, told me they were sorry but they couldn’t take me any farther. I moved to the mountains not long after that. As soon as I arrived in Jackson County, I knew I’d never leave. A hundred and fifty miles west of where I grew up, I found a community that reminded me of my grandmother, where folks still kept big gardens and canned the vegetables they grew. They still filled the freezer with meat taken by rod and rifle — trout and turkey, dove and rabbit, deer, bear, anything in season.  I keep a close-knit group of friends here, most of whom are at least 20 years my senior. Our generational difference is erased by a shared passion for wilderness and time spent in the field with gun in hand. This past Christmas, one of the men I hunt with, a man we call Son in Law, handed down a Model 94 Winchester to his grandson. The grandson would be the fourth generation to hunt with that rifle. A few weeks later, the boy took that .30-30 lever action into the field and killed his first deer with it — the same as his uncle, his grandfather and great-grandfather. Those types of things are rare now, even in places like Appalachia. I’m the youngest member of my hunting camp — me 34, everyone else in their mid-to-late 60s, a few on up past 70. Among these men, there are centuries of experience gathered around the campfire each night. After more than 40 seasons wandering the same woods, they’ve come to know the land intimately. They toss around names — the Owl Boxes, the U.F.O. Hole, the Refrigerator Stand — places they’ve killed deer for decades. They tell stories about men who have died, hunters like Goat Man, who carried an onion in his pocket and plowed down trees in his beat-up Bronco; or Hawkeye, who ran moonshine and damn near drank a boy to death after the kid slapped a sack of weed on the poker table and declared, “Boys, that’s the shit that killed Elvis.” The old men talk, and I listen. I killed my biggest deer to date on the 2nd of November from a tree one of those men sent me to. Fifteen feet up a hickory, I watched a tree line at the edge of a clear cut. I heard heavy footsteps and eased around the right side of the tree for a look, and there he stood. The buck walked to my left, and I slipped behind the trunk, shouldered the rifle and balanced the fore end on a tree step I’d augured into the opposite side for a rest. He was broadside when I slid the cross hairs onto his shoulder. The clear cut, strewn with downed timber and studded with sawed stubs, was too rough to track and drag, so I didn’t want to risk a shot for heart and lungs and have the deer run a hundred yards. I wanted to drop him where he stood. Pin his shoulders together and buckle him.      Just before the deer strolled behind a cedar sapling, I touched the trigger, and the .308 blew apart the morning. A hundred and fifty grains of copper-jacketed lead hit just behind the shoulder and blood-shot the backside to pudding. The buck stooped forward and sprinted, back legs driving him over tangled ground. He made it 40 yards before he crashed. From my stand, I could just make out the white of his stomach through the brush. I watched his ribs rise with each breath, that breathing slowing, slowing, then gone. There is a sadness that only hunters know, a moment when lament overshadows any desire for celebration. Life is sustained by death, and though going to the field is an act of taking responsibility for that fact, the killing is not easy, nor should it be. I climbed down a half-hour later but didn’t walk straight to the deer. Instead I went to the place where I shot him, a yard shy of that cedar sapling, and followed the blood trail to where he lay. He was a big-bodied eight-point that would feed me for a year. I knelt there and ran my hands across his coat. It took nearly an hour to drag him back to the trail, another half-mile from there to the truck. A few days later, I was driving back home from hunting camp in McCormick, S.C., with the head of that eight-point in a cooler in the truck bed, the rest of the deer hanging to age at the processor. On a long straightaway, I passed a state trooper driving in the opposite direction. In the rearview, I saw him slam on the brakes and make a U-turn in the middle of the road, blue lights flashing. I was running just under 60 in a 55 and didn’t think there was any way he was pulling me over. The 9-millimeter I always carry was loaded and concealed on my side. Until that moment I’d never been pulled over while carrying a concealed weapon. I knew the protocol. I knew what I was legally obligated to say. But I was nervous as hell as the trooper stepped out of his cruiser, situated his campaign hat and approached the side of my truck.  He was a young black man with braces on his teeth. He looked to be in his early 20s, had kind eyes and was built like a linebacker. He asked for my license and registration, and I told him I needed to inform him that I had a concealed-carry license and that there was a weapon on my person. He asked where the gun was located, and I told him roughly 4 o’clock. He asked if I could get to my wallet, and I told him the pistol was pretty close to my back pocket. There was a moment of hesitation when he considered what to do next. Then he told me to move slowly as I took my wallet from my pocket. When the trooper had my license and registration, he went to his cruiser. In a few minutes, he came back to the window and issued me a warning for speeding. I asked if there was anything I could’ve done differently to make him more comfortable when he first approached the truck. The trooper told me what I’d said was fine. He said that some officers might have been uncomfortable with where the pistol was located, being holstered near my wallet, but that he felt we had a good rapport. Depending on the officer, some might have asked me to step out of the truck so they could remove the weapon. He smiled and told me: “But this is South Carolina. Most every car I pull over has a gun.” As I headed toward the mountains, all I could think about was Philando Castile, the young African-American man who had a permit to carry and was shot to death in his car in front of his girlfriend and her young daughter by a Minnesota policeman after notifying the officer that he had a weapon. All I could think about was how things might have been different if the situation was reversed and that young black state trooper with braces had been behind the wheel, a white trooper cautiously approaching the car. It was impossible not to think that if I were black, I’d be too scared to carry a gun. It was impossible not to recognize how gun culture reeks of privilege. Last summer I drove back to Charlotte to visit my father for his birthday. While I was there, I went into a Cabela’s store in Fort Mill, S.C., to buy him a new depth finder for his fishing boat. After I found what I was looking for, I headed across the store to see if there were any good deals on ammo. There were floor displays of AR-15s, and probably a hundred or more other rifles and shotguns for anyone to walk up and hold. I watched a kid about 8 or 9 pick up one of those ARs and shoulder it to the center of his chest. He held the gun awkwardly, cocked his head hard to the side, squeezed one eye closed to aim and dry-fired the weapon. I watched two men, presumably his father and grandfather, smile and laugh, then break out their cellphones to snap a few pictures. I remembered how when I was his age, I used to love going to the sporting-goods section of Walmart to look at fishing lures and camouflage clothes. I’d walk over near the register and push the manual turntable on the curio display to look at all the rifles and shotguns. There were usually a few big game guns — a gray stock Remington 783 in .30-06, maybe a Marlin 336 lever action — a couple of pump shotguns, a single shot .410 or 20-gauge. There were always Ruger 10/22s and Marlin Model 60s, the .22LRs kids unwrapped when their grandfathers gave them their first rifles for a birthday or Christmas. There were always guns, but nothing like the assault weapons that line the shelves today. Maybe it’s how I was raised and the types of firearms my family kept, but the idea of owning a rifle designed for engaging human targets out to 600 meters just never interested me. I keep a Savage 10 in .308 to hunt whitetail and hogs. I have a CZ 920 that’s absolute hell on a dove field. I have a handful of .22 rifles that I use for plinking at the range and hunting squirrels and rabbits each winter. Then there are the weapons I keep for defense — the shotgun by the bed, the pistols — firearms whose sole purpose would be to take human life if I were left with no other choice. I’ve witnessed how quickly a moment can turn to a matter of life and death. I live in a region where 911 calls might not bring blue lights for an hour. Whether it’s preparation or paranoia, I plan for worst-case scenarios and trust no one but myself for my survival. My friends see no difference between the guns I own and their ARs. One or two of them rationalize assault weapons the same way I justify what sits by my bed. When I ask if those rifles are really the best option for home defense, they joke about the minute hand of the doomsday clock inching closer to midnight. They post Instagram photos of Sig Sauer MCXs and tac vests loaded with extra magazines, their bug-out bags by the door as they wait for the end of the world.  But a majority defend their ARs the same way I defend the guns I use for plinking and hunting. They say they own them because they’re fun at the range and affordable to shoot. They use the rifles for punching paper, a few for shooting coyotes. Every weekend they fire hundreds of rounds from custom rifles they’ve spent thousands of dollars building. They add bump stocks and Echo Triggers to increase rates of fire and step as close to Title II of the federal Gun Control Act as legally possible without the red tape and paperwork. They fire bullets into Tannerite targets that blow pumpkins into the sky. None of them see a connection between the weapons they own and the shootings at Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Aurora, Orlando, Las Vegas, Parkland. They see mug shots of James Holmes, Omar Mateen, Stephen Paddock, Nikolas Cruz — “crazier than a shithouse rat,” they say. “If it hadn’t been that rifle, he’d have done it with something else.” They fear that what starts as an assault-weapons ban will snowball into an attack on everything in the safe. I don’t believe that politicians are going to ban ordinary guns or overturn the Second Amendment, but I understand their reasoning because I understand what’s at stake. I think about that boy picking up that AR in Cabela’s, and I’m torn between the culture I grew up with and how that culture has devolved. There are changes I know must come, changes to what types of firearms line the shelves and to the background checks and ownership requirements needed to carry one out the door. And there is an unrelenting fear of what could be lost — a subsistence culture already threatened by the loss of public land, rising costs and a widening rural-urban divide; the right of individuals to protect their own lives and the lives of their families. A few days after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., in February, I sat down with a buddy over coffee at the firehouse where he works. The news was on in the background. I told him I’d be fine with an assault-weapons ban. He cut a look in my direction as if I’d absolutely lost my mind. I asked him why anyone needs to own an AR, an AK, an SKS. He said that the question is irrelevant, that the reason doesn’t supersede the right. I could feel my blood pressure rising and my face getting warm. I could see in his eyes that he was equally agitated. Despite everything we have in common, despite the fact that he’s my best friend and we were going squirrel hunting in a few days, the two of us fundamentally disagree. Someone came into the room and changed the subject, and I could sense that he was as thankful as I was. As sad as it is to say, the silence is easier. While the two of us sat there sipping coffee, there were kids on the television in the background, high school survivors who were willing to say what we are not, and I was ashamed. One recent afternoon I rode with my girlfriend, Ashley, an hour east to Asheville. It was the first week of March, but a warm spell had the willows green along the creek in the pasture at our house. It was one of those pretty, late-winter days with bluebird skies when the trees are still naked on the mountains and you can see every shadow and contour of the landscape. Knowing how I hate going to the city, she bribed me with a trip to the Field & Stream sporting-goods store if I would ride along. As we pulled into the parking lot, I thought about the last time we were there, back before Christmas. Ashley didn’t grow up with guns as I did. She’d never owned one before I gave her a shotgun to keep by the bed when I’m away from home. For a year or so, she’d been considering a pistol. She’d held dozens of models but still hadn’t decided on anything. We were at the back of the store looking in the glass case at 1911s. All of a sudden, her eyes got big and she raised her hands then ducked behind me and grabbed onto my arm. I turned and stared down the aisle where a kid who looked about 18 was aiming an AR-15 the salesman had handed him. The muzzle was pointed in our direction. Ashley was terrified. I’ve been at the counter enough to know the predicament — wanting to shoulder a rifle to test the feel but having nowhere sensible to aim. The kid lowered the rifle and went back to talking to the salesman, neither seeming to notice us standing there, Ashley frozen behind me. On the way out, she just kept saying: “He was a kid. He looked like he should’ve been in high school. What does a kid need a rifle like that for? What does anybody need a rifle like that for?” And the truth was, I didn’t have an answer. The truth is, there are guns I feel justified in owning and guns I feel belong on battlefields. I know the reasons my friends give for owning these weapons, and I know that their answers feel inadequate to me. I know that part of what they’re missing or refusing to acknowledge is how fear ushered in this shift in gun culture over the past two decades. Fear is the factor no one wants to address — fear of criminals, fear of terrorists, fear of the government’s turning tyrannical and, perhaps more than anything else, fear of one another. There’s no simple solution like pulling fear off the shelf. It’s an intangible thing. I recognize this, because I recognize my own and I recognize that despite all I know and believe I can’t seem to overcome it. I’m sure that part of why I carry is having a pistol put to my head when I was 14. I’m sure that part of it is having hidden behind walls while shots were fired. Maybe it’s a combination of those two things coupled with headlines and hysteria, the growing presence of mass shootings in American culture. I don’t like being in places where I can’t find the exits. I don’t like crowds and being surrounded by more people than I can keep my eyes on. For the most part nowadays, I stay at the house. When I have to leave, I slide my holster into my waistband before I put on my boots. When a book tour sends me out of North Carolina, 36 states honor the concealed-carry license in my wallet. Unlike a lot of those who carry, I don’t buy into that only-way-to-stop-a-bad-guy-with-a-gun-is-a-good-guy-with-a-gun bravado. I have no visions of being a hero. Instead, I find myself looking for where I’d run, asking myself what I would get behind. The gun is the last resort. It’s the final option when all else is exhausted.  When Ashley and I left the store, we headed toward the Levi’s outlet, where she planned to buy a new pair of jeans. The walkway narrowed, and the sidewalks were filled with people and noise. Even though I knew the risk was remote, my mind raced with all those questions of what I’d do if someone suddenly opened fire. As we walked, I could feel the pistol holstered on my side, the weight of my gun tugging at my belt. The fear was lessened by knowing that there was a round chambered, that all it would take is the downward push of a safety and the short pull of a trigger for that bullet to breathe. I felt safer knowing that gun was there. David Joy is an author who lives in the mountains of North Carolina. His third novel, ‘‘The Line That Held Us,’’ will be published by G.P.

Washington,100," By NOAH WEILANDMARCH 24, 2018 WASHINGTON — Sprinkled amid the throngs of young people protesting gun violence in Washington on Saturday were groups of students without signs denouncing President Trump, or the National Rifle Association, or the shooting massacres that have plagued the nation. Instead, they carried megaphones and wore T-shirts calling attention to something close and constant: urban gun violence. In cities such as Baltimore, the anguish of shootings feels different — the bloodshed comes not in isolated bursts of mass slaughter, but instead in a ceaseless rhythm, something that happens to friends and family, classmates and neighbors, in front yards and on playgrounds. “In the inner city, there’s a game: gunshots or firecrackers?” said Steve Sias, a high school student at Baltimore City College who came to the Washington march. “Whenever you hear the sound, you ask everyone in the house: Is it gunshots or firecrackers? Usually the parents say firecrackers so they don’t startle the kids. But more times than not it’s actually gunshots in the distance, or right outside your window.”  Last year, Baltimore set a per capita record for homicides: 343 total, or about 56 for every 100,000 people. The city’s population is just over 600,000. Its murder rate was by far the highest among the nation’s 30 largest cities.  Students from Baltimore, as well as young people who attended a rally in Chicago, were vocal on Saturday about the need for steps to reduce gun violence, much in the same way as students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 people last month. But they had a different idea of the problem. Destini Philpot, another student at Baltimore City College, was joined on Saturday in Washington by Carrie Zaremba, a student at the Friends School of Baltimore, a predominantly white Quaker institution. The two said they had helped organize a citywide walkout this month that involved both public and private schools. “It shouldn’t take a mass shooting in a predominantly white area like Parkland to start caring about gun violence,” Ms. Zaremba said. Ms. Philpot said that many of those at the rally were thinking of gun violence in the only way they knew how: as mass shootings. Ke’Shon Newman’s brother was shot nine times on Chicago’s South Side, where gun violence is a daily threat. Now, Ke’Shon is heading to Washington to march with high school students from Parkland, Fla. “When they talk about gun violence, they’re talking about schools,” she said. Private donors paid for 60 buses that carried around 3,000 Baltimore students to the Washington event. Some Baltimore organizers skipped their city’s satellite march to attend the one in the capital, hoping to reach an audience largely unfamiliar with the kind of violence that visits them with gruesome regularity. One of those organizers, Erricka Bridgeford, has helped work on a campaign called Baltimore Ceasefire, which holds quarterly “cease-fire” weekends that call for a stop to killings for a three-day period. On Saturday, she recalled what had brought her to Washington: the lasting agony from losing her brother, stepson and friends to gun violence.  “I’ve seen dead bodies and blood,” she said. “These are things you never recover from. You learn how to live your life differently, because the air looks different once you experience that kind of trauma. I have to do something with the pain. I don’t want to be a prisoner to it.” Ms. Bridgeford said shootings were a never-ending feature of life in her Baltimore neighborhood. “There’s no such thing as post-traumatic stress in a lot of communities in America, because there’s no ‘post,’” she said. “You don’t get a chance to experience the aftermath before there’s another trauma because of gun violence.” One of the students walking with Ms. Bridgeford was Shanika Walker, who attends the Excel Academy at Francis M. Wood High School in Baltimore, which recently lost seven students to homicide in 15 months.      “Only the scared people have guns, and they kill people they’re scared of,” she said. “There’s a lot of fear.” On Chicago’s Near West Side on Saturday, just a few miles from neighborhoods where shootings are common, thousands filled Union Park to protest a problem just as local. Many came to the rally bearing personal stories of tragedy and loss, years of frustration with unchanged gun laws and hope replenished by recent student-led activism. 
                Crowds gathered in cities across the United States and around the world.             “We have been fighting for a long, long time,” said Maria Pike, whose son, Ricky, 24, was shot to death in 2012. “And their voice is a fresh voice, is a true voice, is a transparent voice. And it comes from the heart.” Speaker after speaker at the Chicago rally mentioned relatives or classmates who had been wounded or killed in shootings, frustrated that past calls to action had not led to change. “Chicago has been plagued with gun violence way before the Parkland shooting,” said Juan Reyes, a high school student. “Suddenly, people are talking about students not feeling safe in schools. But in reality, students in our city’s South and West Sides have never felt safe.”  One high school student, Denzel Russell, told the crowd, “I have watched one of my friends get murdered while we were playing on the basketball court. That experience had me frozen and speechless.” Mr. Russell added: “We can come together for a march. But are we willing to come together to take action?” Emerson Toomey, 17, who helped organize the Chicago march, said her mother was grazed by a bullet in a drive-by shooting on the North Side of the city. “It’s more about the journey to school for some kids than it is about the actual day at school,” she said. But for the teachers who believe they must now think as much about school shootings as they do about urban gun violence, Saturday’s rallies in Washington and Chicago felt like the meeting of two threats, now inseparable. “I see the look on the students’ faces,” said Jeremy McConnell, a special education teacher at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Baltimore. “They come from these communities. They come from these families that engage in this kind of violence. They might be a sibling or neighbor removed.” “They know gun violence is real. They see it in the streets,” added Mr. McConnell, who, as the voice behind public address announcements at the school, reminds students to be vigilant after news of shootings in Baltimore and across the country. “But they haven’t seen it in school. They think any day now it’s coming here.” Mitch Smith contributed reporting from Chicago.  ",2018-03-25,0.05647166,Sunday
Opinion,101," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Jason Sokol Days after a horrifying act of violence, a Democrat from Connecticut stood on the Senate floor and declared, “I hope that this brutal, senseless killing will shock the Congress into backing me in this fight to take the guns from the hands of assassins and murderers.” The senator was not Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who has become Capitol Hill’s leading voice for gun safety legislation. And the act of violence was not the kind of mass shooting that haunts our nation in the 21st century. It was 50 years ago, after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., that one of Senator Murphy’s predecessors, Thomas Dodd, issued this stirring plea. King was murdered in Memphis on April 4, 1968. That killing, together with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy two months later, spurred the passage of the Gun Control Act that year. It was the first time since the 1930s that the federal government had passed a major gun control bill. We are now witnessing the emergence of the most passionate movement for gun control since 1968. The country’s ordeal half a century ago illustrates that horrific episodes of gun violence do not themselves prompt legislative action; only the sustained pressure of an energized populace can do that. The students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., surely grasp this truth. Those who organized for gun control in 1968 ultimately obtained a piece of legislation that President Lyndon Johnson admitted was “not nearly enough.” The question remains whether the eloquent and indefatigable Stoneman Douglas students, and their millions of allies across the country who will take to the streets in protest this weekend, can push legislators further. After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, advocates of gun control tried to bring legislation to the Senate floor. Dodd often led the charge. At first, he worked with the arms manufacturers in Connecticut and the National Rifle Association. But the N.R.A. grew more extreme over the course of the decade and began to oppose almost all regulatory legislation. Dodd’s bills never made it out of Senate committees. By 1967, opinion polls found widespread support for gun control, even among gun owners. One of the prime reasons was racism: Whites feared black people with guns, whether they were Black Panthers or urban rioters. In the spring of 1967, the California Legislature passed the Mulford Act, which outlawed the open display of guns and was aimed at restraining the Black Panther Party. But such legislative action had become increasingly rare. On April 4, 1968, one hour before James Earl Ray aimed his rifle at the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, the Senate Judiciary Committee deadlocked on a proposal to regulate gun sales (it banned mail-order and interstate gun sales, though it exempted rifles and shotguns). Four senators had been absent from the meeting. At another meeting of the committee two days later, they tipped the balance in favor of this amendment, which had been offered by Dodd. The measure was added to the Safe Streets Act, which was itself part of an omnibus crime bill. The N.R.A. mobilized against the Dodd amendment; on April 9, the association sent a letter to its 900,000 members, warning that the legislation could eventually end “the private ownership of all guns.” Nevertheless, the Senate approved the omnibus crime bill in May, with the gun control amendment attached. Two months to the day after King was assassinated, Senator Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles. His murder further galvanized the American public behind gun control. “The only practical solution is a total ban on firearms for all but law enforcement officers,” wrote one man, Alexander Markovich of Ardsley, N.Y., in a letter to The Times. A group of citizens soon formed the first major organization dedicated to gun control: the National Council for a Responsible Firearms Policy. The Senate majority leader, Mike Mansfield of Montana, had doubts that Kennedy’s assassination would prompt any further gun regulations. Then came the deluge of mail. In the week after Kennedy’s death, Senator Harrison Williams, Democrat of New Jersey, received 6,000 letters advocating stronger gun laws — the most mail that he received on any matter in such a short period of time during his first nine years in the Senate. The mail for Senator Alan Bible, Democrat of Nevada, had previously opposed gun control by about nine to one; after Kennedy’s death, his mail ran three to one in favor of gun regulations. By June 12, Mansfield had changed his mind and said that a measure imposing tighter gun restrictions could most likely pass the Senate. Retailers also felt the pressure of the public. In May, Sears had already ended mail-order sales of firearms. After Kennedy’s death, several other leading merchants followed suit. Some announced they would no longer carry guns or ammunition at all. On June 24, President Johnson delivered an address on guns. He noted that the United States stood “alone among the modern nations of the world” in its lax gun laws. Johnson called for the federal registration of all firearms as well as licensing of every gun owner. Senator Warren Magnuson of Washington, a Democrat, had blocked one of Dodd’s gun control bills in 1964. Now in June 1968, Magnuson told the Senate he was prepared to accept these provisions on gun registration and licensing. But even the conversion of influential senators like Magnuson, and the groundswell of public support, couldn’t protect the bill from the N.R.A. The group’s supporters in the Senate, including Strom Thurmond of South Carolina (who had recently switched to the Republican Party), didn’t have the strength to kill the bill, but they defeated proposals pertaining to gun registration and licensing. The final legislation, the Gun Control Act, banned interstate and mail-order sales of all firearms and ammunition; it also prohibited gun sales to felons, drug addicts and minors. In addition, it required dealers to keep records on those to whom they sold ammunition. Johnson signed the bill on Oct. 22, 1968. But it was an uneven victory for gun control advocates. A federal committee on violence, appointed by Johnson after Robert Kennedy’s death, noted that the Gun Control Act failed on the two most important scores: It neither curbed secondhand gun sales nor decreased the nation’s overall arsenal of firearms. Opinion polls continued to show that broad swaths of the public favored stricter gun regulations. But few were moved to keep the pressure on Congress for a national firearms registry or a licensure law. The urban riots of the 1960s also sparked an increase in gun sales and ultimately helped organizations like the N.R.A., which in the 1970s set out to erode the gun control advances of the previous decade. Its head, Woodson Scott, called for a repeal of the Gun Control Act, and in 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed the Firearm Owners’ Protection Act, which weakened many parts of the Gun Control Act. The story of 1960s gun control legislation, then, is a cautionary tale. It shows that broad-based, sustained public support, combined with the heightened awareness that comes after high-profile tragedies like the King assassination and the Parkland massacre, can indeed force legislators to act. But it also shows how bursts of action are not enough, especially in the face of entrenched opposition. For the gun control advocates who will march on Saturday, the story offers hope. But it is also a reminder that marching is only the beginning.

National,102," By THE NEW YORK TIMESAPRIL 20, 2018 Thousands of students across the United States walked out of their classrooms and into the nation’s schoolyards and streets on Friday in a renewed, coordinated protest against gun violence. The demonstrations, from the statehouse in Texas to a Chicago park, coincided with the 19th anniversary of the mass shooting at Colorado’s Columbine High School — a rampage that stirs students still, even though it happened before most of today’s high school students were born. Friday’s walkout was the third nationally organized student protest in the two months since 17 people were shot and killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Students walked out of classes in March and held rallies across the country later in the month. They say that elected officials have not done enough to prevent school shootings despite a yearslong national debate and the grim roll call of campus killings since Columbine. Shortly before the walkout on Friday began, at 10 a.m., another Florida high school was the site of a shooting when a 19-year-old man entered Forest High School in Ocala and shot a 17-year-old student before being apprehended by an officer stationed at the school. The victim was expected to survive.  “Society has changed since I was a kid, since I was in school,” said Sheriff Billy Woods of Marion County, whose office responded to the shooting. “And this is not just a law enforcement problem. This is a society problem.”  Here are what students had to say as they protested across the country: Brianna Lee, 17, junior at Walter Payton College Prep, Chicago Brianna Lee was 5 when she had her first terrifying brush with gun violence. Her family was returning from church one Sunday in the South Shore neighborhood of Chicago, the same enclave of bungalows and brick apartment buildings by Lake Michigan where Michelle Obama grew up. “Someone was shooting and they hit our car,” Brianna said. “I remember the police officer checking to see if we were O.K. Someone was hit, and he died.” “I could have lost my life in that moment,” she added. Her family has since moved to a safer neighborhood. Brianna, whose straight A’s in seventh grade helped her earn admission to Payton, one of the top-ranked public schools in Chicago, left school on Friday with hundreds of others, saying she believed elected officials were not doing enough to curb violence on the streets and in schools. Threading their way through downtown Chicago, the students walked a mile and a half to Grant Park, chanting, waving signs and attracting supportive applause from bystanders. “We’re meeting up with students from other schools around the city,” she said. “We hope this will make a stronger statement. We deserve to live without fear of violence.” Gracie Shirley, 17, a senior at Highland High School in Salt Lake City Gracie Shirley picked up a firearm for the very first time in late January on a date at a Salt Lake City area gun range. One of the guns was an AR-15. Two weeks later, at Stoneman Douglas, a former student armed with an AR-15 killed 17 people, 14 of them students. “So that just made me feel guilty inside,” Gracie said. “It made me feel dirty. I shot that same gun that boy had used in Florida.” After Parkland, she began lobbying Utah lawmakers for a “red flag” gun law, which would allow the police to temporarily take away guns from people deemed by a judge to be dangerous. Gracie ticked off a list of other changes she’d like to see, including raising the minimum age for firearms purchases to 21 and setting limits on the amount of ammunition in magazines. Gracie helped organize Friday’s walkout at her school, which drew about 150 students to a Salt Lake City park where they wrote letters to lawmakers and made posters for a Capitol Hill rally.  “We are the school shooting generation,” she said. “We’ve never lived in a time when there hasn’t been mass shootings and so I think we’re done. We’re over it.” Gracie will turn 18 in June, and said she couldn’t wait to vote in the midterms. Marusya Airumian, 14, eighth grader at Takoma Park Middle School, Silver Spring, Md. For Marusya Airumian, it was hardly a walkout: Her mother, Susie Baker, had called her school to excuse her before the day began. “I didn’t want to show up and then disrupt school,” Marusya said. “This isn’t between us and our school — it’s between us and our government.” Marusya, clutching a poster that read “I should be writing an essay, not my will,” joined more than 100 others students in front of the White House, crouched together in silent protest under a bare oak tree just beginning to bloom. “We all have lives ahead of us. When I’m in a lockdown drill, I’m not learning my subjects — I’m learning how to literally survive,” she said. “Children shouldn’t have to die because people in the government are lazy.” Marusya, who attended the March for Our Lives in Washington with her mother last month, said she believed that gun ownership should require stricter background checks.  She also opposes arming teachers, including those trained to operate firearms. “That’s not the solution,” she said. “I would feel even more unsafe, and it would cost a lot of money that should be spent on school supplies.” As the students sat quietly, Girl Scout troops and bands of children on field trips marched past the White House, snapping selfies and laughing, punctuating the silence of the protesters. “We’re still here,” Marusya said. “We’re still waiting for change.” Juan Soto, 14, freshman at Linda Marquez High School in Huntington Park, Ca. By the time Juan Soto got to school Friday morning — a few minutes after the first bell — his principal had locked the doors in anticipation of the walkout. No one inside was allowed to leave, and no one was allowed to enter. So Juan and several classmates gathered outside the school’s entrance and started walking with fewer people than they had hoped — about 20 total. Their trek from Huntington Park to the Los Angeles Unified School District headquarters in downtown Los Angeles took three hours, Juan said. He was holding a sign that said “No more silence / End the violence.” “All the gun violence that’s going on, I believe it needs to stop,” Juan said. “Students should not be afraid of going to school, or being bullied. They should go to learn, and be safe.” Juan was among well over a hundred students from Los Angeles high schools who had gathered on a lawn across the street from the headquarters. “I think my mom thinks I should be in school right now,” he said, adding that his principal had just notified her of his truancy. “I’m going to tell her the truth, that I came to protest. Show her videos, that we’re actually here.”  Madeline Miller, 16, junior at Chamblee High School, Chamblee, Ga. Before the protest really began on Friday, Madeline Miller had settled on her story: Instead of being in her junior year classes at her high school near Atlanta, she was visiting Georgia State University. She was close to the campus — but she was actually demonstrating outside the Georgia State Capitol. “My parents are completely O.K. with it,” Madeline, 16, said with a smile. “In America, we have the right to be out here and to protest and to show what we want. This has all been a really big culmination of what we’ve been wanting.” Standing outside the Republican-controlled Capitol, where lawmakers have resisted gun control measures for years, she said she had first learned about the Columbine massacre as a child. Then, in second grade, there was a shooting across the street from her elementary school. She remembers the sound of gunfire. “I think right now, there’s so much that’s been building up inside of us,” she said. “I remember the moment when my mom said that there was a shooting at Sandy Hook. I just started crying in the car. I’ve been so hurt by this — and all of us have — and we weren’t even there when it happened.” She added, “Just knowing that people like me have the voice and the power to change this for our kids and for the generation, we’re taking this moment and we’re going to use it.” Reporting was contributed by Alan Blinder from Atlanta, Emily Baumgaertner from Washington, Julie Bosman from Chicago, Niraj Chokshi from New York, Jennifer Dobner from Salt Lake City and Louis Keene from Los Angeles.

Metro,103," By SARAH MASLIN NIRAPRIL 20, 2018 Most of them were not yet born when students shot a dozen people to death inside Columbine High School in Colorado, an atrocity that sparked a national debate over guns exactly 19 years ago. But on Friday, on the anniversary of the April 20, 1999, shooting, the several thousand high school students who walked out of schools across the city and beyond to rally against guns in Manhattan said they felt they lived in a world of near-constant Columbines. The teenagers spoke angrily of active shooter drills since kindergarten, of backpack and locker searches, of mock lockdowns sitting in silence in classrooms with the lights turned out, as they gathered in protest in Washington Square Park. And they spoke of the numbing barrage of school shootings in America — by some counts more than 200 in the past two decades. [See photos of Friday’s student walkouts in cities across the United States.] Caroline Castellano, 16, a sophomore at Hunter College High School in Manhattan, had only just recently heard the name Columbine. “So I did the classic internet search,” she said. “It really freaked me out really quickly.” Near her, with a pink Post-it note with the word “victim” written on it on her forehead, stood Kathya Rodriguez, 16, a sophomore at the High School of Fashion Industries, a public school in Chelsea.  Earlier this year, Kathya said, there was a scare at her school when a student brought in a weapon. (According to a New York City Department of Education spokeswoman, the weapon was an air gun, which police confiscated.) The situation made her realize her vulnerability, Kathya said. Why, she asked, didn’t Columbine “have a bigger impact on society?” Many of the students said the February shooting that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., was their tipping point.  Friday’s protest, billed as the National School Walkout, was in New York City organized in part by Arielle Geismar, 16, a junior at Beacon High School, who said students from about 35 schools from the city and from New Jersey and Connecticut participated. More than 2,600 schools in every state joined in nationwide, according to the walkout’s website. On Friday afternoon, Arielle stood beside the park’s arched monument to George Washington, addressing the crowd. “We have been practicing school lockdowns since kindergarten,” she shouted. “If we are old enough to be affected by gun violence, then you’re damn well sure we are old enough to have an opinion about it!” She spoke of the killing of Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old black man who was shot to death by police in Sacramento last month, and the slaughter of 58 people by a gunman at a concert in Las Vegas in October, as part of the same continuum, taking head-on a criticism of the nascent teenage movement that, in focusing on mass attacks, it ignores the police shootings and gun crime that disproportionately target black people. “We will not stop until 58 people can walk into a concert, 49 people can walk into a club, 20 first graders can walk into their classroom, 17 students can walk into their school, 12 people can walk into a movie theater, one black man can walk into his grandmother’s backyard,” she said, “and all of them can walk out.” Locations for the demonstrations nationally ranged from a park in Chicago to the statehouse in Texas; it was the third nationally coordinated student protest  in the months since the Parkland shooting. The day’s protest was conceived by Lane Murdock, a sophomore at Ridgefield High School in Ridgefield, Conn. After Parkland, Lane started a Change.org petition that spread far beyond her town, which is less than half an hour from Sandy Hook, where in 2012, 20 elementary school students and six faculty members were shot and killed.  “It’s kind of surreal,” Lane said on Friday, as she and hundreds of her classmates walked out onto the school’s football field. On the field with them was Jennifer DeJulio, a history and social studies teacher. “You teach these kids about ways people have worked to change our country. And now, watching them working to make change is amazing,” she said.      “I’ll be teaching this ten years from now,” Ms. DeJulio added. In New York City, some schools like the private Packer Collegiate Institute had agreed to let students who had parental consent attend the protest. Fifth graders on up, accompanied by chaperones, filed out of the school in Brooklyn Heights en route to the protest on Friday morning. But other students arrived at the protest without permission slips, under threat of demerit, and fearful of academic repercussions. The New York City Department of Education said that it would consider leaving school to attend the protest an unexcused absence. For some students, there would be consequences. The crowd of students in Washington Square Park covered just about a quarter of the park, thinned perhaps by the education department’s threat, or by simple protest fatigue. That did not stop Lorna Gregory, 15, a student at Pace University High School, from joining in on Friday. “This is considered cutting. I think I failed dance. I had a 97, and now I’ll have a 40 or something,” she said, standing on a bench in the park to see over the crowd of students. “It’s kind of worrying me a little bit, but I’m standing for a cause.” (She may not need to worry: “We would not take account of school discipline in a circumstance of peaceful protest on a pressing matter of conscience and national debate,” said a spokesman for New York University, John H. Beckman. At Columbia University, any students “who face disciplinary action for peaceful protest will not be at a disadvantage in the Columbia admissions process,” according to Victoria Benítez, a spokeswoman for the school.) On the C train on Friday, Zeny Gatdula was with a group of classmates she had drawn from the Professional Performing Arts School, their banners in their laps. “In humanities class we are taught about history, these great people who stood up for what they believed in, even when everybody was against them. And I think that’s the key in getting people to rise up,” she said. She was 17 years old, she said, but in a month, she would be able to register to vote, a moment she was looking forward to, when she could become more than just a protesting voice. It was a sentiment shared widely across the protests, where in Manhattan and Ridgefield, teenagers filtered through the crowds with voter registration forms. In Connecticut, the students’ goals were overt: On a fence by the football field was a sign that read, “Can’t hear us now? How about in 200 days?”  In 200 days it would be Nov. 6, the date of the midterm elections.

Meadow Pollack would never” — and suddenly stood silent. We thought the loudspeakers had broken. The silence continued. Scattered groups started chanting slogans to fill the void, and faded into uncertain silence. She had begun her speech saying, “Long, tearful chaotic hours in the scorching afternoon sun were spent not knowing.” When she concluded we realized the uncertainty, the tension, the anxiety she created with her unexpected silence had conveyed what the children at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had lived through, but their uncertainty was not about a speech or loudspeakers — it was about their lives. Emma González delivered the Gettysburg Address for our times. It is for us the living to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us. PHILIP M. HOCKERALEXANDRIA, VA. To the Editor: I have the most tremendous admiration for the way students organized and carried out the anti-gun protests Saturday and would like to make one suggestion: In the months leading up to the midterm elections, publicize over and over again lists of how elected lawmakers stand on this issue. Voters must know how their district, state and national representatives have voted and will vote. Cast your vote in the midterms with the same sense of purpose and power shown in the protests. Do not lose your momentum. The National Rifle Association makes large donations to gain backing from elected officials, but in the end it is you young voters with your “passion and fury” who can defeat them. ALICE SALIGMAN, NEW YORK To the Editor: Your otherwise excellent article ignores the victories already scored by the students. While it is true that the new budget bill “took no significant new steps on gun control,” it is not true that its only concessions were “some school safety measures and modest improvements to the background check system.” The bill also authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on the causes of gun violence. Ending the ban on C.D.C. research is a significant step forward in understanding the problem more clearly so we can create more effective solutions. The students also had an astonishing victory when Florida, which has been a laboratory for N.R.A.-backed laws like Stand Your Ground, passed its first gun safety law in years. Grass-roots advocacy campaigns are marathon efforts that rarely see instant results. But these students have already scored impressive wins. Failing to acknowledge those wins undermines their hard work and risks contributing to a demoralizing sense of cynicism. ELISE NAKHNIKIAN, NEW YORK To the Editor: Re “Rallies for 2nd Amendment Try to Have a Say, Too” (news article, March 25): I disagree with your characterization of the counterprotesters at Saturday’s March for Our Lives as “supporters of the Second Amendment.” People who oppose reasonable restrictions on gun ownership are not defending the Second Amendment; they are demanding an absolutist interpretation. No other right guaranteed by our Constitution comes without limits. Those of us who support firearm regulations are acting within the true spirit and the meaning of the Second Amendment. JOYCE DENN, WOODBURY, MINN. To the Editor: Even at 72 I can still be awed, mesmerized and more hopeful than ever before. Emotionally spent after watching hours of young people marching for their lives and for the lives of everyone, I realized that hope is ours because of them. The children will lead us? Yes, they did. It is their movement, their moment, their future. They’ve shown us how to come together, to be inclusive and to fight for change. I couldn’t be prouder of the bright, savvy young people around us.

I cheer you, our children, as you shame us into addressing the increasing gun violence that is taking your lives. Stay strong. In 1980 one mother got MADD. She could make sense of the death of her child only by fighting to stop drunken driving. In a few years it became unacceptable to drive drunk. Your voices will make a difference. Students from one school, then from one state and on Wednesday from across the country stood up and demanded action.

They are refusing to be silenced or to allow their peers to die in vain. They are making their cause sacred and for the good of all. And they are rightly expecting us, their elders, to listen and respond.

It’s a shame, however, that some of the demonstrations had to be carried out “in defiance of school authorities,” as you report. If they were really educators, school administrators would have encouraged (or led) their students in this protest, not opposed it. It would have been the right thing to do, not only because their cause was just, but also because this national crisis provided a teachable moment to show young people how important it is for citizens of a democracy to exercise their right to peaceful assembly.

Express,106," By MATTHEW HAAGAPRIL 13, 2018 After the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 people in February, President Trump vowed to train and arm teachers to secure schools and stop future massacres. Many teachers and their unions fiercely rejected the president’s suggestion, but one Stoneman Douglas educator, Sean Simpson, said he would consider it. “There are some of us that are willing to take the training if it was offered and probably be another line of defense,” Mr. Simpson, a chemistry teacher, told MSNBC a week after the shooting at the school, in Parkland, Fla. He cautioned, however, “I’m not sure if it’s the answer.” This past weekend’s events may provide a clue. Mr. Simpson was charged on Sunday with failing to safely store a weapon after he accidentally left his Glock 9 millimeter handgun at a beach restroom, the Broward County Sheriff’s Office said.  By the time Mr. Simpson realized it was missing and returned to the restroom, at the Deerfield Beach Pier, a homeless man who was drunk had picked it up and fired a bullet into a wall. Mr. Simpson, 43, grabbed the gun from the man. The deputies who responded to the scene arrested the teacher, and he was booked into the county jail on a second-degree misdemeanor charge, which can carry a maximum 60-day jail sentence. Mr. Simpson, who was released after posting $250 bond, did not respond to an email seeking comment. In an interview about the episode, Mr. Simpson told Local 10, the ABC station in Miami, that he did not believe he had violated Broward County Public Schools policy. A schools spokeswoman said on Friday that the district had not yet decided whether to take any action against Mr. Simpson. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     While Mr. Trump’s call for arming schoolteachers has gained little momentum across the country, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida recently signed gun control measures that included a controversial provision: $67 million to create a school “marshal” program. The program would allow districts to arm and train some school employees, including librarians and counselors, but not full-time classroom teachers. School officials and students in Broward County did not want the program, which was named after Aaron Feis, a coach who died in the massacre. This week, school board members there voted not to participate and encouraged the state to redirect the $67 million to pay for additional school resource officers. Some critics of the president’s plan have pointed to recent cases that they say highlight the dangers of arming teachers. Last month, a teacher in Seaside, Calif., accidentally fired a handgun at school when he was showing it to students during an advanced public safety class. Three students suffered minor injuries, and the teacher resigned this week.  Two weeks after the Parkland shooting, a Georgia high school teacher was arrested after he barricaded himself in his classroom and fired through a window, the authorities said. A student was injured when she tried to run away.  ",2018-04-13,0.05457441,Friday
Opinion,107," Supported by Letters To the Editor: Re “Trump Retreats From Promises on Gun Control” (front page, March 13): In the days after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, a month ago, President Trump announced to the world that if he had been there, he probably would have bravely run into the school without a gun to try to stop the killing. It was reality TV at its finest. But when it came to be brave in the real world, Mr. Trump turned and ran from the National Rifle Association like the coward he is, backing down from his previous proclamations that he would raise the minimum age of buying assault guns and other stricter gun proposals favored by most of the country. Big talk, no action, no backbone from Mr. Trump. RICHARD FINNGOLDENS BRIDGE, N.Y. To the Editor: In saying that the proposal to raise the age limit on purchases of assault weapons had “not much political support (to put it mildly),” President Trump fails a key test of presidential leadership. In his seminal work “Presidential Power,” Richard Neustadt concluded that the power of the president is the “power to persuade.” Significant public support exists for improvements in gun safety. Rather than mobilizing the public, the president retreats. In the aftermath of the massacre at Sandy Hook, I worked with courageous members of Delaware’s General Assembly to pass key pieces of gun safety legislation, including closing the gun show loophole. The margin of victory in these votes was surprisingly small given the public support. The support of former Attorney General Beau Biden and Lt. Gov. Matt Denn demonstrated what leaders can accomplish even in the face of legislative resistance. If only President Trump were to follow their lead. JACK MARKELL, WILMINGTON, DEL. The writer was governor of Delaware from 2009 to 2017. To the Editor: The N.R.A. says, “Jump!” President Trump doesn’t even pause to ask, “How high?” He just leaps with all his might.

Express,108," By MAGGIE ASTORMARCH 8, 2018 Just three weeks after the Parkland school shooting, Gov. Rick Scott has signed into law Florida’s most aggressive gun reform in recent years. The gun control bill that the Florida Legislature passed on Wednesday was, in many respects, a major victory for the new activists of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It was passed in defiance of the National Rifle Association and, if Gov. Rick Scott signs it, will be the first successful gun control measure in Florida in more than 20 years. But it left out many of the biggest provisions the students and their supporters had sought, including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Here is a look at what is in the final bill, and what is not. • Raise the minimum age. The bill would change the minimum age for all gun purchases to 21 from 18 — a provision that would have prohibited the Parkland gunman, Nikolas Cruz, 19, from legally buying the rifle he used in his massacre. This is a divergence from federal law, under which people cannot buy handguns from licensed dealers until they are 21, but can buy shotguns and rifles — often much deadlier than handguns — at 18. (Unlicensed sales, such as at gun shows, have looser restrictions.) Governor Scott and Senator Marco Rubio, a fellow Republican, endorsed the age increase last month. • Create a waiting period. Prospective gun buyers would have to wait three days, or until a background check is completed, whichever is longer. There would be some exceptions, including for police officers, members of the military, licensed hunters and licensed concealed carriers.  • Ban bump stocks. Bump stocks are devices that can be attached to rifles to enable them to fire faster, and they will no longer be legal in Florida if the bill is signed. (You can learn more about them here.) They came to public attention in October, after a gunman in Las Vegas used them to kill 58 people and wound hundreds; with the devices, his semiautomatic weapons were able to fire almost as fast as fully automatic machine guns. After that massacre, the N.R.A. said it supported a national ban on bump stocks, an extremely rare gun control endorsement by the group. But the proposal languished in Congress, and while President Trump told the Justice Department last month to issue new regulations, thus far it has not. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     • Arm school employees. Perhaps the most controversial provision of the bill is one that would allow superintendents and sheriffs to arm school personnel — a measure not requested by the Parkland students but long desired by the N.R.A., which argues that gun-free zones prevent people from defending themselves in an attack. Specifically, the bill would create a $67 million “marshal” program under which certain employees — including counselors, coaches and librarians, but not full-time classroom teachers — could be trained and armed. (The program would be voluntary.) Under an amendment successfully proposed by State Senator Randolph Bracy, a Democrat, these employees would first have to undergo 12 hours of diversity training.  • Fund school security. The bill allocates millions of dollars to make buildings more secure and to hire more school-based police officers. However, when the Parkland shooting happened, an armed school resource officer was present, standing by the door to the building, and did not enter. (The officer, Scot Peterson, resigned from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office after his actions were called into question; Sheriff Scott Israel said at a news conference last month that he should have gone into the building and confronted the gunman. Mr. Peterson later said he acted the way he did because he thought the gunfire was coming from outside.) • Expand mental health services and regulations. Florida school districts would receive state funding to provide mental health care to students. Additionally, the bill would allow the police to temporarily confiscate guns from anyone subject to involuntary psychiatric evaluation under Florida’s Baker Act. It would also prohibit gun sales to Floridians who were committed to mental institutions or deemed mentally incompetent by a judge, and would allow the police — with judicial approval — to bar a person deemed dangerous from owning guns for up to a year. • Ban assault weapons. One of the biggest demands of the Parkland students — as well as many lawmakers, including some Republicans generally sympathetic to the N.R.A. — was a ban on assault weapons. The term is ambiguous and would have needed to be defined in any such legislation; a federal ban that was in place from 1994 to 2004 applied to semiautomatic weapons with two or more of a list of specific features (for example, a telescoping stock and a pistol grip). The wounds caused by these weapons can be far more devastating than a handgun injury, and in polls, majorities support banning them. • Suspend AR-15 sales. Once it became clear that a majority of the Florida Legislature was not inclined to ban all assault weapons, Senator Oscar Braynon, a Democrat, proposed an amendment to the gun control bill that would have halted AR-15 sales for two years. The AR-15 and its variants have become the weapons of choice for many mass shooters, including Mr. Cruz as well as the gunmen in Sutherland Springs, Tex.; Las Vegas; Orlando, Fla.; San Bernardino, Calif.; Newtown, Conn.; and Aurora, Colo. With such a weapon, an attacker can wield essentially the same firepower as American soldiers. Mr. Braynon’s amendment was rejected. • Ban high-capacity magazines. The bill does not ban high-capacity magazines, which can hold as many as 100 rounds. These magazines allow gunmen to shoot more people in less time, because they do not have to stop to reload as often. (In addition to the obvious — forcing a pause in the gunfire — reloading can afford a brief opportunity to take the gunman down. The 2011 shooting in Tucson, Ariz., which killed six people and gravely wounded Representative Gabrielle Giffords, ended when the gunman stopped to reload and onlookers grabbed the new magazine from his hands and tackled him.) Like a ban on assault weapons, this is a proposal with widespread public support. • Strengthen background checks. Changes to background check procedures have received bipartisan support since the Parkland shooting, including from President Trump, but the Florida bill does not address them. Federal law requires background checks for gun sales by licensed dealers, but there are holes in the system. Private firearm sales are not always subject to checks, for example. And officials do not always inform the F.B.I.’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System of things, like criminal convictions and mental illnesses, that could disqualify a person from buying a gun. The Sutherland Springs shooter, for example, had been court-martialed for domestic violence, but the Air Force did not submit that information to the federal database; nor did it report similar information about dozens of other people.

Opinion,109,"Opinion CreditLauren Simkin Berke Supported by By The Editorial Board Adults are supposed to take care of children — not only keep them safe, but make them feel safe. Schools are essentially an extension of the home, in that sense, providing sanctuaries of learning, of nurturing and care. But after years of attacks by people with weapons of war, students cannot feel safe and are demanding that adults end years of complaisance and act. They are not asking for their schools to become armed garrisons. Rather, they want those weapons to be brought under control. And unlike too many adults, the young people leading Wednesday’s walkout at schools around the country — inspired by angry, motivated students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed by a former student with an assault weapon — have had the courage to take on the industry responsible for blocking every reasonable measure to limit access to guns, including those that make it all too easy to commit mass murder. As Stoneman Douglas junior Florence Yared said in front of the Florida State Capitol late last month, “You adults have failed us by not creating a safer place for your children to go to school. So we, the next generation, will not fail our own kids. We will make this change happen. If not today, then tomorrow, and if not tomorrow, next year. Take it from us. You created a mess for us, but we will make this world safer for our children.” With Wednesday’s demonstration, and their March for Our Lives movement on March 24 in Washington, young voices are being heard. How will the nation’s adults respond? Hopefully, by amplifying their demand: Never again. — Alfonso Calderón, Junior —Aly Sheehy, Senior — Emma González, Senior —Jaclyn Corin, Junior —Jose Iglesias, Senior —Madison Leal, Junior —Nikhita Nookala, Senior —Alex Wind, Junior —Leonor Munoz, Senior —David Hogg, Senior —Adam Alhanti, Junior —Morgan Williams, Junior —Sarah Chadwick, Junior —Lina Crisostomo, Junior —Liz Stout, Senior Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

National,110," By JACK HEALYFEB. 20, 2018 The AR-15 rifle has become known as the powerful weapon used by a number of gunmen to slaughter scores of people in Newtown, San Bernardino, Las Vegas, Parkland and beyond. But to Alexander Garcia, the AR-15 represents something else altogether: his favorite gun. “That’s my baby,” said Mr. Garcia, 34, a musician in Southern California who likes to take his AR-15 out target-shooting. “It’s one of the greatest rifles I’ve ever fired. I’m a very proud owner.” The waves of fury and grief over the mass shooting that killed 17 students and educators last week at a South Florida high school has refocused attention onto the AR-15 and its popularity. In the wake of the shooting, a handful of AR-15 owners are rethinking whether they still want to own a style of rifle originally designed for troops to kill enemy fighters. The gun fires a small-caliber, high-velocity bullet that can cause especially damaging soft-tissue wounds.  One gun owner in upstate New York sawed his AR-15 into three pieces in an online video that quickly went viral, asking, “Is the right to own this weapon more important than someone’s life?” In Broward County, Fla., another man asked the local sheriff’s office to destroy his AR-57 semiautomatic rifle.  But in interviews, other AR-15 owners said they swear by the guns. They called the rifle a lightweight, easy-to-fire symbol of their Second Amendment rights, and said they would never give up what they called a misunderstood weapon.

Here are the perspectives from some of those AR-15 owners. Mr. Garcia said he bought his AR-15 about a year ago, and keeps it locked in a case inside his home in Rancho Cucamonga, in San Bernardino County, Calif. He said that he had a concealed-weapons permit, and that he went out with a handgun at all times. “As we speak, I am armed,” he said. He takes his AR-15 target-shooting, and like many other owners, said he liked to swap out the rifle’s components and after-market additions. At the shooting range, he said other gun owners often approached him and asked about how he had personalized the rifle to his liking. Mr. Garcia, whose father served in the military, said he embraced the military roots of the AR-15. The Pentagon’s version of the rifle, renamed the M16 and capable of automatic or burst fire, was first distributed to American troops in Vietnam, and versions of the gun that do not fire automatically became enormously popular for civilian use. AR-15s were targeted under the Assault Weapons Ban from 1994 to 2004, but today are legal. Mr. Garcia said that his was made by Smith & Wesson, and that he had bought it for about $800. Mr. Garcia said the weapon had been demonized and misrepresented. “This rifle is in no way an assault rifle,” he said. “An inanimate object is not committing these crimes.”      Shyanne Roberts was nine years old when she built her first AR-15-style rifle. Now 13 and a competitive shooter in South Carolina, she regularly uses AR-15s at shooting competitions, along with shotguns and pistols. Her rifle is black with purple marbling. Her name is engraved on the scope mount, so everyone knows it is hers. “I like shooting them because it’s just another gun to master,” she said. She has testified against stricter gun laws in New Jersey, and said that she did not support tightening laws on semiautomatic rifles in the wake of the Florida shooting. “Everybody always says it’s the gun that did it,” she said. “No, it’s the person. The person uses the firearm the incorrect way. No matter what, they’re still going to get their guns.”  Shyanne’s father, Dan Roberts, said that being vocal AR-15 owners (they have eight between them) had made them targets for online anger. He said he had gotten messages hoping that a gun would blow up in Shyanne’s face, or that she would become a victim in the next mass shooting. “We’re not monsters,” Mr. Roberts said. “We’re just regular, normal people who want to be left alone.” For Jerrol Jensen, the growing body count has complicated his feelings about the AR-15 rifles that sit in a locked cabinet at his home in Lincoln, Neb. Mr. Jensen, 55, who calls his politics “extremely liberal,” said he had used AR-15-style rifles for three decades to hunt and target-shoot. He said he had done extensive work as a test-shooter for rifles, some of which were used by the military and law enforcement. He said he always felt he was doing a public service, and enjoyed being outside to hunt deer and the relaxation of target-shooting. But he said that he opposed the National Rifle Association’s aggressive opposition to gun-control measures, and that he supported closing loopholes that allow guns to be purchased outside licensed dealers. His wife does not like the AR-15s that are in their home, and supports banning them outright, Mr. Jensen said. He wondered what place there should be in society for a weapon that had caused so much carnage. “That’s the potential of the rifle,” Mr. Jensen said. “There’s nothing out there that’ll compare to it as to doing what it was designed to do, and that’s kill people.” A version of this article appears in print on February 21, 2018, on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘I’m a Very Proud Owner.’ Fans of AR-15 Explain  Their Weapon’s Appeal.

National,111," By JACK HEALYFEB. 20, 2018 The AR-15 rifle has become known as the powerful weapon used by a number of gunmen to slaughter scores of people in Newtown, San Bernardino, Las Vegas, Parkland and beyond. But to Alexander Garcia, the AR-15 represents something else altogether: his favorite gun. “That’s my baby,” said Mr. Garcia, 34, a musician in Southern California who likes to take his AR-15 out target-shooting. “It’s one of the greatest rifles I’ve ever fired. I’m a very proud owner.” The waves of fury and grief over the mass shooting that killed 17 students and educators last week at a South Florida high school has refocused attention onto the AR-15 and its popularity. In the wake of the shooting, a handful of AR-15 owners are rethinking whether they still want to own a style of rifle originally designed for troops to kill enemy fighters. The gun fires a small-caliber, high-velocity bullet that can cause especially damaging soft-tissue wounds.  One gun owner in upstate New York sawed his AR-15 into three pieces in an online video that quickly went viral, asking, “Is the right to own this weapon more important than someone’s life?” In Broward County, Fla., another man asked the local sheriff’s office to destroy his AR-57 semiautomatic rifle.  But in interviews, other AR-15 owners said they swear by the guns. They called the rifle a lightweight, easy-to-fire symbol of their Second Amendment rights, and said they would never give up what they called a misunderstood weapon. In fact, one owners group, the AR-15 Gun Owners of America, said it had gained 10,000 new fans on its Facebook page since the shooting in Parkland. Here are the perspectives from some of those AR-15 owners.

National,112," Supported by By Richard A. Oppel Jr. In the wake of Florida’s latest shooting massacre, and calls to tighten its relaxed gun laws, Gov. Rick Scott declared that now, everything was on the table. Yet the governor sidestepped whether he would explicitly support new gun restrictions. And he emphasized he would never “trample” on anyone’s constitutional rights. In Florida — where a troubled teenager used a legally purchased military-style semiautomatic rifle to kill 17 people at a high school this past week — extraordinary political obstacles would have to be overcome before any real changes in gun laws could occur. A strong case can be made that the state has been the most important laboratory for pioneering far-reaching, pro-gun regulatory blueprints later adopted throughout the nation, profoundly changing how guns are regulated across the United States. And Florida’s gun lobby continues to instill fear in lawmakers. It is led by Marion Hammer, 78, who grew up shooting rabbits, reportedly packs a pistol in her purse and seeks political vengeance on legislators who disappoint her. Though Florida is a purple state, Mr. Scott, a favorite of gun lobbyists, and other Republicans control state government, and they have steadfastly opposed new restrictions. For gun-control advocates, victories of late have included steps like defeating legislation to allow some people to carry guns into airport terminals. Gun owners are now a major constituency, too: Nearly two million residents have permits to carry concealed weapons, far more than any other state. Florida, however, cannot be called the place with the most permissive gun regulations. Some states, for example, do not require permits to carry concealed weapons. While Florida gets an “F” rating, the lowest, from one major gun-control group, the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, 24 other states also share that ranking. The state’s more significant pro-gun legacy has been spearheading two influential changes in gun regulations that became models for many other states: Laws that essentially require the authorities to issue permits for carrying concealed guns to residents who pass a simple protocol. And “Stand Your Ground” laws that give protections to people who use deadly force in public if they argue that they felt they were in imminent danger. Critics call them “shoot first” laws and say they encourage escalations in violence and make it harder to punish some wrongdoers. Most states now have Stand Your Ground laws as well as permissive rules allowing the carrying of concealed weapons. Florida’s pro-gun approach came under scrutiny after mass shootings in Orlando in 2016 and in Fort Lauderdale last year. But, little changed in the Statehouse; bills to limit assault weapons, for example, did not get a hearing. Even after the massacre in Parkland last week, the only movement on gun bills dealt with proposals to expand where guns could be carried, not to restrict them. State Senator Dennis Baxley, a Republican who wrote the Stand Your Ground law in 2005 and is a major gun-rights backer, doubts gun-control proposals will gain traction. “I don’t see any interest here on that,” said Mr. Baxley, who represents parts of Sumter, Marion and Lake Counties. “We’re pretty comfortable that freedom works.” Mr. Baxley likens gun restrictions to imposing limits on forks and spoons to reduce obesity. He argued the focus needs to be on school safety. Just after the Parkland shooting, a move to try to advance another of Mr. Baxley’s bills — allowing officials to permit certain adults to carry guns at schools if they pass a screening — prompted anger from critics. Mr. Baxley said the bill would deter shootings, but critics called it the latest effort to chip away at prohibitions on guns in schools. In any case, Mr. Baxley said lawmakers later decided to take the proposal off this week’s agenda. “I don’t think we’re ready for that discussion yet,” he said. More to the point for gun-control advocates is whether fury over the Parkland massacre might make a difference among Republican legislators who did not tighten gun laws after the killing of 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando two years ago. “They didn’t do anything after Pulse, but these are 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds getting slaughtered,” said State Senator Linda Stewart, a Democrat who represents part of Orange County. Ms. Stewart said her legislation banning assault weapons after the Orlando massacre had not even been assigned to a committee. “This is going to be harder to ignore,” she said. At the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday, hundreds of people gathered for a rally promoting gun reform in what one official called the “gunshine state.” The day’s speakers shouted into a microphone until their voices were hoarse and children barely out of diapers gripped giant signs. “Enough is enough,” read one. Changing Florida’s gun laws could come down to two things: Whether Ms. Hammer can keep legislators from breaking ranks. And, the ambitions of Mr. Scott, who is increasingly expected to challenge Bill Nelson, the state’s incumbent Democratic senator this year. Ms. Hammer, who stands barely 5 feet tall, has been the state’s chief gun lobbyist for decades and was the first woman to serve as national N.R.A. president. The state’s Stand Your Ground and concealed-carry laws were largely her initiatives. Legislators, especially Republicans, fear her ability to marshal angry emails from thousands of gun owners in every pocket of the state, destroying ambitions of even onetime allies. “She can be pretty hard on people who aren’t coming around,” Mr. Baxley said. “She has a long memory when you cross her.” Many point to Charles McBurney, a former Republican state representative and N.R.A. ally, who two years ago sided with prosecutors and blocked one of Ms. Hammer’s favored bills. Facing term limits, Mr. McBurney was considered a very strong choice for a gubernatorial appointment to a judgeship in Jacksonville, his hometown. But Mr. Scott passed him over after Ms. Hammer began a ferocious email campaign demanding he not be selected. A spokeswoman for Mr. Scott denied that the gun lobby influenced the decision. Mr. Baxley isn’t so sure. He said the governor had to be thinking, “Why would I cross all these N.R.A. members?” Mr. McBurney declined to comment. Ms. Hammer did not respond to a request for comment sent through the N.R.A.’s national office. Another wild card, conceivably, is Mr. Scott, who Ms. Hammer once praised for having signed more pro-gun bills in one term than any Florida governor in history. After the Orlando massacre — where the killer also used a military-style semiautomatic rifle — the governor said that “the Second Amendment didn’t kill anybody.” But after CNN’s Wolf Blitzer repeatedly pressed him last week about what he would do to prevent another massacre, Mr. Scott said, “Everything’s on the table, all right? I’m going to look at every way that we can make sure our kids are safe.” Some suggested this revealed a new openness for regulation, now that he may face a hard-fought campaign against Mr. Nelson. Asked for clarification on whether the governor might back new gun restrictions, his spokeswoman said she hoped to have more information this week, after he meets with other leaders to discuss “ways to keep Florida students safe, including school safety improvements and keeping guns away from individuals struggling with mental illness.” Some critics call the focus on mental health a subterfuge. Federal law already bars people who have been adjudicated mentally ill or committed to institutions from buying firearms. Despite their rhetoric, state Republican leaders have not proposed expanding mental-health restrictions inside Florida, critics say. It also deflects attention from other issues, like making sure powerful assault weapons and hundreds of rounds of high-velocity ammunition cannot be bought in short order by teenagers, said Patricia Brigham, a chair of the Florida Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence. “It’s the typical bait-and-switch argument,” she said.

Express,113," By JEFFERY C. MAYSMARCH 31, 2018 The Fox News host Laura Ingraham announced on Friday that she was taking a week off following the decision of several companies to pull advertising from her show after she ridiculed a student survivor of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting. “I’ll be off next week for Easter break with my kids. But fear not, we’ve got a great lineup of guest hosts to fill in for me,” Ms. Ingraham said on her show, “The Ingraham Angle.” In response to an email, Fox News said that Ms. Ingraham’s break was a “preplanned vacation with her kids.” The dispute began on Wednesday, when Ms. Ingraham shared an article about how the student, David Hogg, 17, had been rejected from several colleges, and she accused him of whining about it.  In response, Mr. Hogg, who has called for stricter gun regulations after the Feb. 14 shooting, called on advertisers to boycott Ms. Ingraham’s show.  He posted the names of her top advertisers on Twitter and urged his nearly 700,000 followers to call those companies. Several companies, including Hulu, Nutrish, Nestlé and TripAdvisor, have yanked their advertisements from Ms. Ingraham’s show. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     “We’d like to confirm that we are no longer advertising on Laura Ingraham’s show and are monitoring all of our ad placements carefully,” Hulu said  on Twitter. “The decision of an adult to personally criticize a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our values,” Wayfair, an online retailer of home goods, said in a statement. The company said it supported “open dialogue and debate.” Consumers have increasingly used social media to demand that advertisers respond to controversies, particularly those involving Fox News hosts. Last year, more than 50 brands pulled ads from “The O’Reilly Factor” after The New York Times reported on settlements that the show’s host, Bill O’Reilly, had made with women who accused him of sexual harassment or other inappropriate behavior, which contributed to his ouster. On Thursday, Ms. Ingraham apologized to Mr. Hogg, saying he should be proud of his grade point average. “On reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week, I apologize for any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland,” Ms. Ingraham wrote on Twitter. But Mr. Hogg said Ms. Ingraham’s apology did not go far enough and seemed designed only to stop more advertisers from dropping her show.  “I will only accept your apology only if you denounce the way your network has treated my friends and I in this fight,” Mr. Hogg said on Twitter. “It’s time to love thy neighbor, not mudsling at children.” Follow Jeffery C.

Opinion,114," Supported by By Bret Stephens Had Wednesday’s massacre of 17 people at a Florida high school been different in one respect — that is, had alleged perpetrator Nikolas Cruz shouted “Allahu akbar” during the course of his rampage — conservatives would be demanding another round of get-tough measures. Tougher immigration laws. Tougher domestic surveillance. A rollback of Miranda rights for the accused. Possibly even a Muslim registry. Constitutional protections and American ideals, goes the argument, must sometimes yield to urgent public safety concerns. But Cruz, like Las Vegas’s Stephen Paddock or Newtown’s Adam Lanza and so many other mass murderers before them, is just another killer without a cause. Collectively, their carnages account for some 1,800 deaths and close to 7,000 injuries in the United States since the beginning of 2013, according to The Guardian — though that’s only a small fraction of overall gun-related deaths. And conservatives have next to nothing of use to say about it. Well, almost nothing. Some conservatives talk about the importance of mental-health interventions with the potentially violent. Florida Gov. Rick Scott wants to keep firearms out of the hands of the mentally ill. The Obama administration tried to do that after the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre by requiring the Social Security Administration to submit the names of severely unwell persons to the F.B.I. Congressional Republicans and President Trump reversed the rule a year ago. Representative Salud Carbajal, a California Democrat, introduced a “red flag” bill last May that would make it easier for family members to keep firearms out of the hands of potentially dangerous relatives. The bill has 50 Democratic co-sponsors but not one Republican. Maybe the Parkland massacre will shame the majority into embracing the legislation. But such laws can achieve only so much. Keeping track of dangerously unstable people who shouldn’t own guns but do is hard: Devin Kelley, the Texas church shooter, had once escaped from a mental health hospital and was legally barred from buying the weapon he used to murder 26 people in November. Nor can the federal government be in the business of getting unwell people to take their meds. That way lies the path to a Clockwork Orange. Beyond that, the conservative answer is: more guns. It’s true that a gun in the right hands at the right time and place can save lives, as the former National Rifle Association instructor Stephen Willeford proved when he shot Kelley as the latter emerged from the church. No sensible society should want to keep arms out of hands like his. But that’s an argument for greater discrimination in terms of who should get to own a gun, not less. The United States has, by far, more guns in more hands than any other country in the developed world. It has, by far, the highest incidence of firearm-related homicides and suicides. Correlation is not causation, but since Americans aren’t dramatically crazier than other nationalities, what other explanation is there? Gun advocates often make the claim that the mere presence of firearms deters crime. But research from Stanford’s John Donohue suggests that “right to carry” state laws have led to a 13 to 15 percent jump in violent crime. New York City, with the most aggressive enforcement of gun laws of any major U.S. city, has seen its homicide rate drop to levels not experienced since the 1950s. By contrast, in the permissive gun state of Missouri, St. Louis has the highest per capita murder rate of any major American city. Nor is it remotely true, as gun advocates contend, that gun bans necessarily result in increased murder rates. The homicide rates in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have all fallen since enacting strict national gun control. Conservatives are supposed to be empiricists, not idealists. They should learn the lesson of experience. So all this is an argument for tougher gun-control laws, right? Well, not exactly. In October, after the Las Vegas massacre, I made the case in this column for repealing the Second Amendment. The column is still being criticized by conservatives for reasons that usually miss the point. We need to repeal the Second Amendment because most gun-control legislation is ineffective when most Americans have a guaranteed constitutional right to purchase deadly weaponry in nearly unlimited quantities. There’s a good case to be made for owning a handgun for self-defense, or a rifle for hunting. There is no remotely sane case for being allowed to purchase, as Paddock did, 33 firearms in the space of a year. But that change can’t happen without a constitutional fix. Anything less does little more than treat the symptoms of the disease. I know what the objections to this argument will be. What about John Locke and Cesare Beccaria? What about the preservation of American liberties and the encroachments of bureaucratic liberal despotism? Right. What about another 17 murdered souls, and their classmates and families, and the inability of today’s conservatives to offer anything except false bromides and empty prayers?

Opinion,118," Supported by Letters To the Editor: I am a resident of Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were tragically killed last week. Over the weekend, President Trump came to Florida. He visited a hospital in a community that is 10 minutes from us. I hope that Mr. Trump enjoyed his golf game this weekend. I spent the weekend weeping. I also spent it infuriated that our president didn’t have the guts or the empathy to visit our town. But he would have had to pay a price for the visit: hearing our anger at the loss of our beautiful children. Our community is broken. Our community is angry that people can legally buy assault rifles. How many more children have to die? AUDREY GAJUS, PARKLAND, FLA. To the Editor: Re “Don’t Let 17 Deaths Be in Vain,” by Christine Yared, a freshman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (Op-Ed, Feb. 19): How sad it is that a 15-year-old girl, Ms. Yared, should be more mature, eloquent and sensible than the majority of our members of Congress. I am an old white guy who has always been in favor of stricter gun laws. But I didn’t do much beyond voting for candidates who support such legislation. I obviously didn’t do enough. Let’s hope that Ms. Yared’s heart-rending essay will resonate not only with her friends who are eligible to vote but also with 18- and 19-year-olds everywhere in our country. DAVID ZINKIN, PRINCETON, N.J. To the Editor: To the grieving students of Parkland, Fla., and all those who have come before you: My generation has failed you. But you will not fail. You are present and future voters, future elected officeholders, and you will make a difference. Respond to every politician and media commentator with whom you disagree, vote out of office every representative and senator who has failed you, and allow us — your parents and grandparents — to embrace you, to love you and to stand with you. Demand the safety and protection you deserve. Settle for nothing less. ALLEGRA SENSENIGCOTO DE CAZA, CALIF. To the Editor:  A new slogan, “Marching Is Fine, Voting Is Better,” needs to be circulated among the high school students who are expressing frustration in response to the massacre in Parkland, Fla. Most of these young people will be eligible to vote in the next local and national elections. We need to convince them that the best action possible is to confront candidates who favor retaining access to assault weapons and campaign to remove them or prevent them from attaining elected office. We need our young people now more than ever. STEPHANIE MILLER, BALTIMORE To the Editor: I still have my draft card, which I showed my sons when we talked about how the threat of dying in an ill-advised war (like Vietnam) was a critical motivator to bring about change when I was a young man. The threat of dying in a school shooting is now motivating today’s high school students (tomorrow’s voters), who realize that they are being asked to sacrifice their lives so that gun manufacturers can maintain their profits. To see them finding their voice is to witness the wonder that is America. ANDREW GUNTHEROAKLAND, CALIF. To the Editor: Re “Congress Fails to Curb Guns. Could Banks?,” by Andrew Ross Sorkin (DealBook column, Feb. 20): I suspect that the profit motive would get in the way of such a plan, but what about a national teachers’ strike, both at the elementary and secondary level? Teachers are already overworked, underpaid, over-regulated and now seriously in harm’s way. What have they got to lose? With the children out of school, their parents might just be motivated to write their congressional representatives. We need the teachers as well as the students in this fight.

Business,119," By NIRAJ CHOKSHIMARCH 22, 2018 YouTube said this week that it would tighten restrictions on some firearm videos, its latest policy announcement since coming under scrutiny after last month’s mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. The video-streaming service, which is owned by Google, said it would ban videos that promote either the construction or sale of firearms and their accessories. The new policy, developed with expert advice over the last four months, will go into effect next month, it said. “While we’ve long prohibited the sale of firearms, we recently notified creators of updates we will be making around content promoting the sale or manufacture of firearms and their accessories, specifically, items like ammunition, gatling triggers, and drop-in auto sears,” YouTube said in a statement. YouTube, which described the move as part of “regular changes” to policy, notified users in a Monday forum post. The company had previously banned videos showing how to make firearms discharge faster, a technique used by the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas last fall.  The announcement comes days before planned student-led protests against gun violence on Saturday. It was met with frustration from gun rights advocates.  “Much like Facebook, YouTube now acts as a virtual public square,” the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a private group representing gun makers, said in a statement. “The exercise of what amounts to censorship, then, can legitimately be viewed as the stifling of commercial free speech, which has constitutional protection. Such actions also impinge on the Second Amendment.”      The policy shift comes as YouTube and other technology platforms face increased scrutiny after the Parkland shooting, in which 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Days after that massacre, a video promoting a baseless conspiracy about a shooting survivor became the top-trending video on YouTube, prompting a crackdown on such videos. YouTube’s chief executive also said that the platform planned to fight misinformation by working in partnership with Wikipedia, the nonprofit user-run online encyclopedia. But Wikipedia said it  knew nothing about that plan. Other businesses have also made changes amid growing pressure following the Parkland attack. Dick’s Sporting Goods, Walmart and Kroger all raised the age limit for firearm purchases to 21. The retail chains REI and Mountain Equipment Co-op suspended orders of some popular products because the company that owns those brands, Vista Outdoor, also manufactures assault-style rifles. In 2016, Facebook announced a ban on private gun sales on its flagship website as well as on Instagram, the photo-sharing social network it owns. Anti-gun activists have complained that sellers still found ways around Facebook’s ban. A version of this article appears in print on March 23, 2018, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: YouTube to Ban Videos That Promote The Construction or Sale of Firearms.

National,120," By MAGGIE ASTORMARCH 5, 2018 Every few weeks or months, after a man armed with a high-powered weapon walks into a school or a church or a nightclub and opens fire, the national response plays out in a rote, almost performative way. The outcry lasts only a few days before guns fade back into the background noise of American politics. But nearly three weeks after a gunman walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and killed 17 people with an AR-15, the conversation has not faded, because the students of Stoneman Douglas have taken up the cause of gun control. Already, they have lobbied state lawmakers in Tallahassee, spoken with President Trump and persuaded many companies to cut ties with the National Rifle Association. And on Saturday, they met with students fighting gun violence in Chicago. The protests calling for stricter gun control measures come on the heels of other youth movements, but the momentum they have gained makes them stand out. Several of those students, and their critics, have noted the incongruity of teenagers getting involved in politics. But history is full of movements led by students — albeit usually in college, not high school. Some were successful and others brutally crushed, but even the latter still resonate. (Most of these campaigns have been liberal-leaning: Though conservative college students have made their presence known, their actions have rarely coalesced into broader movements.) Here are seven other cases where young people were moved to challenge adult society. The lunch counter sit-ins that would change American history began with four teenagers who walked up to a Woolworth’s lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C., and refused to leave.  Those young men — Ezell Blair Jr., 18; Franklin McCain, 19; Joseph McNeil, 17; and David Richmond, 18, all students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University — made their stand on Feb. 1, 1960. Within three days, they were joined by some 300 others. By summer, the sit-ins had spread to more than 50 cities, and lunch counters were rapidly desegregating.  The actions of the so-called Greensboro Four led directly to the creation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which the civil rights organizer Ella Baker urged students to form in April 1960 to coordinate the continuing sit-ins. Later, SNCC would play a major role in the Freedom Rides and in voter registration efforts across the South. And the momentum that began at the Woolworth’s lunch counter would eventually contribute to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed segregation in public spaces. Perhaps more than anything, the results of the Greensboro sit-ins showed the power of a small group of students prepared to stand alone if necessary. “Inevitably, people ask me, ‘What can I do?’” Mr. McCain said in an interview in 2005. “What kind of question is that? Look around you. Once you identify what you want to do, don’t ask for the masses to help you, because they won’t come.” In the spring of 1968, student protests exploded on multiple continents. Some accomplished their stated goals and others did not, but even the latter contributed to a climate in which change seemed possible and more people were inspired to act. In March, more than 1,000 students at the historically black Howard University took over the administrative building, and many more barricaded themselves in their dormitories. They demanded that the university president resign; that the curriculum emphasize African-American history and culture; that a judiciary system involving students be created; and that disciplinary proceedings against students involved in an earlier protest be dropped. The university agreed to the third and fourth demands. Students at Columbia University used similar tactics a month later, occupying several buildings for a week before 1,000 police officers stormed the campus to evict them. Strikes continued for the rest of the semester, essentially paralyzing the university even after the occupiers were cleared out. The students were protesting two things — the construction of a university gym in Morningside Park in Harlem that would provide only limited access to Harlem residents, and Columbia’s Vietnam-era contract with a weapons research think tank — and Columbia canceled both. On the other side of the Atlantic, students revolted in France and Poland. In Warsaw, protests against government censorship built from 300 students in January to 20,000 in March, but were ultimately suppressed. And in Paris, some 20,000 swarmed the Sorbonne in May, turning cars into barricades and clashing with riot police. French labor unions and teachers joined a 24-hour general strike in support of the students, bringing the nation to a grinding halt but failing to topple President Charles de Gaulle. As with the Greensboro sit-ins 16 years earlier, the uprising started by public school students in Soweto, South Africa, would expand far beyond them. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.      On June 16, 1976, several thousand students near Johannesburg began a peaceful march that turned deadly when the police attacked with guns and tear gas. The protesters were objecting to a law that mandated Afrikaans-language education, but they set in motion a global movement against apartheid. Images of police brutality — particularly a photograph of a high school student carrying the body of Hector Pieterson (12 or 13 years old; accounts differ) — drew international attention to the broader cruelty of South Africa’s government. From the actions of the students of Soweto grew a vast campaign led by college students in the United States, who built shantytowns on campus quads, blockaded buildings and disrupted speeches by South African politicians. From Columbia University to the University of California, protests compelled administrators to withdraw billions of dollars in investments from companies tied to South Africa. Over time, the resulting economic stress contributed, along with other factors, to the dismantling of apartheid. On June 4, 1989, several weeks of student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing ended in slaughter when thousands of Chinese troops began firing on crowds of protesters in Tiananmen Square. Hundreds of people, possibly thousands, were killed; a death toll was never released. Nearly 30 years later, China is still not a democracy. Its trend, on display in 1989, of allowing economic but not political liberalization continues. And in some ways, the protests had the opposite of their intended effect: The crackdown provided a visceral demonstration of how far the government would go to suppress dissent, which discourages some would-be activists to this day. But an iconic image from June 5, of a lone, still unidentified man standing in front of a column of tanks, endures as an emblem of defiance in the face of overwhelming odds. Eight days after the Berlin Wall fell, signaling the beginning of the end of East Germany’s Communist government, the students of neighboring Czechoslovakia stepped in to topple their own. The uprising began with thousands and grew until Prague was flooded with 500,000 protesters, who stayed stubbornly peaceful even as riot officers attacked, giving the revolution its name. Just 11 days after the protests began, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia relinquished power, paving the way for the playwright Vaclav Havel to become president in December.  It was an extraordinary revolution — “swift, entirely nonviolent, joyful and funny,” said the author Timothy Garten Ash — and one of the most rapid and complete successes for a student-led movement in modern history. After a series of scuffles between college students and the police in July 1999, officers raided a dormitory at the University of Tehran, wounding at least 20 people and jailing 125. If their goal was to stop the unrest, the police could not have gone more astray: In response, more than 10,000 Iranian students took to the streets. In the short term, the protests forced officials, including President Mohammad Khatami and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to condemn the police raid. The ayatollah urged restraint even if students “set my picture on fire or tear it,” a remarkable directive from a government not normally tolerant of political dissent. But perhaps more important were the long-term consequences. Since Iran’s 1979 revolution, student activists had generally been tied to political parties. After the 1999 protests, that ceased to be the case. And while Iran’s society and politics remain tightly regulated, the tradition of student activism has continued there, more so than in many countries with similar political systems. The Black Lives Matter movement began with three women in their late 20s and early 30s: Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi. But when it exploded into national view in 2014 after the police killing of Michael Brown, 18, many of the protesters who filled the streets of Ferguson, Mo., were students. Like the students of Parkland, they were protesting gun violence — but by the police, often involving unarmed black suspects, in shootings captured on video. Unlike the students of Parkland, they were not lauded in the prevailing public narrative, a discrepancy that some Black Lives Matter activists have noted in recent weeks. Instead, they were frequently labeled troublemakers and thugs. But even as questionable police shootings happen, convictions of officers remain rare, and protests on the streets continue, Black Lives Matter has had a fundamental impact on the national conversation about racial bias and the use of excessive force by the police.

Business,121," By JACEY FORTINFEB. 24, 2018 Eight days after a gunman with an AR-15 rifle killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., a major bank cut ties with the National Rifle Association. The bank, the First National Bank of Omaha, was among the first businesses of at least a dozen to scrap special rates or discounts to the five million people the N.R.A. says it has as members. Supporters and detractors of the N.R.A. have butted heads over the issue on social media, calling on partner companies to either stay put or step away, essentially leaving them with no neutral ground. Of those companies that did cut ties, many said they did it in response to consumer complaints. In a statement on Feb. 24, the N.R.A. said the companies, “in a shameful display of political and civic cowardice,” were trying to punish its law-abiding members who had nothing to do with the Parkland shooting.  The statement added: “In time, these brands will be replaced by others who recognize that patriotism and determined commitment to Constitutional freedoms are characteristics of a marketplace they very much want to serve.”  Kevin C. Langin, a spokesman for the First National Bank of Omaha, said in a statement on Feb. 22 that customer feedback had prompted a review of its contract with the N.R.A. “As a result, First National Bank of Omaha will not renew its contract with the National Rifle Association to issue the N.R.A. Visa Card,” the statement said. On Feb. 24, Delta Air Lines said on Twitter that it was ending its contract with the association for discounted rates through the airline’s group travel program. “We will be requesting that the NRA remove our information from their website,” the company said. United Airlines tweeted a similar message two hours later. Two moving van companies wrote on Twitter on Feb. 23 that they were severing ties with the N.R.A. Allied Van Lines and North American Van Lines, which share a parent company, Sirva, each said it “no longer has an affiliate relationship with the NRA effective immediately,” and had asked to be removed from its website.      A spokesman for Avis Budget Group, which owns the car-rental companies Avis and Budget, said on Feb. 23 that a discount partnership with the N.R.A. would end by March 26. Hertz said the same day that it was ending its rental car discount program for N.R.A. members. The day before, the car rental companies Alamo, Enterprise and National, which share the parent company Enterprise Holdings, tweeted that they would end their discount for N.R.A. members beginning March 26. Starkey Hearing Technologies, which focuses on hearing health care, education and support, said on Twitter on Feb. 24 that it would not renew its discount program with the N.R.A. The foundation said it would ask the N.R.A. to remove its information from the association’s website. MetLife said in a tweet on Feb. 23 that it was ending a discount program for N.R.A. members. The same day, a spokesman for the insurance company Chubb told Reuters it would no longer have a partnership with the N.R.A. on an insurance program called the “NRA Carry Guard.” The spokesman said Chubb had given notice of this change three months ago. TrueCar, an automobile pricing and information website, said on Feb. 23 that it was “ending its car buying service relationship” with the N.R.A. at the end of the month. The home security company SimpliSafe once offered two months of free monitoring for N.R.A. members but the company said in an email on Feb. 24 that it had “discontinued our existing relationship with the NRA.”  The cybersecurity company Symantec announced on Twitter on Feb. 23 that it had ended a discount program with the N.R.A. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified an organization that said it would not renew its discount with the N.R.A. It is Starkey Hearing Technologies, not Starkey Hearing Foundation.  ",2018-02-24,0.048871167,Saturday
National,122," By THE NEW YORK TIMESMARCH 24, 2018 Witness the thousands who have gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington to protest gun violence, in 360-degree video. Demonstrators flooded streets across the globe in public protests on Saturday, calling for action against gun violence. Hundreds of thousands of marchers turned out, in the most ambitious show of force yet from a student-driven movement that emerged after the recent massacre at a South Florida high school. At the main event in Washington, survivors of mass shootings, including the one in Florida, rallied a whooping crowd — “Welcome to the revolution,” said one of the student organizers — and spoke of communities that are disproportionately affected by gun violence. “It is normal to see flowers honoring the lives of black and brown youth that have lost their lives to a bullet,” Edna Chavez, 17, said of her South Los Angeles neighborhood. • In New York, marchers bundled in bright orange — the official color of a gun control advocacy group — charged toward Central Park. And in Parkland, Fla., less than a mile from where the shooting took place last month, one protester’s eyes brimmed with tears, surrounded by the echoing chant, “Enough is enough!” • Small groups of counterprotesters supporting gun rights also marched in different cities. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators carried pistols and flags. One of their signs read: “What can we do to stop mass shootings? SHOOT BACK.” In Boston, opposing groups of protesters shouted at one another before the police intervened.  • More than 800 protests were planned in every American state, including in some gun-friendly cities, and on every continent except for Antarctica, according to a website set up by organizers. Check out photos from around the world.  • Planning for the events was spearheaded by a group of students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., who have emerged as national anti-gun figures in the wake of the shooting that left 17 dead. • Sharp-tongued and defiant, the student leaders hoped to elevate gun control as a key issue during the upcoming midterm elections, and to inspire their peers to register to vote en masse. • They were building on the success of a national school walkout this month, and gun control legislation in Florida that they helped to usher in. Their goal remains, as articulated online in the event’s mission statement, to “demand that a comprehensive and effective bill be immediately brought before Congress to address these gun issues.” • The White House responded to the demonstrations in a statement. “We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today,” it read. On Friday, the Justice Department proposed banning so-called bump stocks, but President Trump signed a spending bill that included only some background check and school safety measures. • The Times had journalists covering the marches in Washington; New York; Boston; Montpelier, Vt.; Parkland, Fla; Dahlonega, Ga.; Chicago; Salt Lake City; Los Angeles; Seattle; Anchorage, Alaska; Rome; Berlin; and Tokyo. Follow them on Twitter. • Sign up for the Morning Briefing for news and a daily look at what you need to know to begin your day. The student activists emphasized that they would soon have access to the ballot box as they hope to build support for candidates who support universal background checks and bans on assault-style weapons.  Large majorities of Americans say they support gun control measures like universal background checks. Yet when put directly to the people in a referendum in recent years, the results have been mixed. Here is a look at what polling and recent referendums reveal about the political challenges that face the student-led activists. At street intersections in Washington on Saturday, voter registration volunteers waved clipboards over their heads, shouting, “It takes less than three minutes!” They wore neon yellow shirts that read, “Register to vote!” “These Parkland students have already been able to make change that no one else could for decades,” said Carol Williams, a volunteer from West Chester, Pa. In Parkland on Saturday, Sari Kaufman, a Stoneman Douglas sophomore, urged people to “turn this moment into a movement” that would push out of office any politician who took money from the National Rifle Association. “They think we’re all talk and no action,” she said to loud applause and cheers, and urged the crowd to prove politicians wrong by voting in huge numbers. “Remember that policy change is not nearly as difficult as losing a loved one,” she said. “Don’t just go out and vote: Get 17 other people to go out and vote.” The crowd was particularly rousing in its appreciation of Casey Sherman, 17, a Douglas student and one of the Parkland rally organizers. “My love for Parkland had taken on a whole new meaning,” she said. “After all this heartbreak, we have come back stronger than ever. Those 17 people did not die in vain. We will stop at nothing until we make real, lasting change.” At the rally in Washington, the first speaker was Cameron Kasky, 17, a junior at Stoneman Douglas who last month challenged Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican, to stop accepting donations from the National Rifle Association. Mr. Kasky called for universal background checks on gun sales and a ban on assault rifles.  “To the leaders, skeptics and cynics who told us to sit down and stay silent: Wait your turn,” Mr. Kasky said. “Welcome to the revolution.” Another speaker, Edna Chavez, 17, a high school senior in Los Angeles, said she had lost her brother to gun violence. “Ricardo was his name. Can you all say it with me?” she asked. The crowd said his name over and over again, as Ms. Chavez smiled through tears. Alex Wind, 17, a junior at Stoneman Douglas, spoke about the need for legislative change. “To all the politicians out there, if you take money from the N.R.A., you have chosen death,” he said. “If you have not expressed to your constituents a public stance on this issue, you have chosen death. If you do not stand with us by saying we need to pass common sense gun legislation, you have chosen death. And none of the millions of people marching in this country today will stop until they see those against us out of office, because we choose life.” David Hogg, 17, a senior at the high school and one of the most recognizable faces of the movement, said: “Who here is going to vote in the 2018 election? If you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking.” Read more about what the day was like for other Stoneman Doulgas students. On Saturday, officials with Metro, the region’s subway system, said more than 207,000 rides had been taken on the system by 1 p.m., about half of the number by that time during the women’s march. A team of crowd science researchers led by the professor G. Keith Still of Manchester Metropolitan University in England estimated that about 180,000 people attended Saturday’s rally in Washington. They examined photographs, video and satellite imagery of the rally to estimate the crowd density in different areas of the demonstration. The number is less than half of the 470,000 that Mr. Still estimated had attended the women’s march in Washington in 2017.  Ms. González spoke for just under two minutes on Saturday at the rally in Washington, describing the effects of gun violence in emotional detail and reciting the names of classmates who had been killed. 
                Crowds gathered in cities across the United States and around the world.             Then she said nothing for four minutes and 26 seconds. She stared straight ahead during her period of silence onstage, her sometimes watery eyes fixed in the distance. Then a timer went off. “Since the time that I came out here, it has been six minutes and 20 seconds,” she said. “The shooter has ceased shooting, and will soon abandon his rifle, blend in with the students as they escape, and walk free for an hour before arrest. “Fight for your lives, before it’s someone else’s job,” she continued, and then walked offstage. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said early in the afternoon on Twitter that an estimated 150,000 people were marching. “You have to know when a revolution is starting,” he said. The musician Paul McCartney, speaking to CNN at the march, opened his jacket to show a T-shirt that read “We can end gun violence.” “This is what we can do, so I’m here to do it,” Mr. McCartney said. “One of my best friends was killed in gun violence right around here, so it’s important to me,” he added, referring to his Beatles bandmate John Lennon, who was shot and killed in December 1980 outside his apartment on the Upper West Side. As the crowd thickened before a rally in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower near Columbus Circle, Mary Ann Jacobs, 55, of Sandy Hook, Conn., milled in the crowd with her husband.  Ms. Jacobs was a library clerk during the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. She barricaded herself in the school’s library, “in a closet hidden behind file cabinets” along with 18 fourth graders. “In the months after the shooting it took 100 percent of my personal focus to get up and go to work every day to take care of my surviving students,” she said. Tensions over guns seemed to converge in Salt Lake City, where a gun rights march kicked off just minutes before a gun control march. The gun rights rally drew hundreds of people, many carrying signs — “AR-15s EMPOWER the people,” one said. Brandon McKee was one of the many people with pistols on their hips. His daughter Kendall, 11, held a sign: “Criminals love gun control.” Mr. McKee said of the Washington marchers: “I believe it’s their goal to unarm America, and that’s why we’re here today. We’re not going to stand idly by and let them tell us what we can and cannot do.” As the gun rights advocates set off toward the Capitol, some began to heckle a gun control advocate, Linda Peer, 67, who had infiltrated the march line. “She’s not a true American!” one man yelled. “Shame on you!” the group chanted at her. In Boston, a clutch of Second Amendment supporters gathered in front of the Statehouse with signs that said, “Come and take it.”  “We believe in the Second Amendment,” said Paul Allen, 62, a retired construction worker who lives in Salisbury, Mass. “You people will interpret it the way you want and we’ll interpret it for what it is — that law-abiding citizens who are true patriots have the right to bear arms.” Mr. Allen described supporters of gun control as “ignorant sheep who are being spoon-fed by liberal teachers.” “They haven’t read the Constitution and they don’t know what it means,” he said. Read more about these protests. Gun rights organizations were mostly quiet about the demonstrations on Saturday. A spokesman for the N.R.A. did not answer several emails requesting comment. On the eve of the march, Colion Noir, a host on NRATV, an online video channel produced by the gun group, lashed out at the Parkland students, saying that “no one would know your names” if someone with a weapon had stopped the gunman at their school. “These kids ought to be marching against their own hypocritical belief structures,” he said in the video, adding, “The only reason we’ve ever heard of them is because the guns didn’t come soon enough.” What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     In places where gun control is less popular, demonstrators pooled together, trying to show that support for their cause extends beyond large, predominantly liberal cities. In Vermont, a rural state with a rich hunting culture and some of the nation’s weakest gun laws, marchers gathered at the Capitol in Montpelier. Organizers hoped that thousands would turn out by the end of the day — an ambitious goal in a city of 7,500 people.  “I hope the national march is going to be impactful, but at least we know state by state that we can make change,” said Madison Knoop, a college freshman who organized the rally. In Dahlonega, Ga., several hundred people gathered outside a museum, a surprising show of strength for gun control in an overwhelmingly conservative region. “We’re going to be the generation that takes down the gun lobby,” Marisa Pyle, 20, said through a megaphone. Ms. Pyle, a student at the University of Georgia and an organizer of Saturday’s rally in Lumpkin County, challenged critics of the demonstrations across the country. “I’m starting to think they just want to shut us up because they’re scared of what we have to say,” Ms. Pyle said. Young people were scattered in a crowd dominated by people in middle age and older. There were few signs of counterprotesters. But as Ms. Pyle led a roll call of the Stoneman Douglas victims, a man in a passing vehicle yelled: “Trump! Trump! Trump!” In Anchorage, the largest city in Alaska, marchers gathered in weather that peaked above freezing around noon. Alaska has not seen a school shooting in two decades, but it has the highest rates of both gun-related deaths and suicides in the nation.  High schoolers turned out in jean jackets and hoodies, and shoveled snow to clear paths for one another in the 24-degree weather. “Do you know how it feels to have the principal pretend over the intercom that the shooter is walking your way?” Elsa Hoppenworth, a 16-year-old junior at West Anchorage High School, asked a cheering crowd. “Those who do not contribute to change contribute to our death.” Melanie Anderson, a 44-year-old middle school teacher, held up a sign that said “teacher, not sharp shooter.” Keenly aware that Alaska is a pro-gun state, the students who marched and made speeches were careful to make clear that they were seeking modest reinforcements on existing gun laws, rather than all-out bans. Ke’Shon Newman’s brother was shot nine times on Chicago’s South Side, where gun violence is a daily threat. Now, Ke’Shon is heading to Washington to march with high school students from Parkland, Fla. Thousands of demonstrators came together at Chicago’s Union Park, where speaker after speaker rattled off grim statistics about the city’s endemic violence. “Chicago has been plagued with gun violence way before the Parkland shooting,” said Juan Reyes, a high school student. “Suddenly, people are talking about students not feeling safe in schools. But in reality, students in our city’s South and West Sides have never felt safe.” Speaking at the rally in Washington, Trevon Bosley, a 19-year-old Chicago resident whose older brother Terrell died of a gunshot wound in 2006, said, “We deserve the right to have a life without fear of being gunned down.” Mya Middleton, 16, also traveled to speak in Washington, where she recalled an encounter with an armed man who was stealing from a store when she was a high school freshman.  “He pulls out this silver pistol and points it in my face and said these words that to this day haunt me and give me nightmares. He said, ‘If you say anything, I will find you.’ And yet I’m still saying something today,” she said, to loud cheers. Read more about how students from Chicago and Baltimore, which set a per capita record for homicides in 2017, experienced Saturday’s events. On Saturday in Tokyo, where guns are highly restricted and shootings are rare, dozens of protesters gathered with signs bearing the names of people who have been killed by gun violence. Participants, many of them American, took turns reading poems or sharing memories of family members or friends killed in shootings. “I think it is important not just to call for changes to our gun laws, not just to debate the subtleties of the Second Amendment, but to remember that it is people who have died because of our gun laws,” said Linda Gould, an American in Japan who organized the vigil. And in Nagoya, Japan, Mieko Hattori, the mother of Yoshihiro Hattori, a Japanese exchange student who was shot and killed in Baton Rouge, La., in the early 1990s, said earlier in the week, “I just wanted to convey our message: We support you from Japan.” In Rome on Saturday, demonstrators at the American Embassy chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, the N.R.A. has got to go” and waved signs that read, “A Gun Is Not Fun” and “Am I Next?” The speakers at the rally included local students as well as Valentina and Gabriela Zuniga, a freshman and junior at Stoneman Douglas, who were on spring break. “We knew there were rallies all over the world, and we looked for one in Rome,” said Gabriela, 16, adding that her life had changed drastically since the shooting. “You go into class and see empty desks. It’s different for everyone now.” Near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, 150 to 200 people, most of them Americans, held signs saying “bullets aren’t school supplies” and “Waffeln statt Waffen” (Waffles Instead of Weapons).  Dylan von Felbert, 16, an 11th grader at the John F. Kennedy School in Berlin, said, “Our generation can be very apathetic — myself included — so I think it’s important to support those things you really believe in.” In Madrid, a small crowd — almost all of them Americans — braved a cold Saturday to gather in front of the American embassy. An American student read out a list of all the American school shootings since the Columbine massacre. Fiona Maharg Bravo attended with her 13-year-old daughter, Elena. Ms. Maharg Bravo grew up in Chicago but has lived in Madrid for more than 10 years. “It’s perhaps hard for people here to relate to what unfortunately is a uniquely American issue,” she said.

Opinion,123," Supported by David Leonhardt By David Leonhardt and Ian Prasad Philbrick This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. There’s not enough deep but respectful disagreement in political debate today. The recent discussion between Jamie Weinstein and Ta-Nehisi Coates is a welcome exception. Weinstein hosts a podcast for National Review Online. Coates, of course, is the best-selling author and Atlantic writer. In their 70-plus-minute conversation, they discuss racism, the idea of America and Coates’s career. Among the highlights: — Weinstein argues that wealthy black celebrities and black police officers, among other examples, undercut the notion of systemic racism, and Coates has an effective response. — Coates talks about how the #MeToo movement gave him empathy toward white people who feel guilty about racism. — Coates explains why Barack Obama’s paid speeches to Wall Street were a mistake. — Coates (shortly after the one-hour mark) offers a wonderfully succinct description of why so many journalists like their jobs. — An hour and 13 minutes in, Coates praises Kevin Williamson, then of National Review, as one of his favorite conservative writers — one with whom he often disagrees. After the podcast aired, Williamson was hired by The Atlantic, where Coates works, to some controversy. (In The Times, our colleague Michelle Goldberg makes the case against hiring Williamson.) If you enjoy the podcast — and Weinstein’s graciousness and sincerity, as Coates puts it — Weinstein has also interviewed The Times’s David Brooks. E.P.A. shenanigans. This week, the Environmental Protection Agency released scientifically inaccurate talking points on climate change. It’s preparing to roll back green vehicle-emissions rules. And its administrator, Scott Pruitt, recently declared that the agency would no longer use scientific studies that rely on private data to develop environmental policies. In truth, the former E.P.A. officials Gina McCarthy and Janet McCabe argue in The Times, scientists often keep sensitive data that’s critical to their research confidential. Billed by Pruitt as a measure to increase transparency, the move is actually “his latest effort to cripple the agency,” they write. Pruitt’s tenure has also been clouded by scandal, including lavish domestic air travel at taxpayers’ expense. Pruitt’s recent claim that he’s spent less on travel than Obama E.P.A. officials did “is, at best, laughably inadequate. At worst, it’s shockingly dishonest,” explains The New Republic’s Emily Atkin, who did the math. Unable to justify the expenses, she writes, Pruitt and his staff have “tried to distract with falsehoods.” Speaking of falsehoods … This week brought more personal attacks, doctored images and right-wing misinformation aimed at undermining the student activists from Parkland, Fla. “What we’re seeing here is a spreading stain, in which conspiracy mongering” is “peddled to a receptive audience softened up for decades by Fox News,” argues The Washington Post’s Margaret Sullivan.

Opinion,124," Supported by Letters To the Editor: Re “Dick’s Sporting Goods, Major Gun Retailer, Stops Selling Assault-Style Weapons” (nytimes.com, Feb. 28): This article brought me to tears. Finally a substantive response to the murder of our children! As a teacher and administrator for 45 years in public schools, I have been asked many times by my colleagues, parents and friends what it will take to stop this carnage in our schools. Each time a shooting occurred we asked the same question of one another. Will things change now? Surely they will change, right? But in truth after the Newtown shooting produced no meaningful response by the government, and no sanity about the sale of assault weapons, I found no reason to believe that things would change. Already Congress waffles and tries to move on from Parkland, and our president offers absurd solutions and pitiable comments about what he would do in the event of a school shooting. But now Dick’s Sporting Goods has stood up for what decency, morality and conscience demand. Not our elected representatives, who are sworn to protect our citizens, and not our president. It is way too early to have hope again, but at least it is heartening to know that there are those who will take steps to end the carnage. Action matters, not words. PATRICIA RANDALL YARMOUTH PORT, MASS. To the Editor: I shop at Dick’s Sporting Goods once or twice a year with my dad when I’m back home in Birmingham, Ala. But the plethora of people fawning over guns always made me just a bit uncomfortable. I’ve been living in New York for more than 25 years now, and my attitude toward the gun culture has evolved from acceptance to complete outrage. But I’ve always just bitten my lip when I’m back home, because no matter how many wonky numbers I cite or how morally superior I frame my arguments, it doesn’t do much good in changing hearts and minds in gun country. But when a retailer like Dick’s, which is part of the nation’s gun culture DNA, makes this sort of move, it probably has a greater impact than we realize. If more major retail icons make similar moves, it will likely move the cultural needle faster toward sensible gun control reforms, even changing the way gun lovers view assault weapons. CODY LYON, BROOKLYN To the Editor: Re “Delta Tax Cut Is Imperiled After Airline Shuns N.R.A.” (news article, Feb. 27): As a lifelong Georgian, I am disappointed to see Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle interfering in the business decisions of Delta Air Lines by threatening to kill a proposed tax cut if the airline doesn’t restore a National Rifle Association discount. A private corporation has a right to make its own decisions without state interference unless the state has a compelling reason to interfere, and pandering for votes (Mr. Cagle is running for governor) is not a compelling reason. Mr. Cagle is entitled to have an opinion about Delta’s action, but just as a more progressive administration shouldn’t be able to punish or reward FedEx for taking the other side of the issue, he should not be allowed to use the power of his office to punish or reward Delta.

Opinion,125," Supported by Opinion By Brad S. Karp and H. Christopher Boehning The survivors of the Parkland shooting have led a national call to action, and the nation has responded. Students have walked out of their schools in protest, businesses have cut ties with the N.R.A., and our collective frustration culminated in the March for Our Lives this weekend. Senator Charles Schumer has proposed three measures to reduce gun violence: expanded background checks, protective orders to disarm individuals at risk of violence or self-harm, and an assault weapons ban. These proposals are critically important. But there is another effective response that has been largely ignored: repeal of a law that prevents suits against the gun industry. A bedrock principle of the American legal system is accountability for wrongdoing. Businesses that cause harm may be held legally responsible in a court of law. Through the imposition of financial liability, our legal system encourages businesses to reduce harm to consumers by making their products safer and disclosing the risks associated with their use. Thanks in part to the accountability imposed by lawsuits, society knows more about the dangers of smoking, and tobacco companies market their products more responsibly. Automakers continually develop and install new safety features, and these innovations deliver results: From 1975 to 2016, the rate of motor vehicle deaths decreased by nearly half. While motor vehicle deaths have declined over the last two decades, firearm deaths have not: According to the most recent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people now die from firearms than motor vehicle accidents. This disturbing reality exists in large part because, unlike other industries, gun manufacturers and sellers are shielded from legal accountability. Bowing to years of intensive N.R.A. lobbying, Congress enacted the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in 2005. The law bars most suits against gun manufacturers and sellers for the harm they cause, immunizing the gun industry from accountability for the tens of thousands of gun deaths that occur in the United States each year. Young people — and, as the Parkland survivors Emma González and David Hogg so eloquently remind us, young people of color — are hit especially hard. A recent study shows that firearms are now the third-leading cause of death for children ages 1 to 17 and, according to C.D.C. data, the leading cause of death for 15- to 24-year-olds. Numerous scientific studies indicate that keeping guns in a home endangers its residents. Studies have also shown that guns in the home are far more likely to be used in criminal assaults, homicides, suicides and accidental shootings than in self-defense. Yet the law enables the gun industry to advertise its products as safety devices that consumers need to protect themselves and their families without fear of legal liability. After the Las Vegas shooting, in which 58 people were massacred and hundreds more injured, lawsuits were filed against the companies that organized the concert, own the hotel and made and sold the bump stock device the killer used to increase the firing rate of his weapons — everyone but the companies that made and sold his guns. That is because the gun manufacturers and sellers have a weapon that is not available to the concert organizers and hotel owner — statutory immunity. The N.R.A. claims that the act is necessary to protect gun manufacturers and sellers against unfounded lawsuits. Unlike cars, hammers, tobacco and alcohol, its argument goes, guns are intended to kill. But our legal system has multiple checks to filter out lawsuits that lack merit. There is no reason for the gun industry to have special protections that are unavailable to other businesses that sell products that pose far less risk of harm. One element of the N.R.A.’s argument is true: Guns are inherently dangerous. But there are proven ways to make them safer. One study found that more than 40 percent of accidental gun deaths could have been avoided if the gun was equipped with at least one safety feature. Because of the act, gun manufacturers have no incentive to include such features. After the Parkland shooting, American Outdoor Brands, Smith & Wesson’s parent company and the manufacturer of the weapon used in the Parkland shooting, announced that it would not “manufacture and market” products with additional safety features (including trigger-locking technology) and that it does not “invest in R. & D. in this area” because doing so would be “irresponsible.” Perhaps the repeal of the law would change this cynical narrative. Gun sellers likewise enjoy broad immunity. They can sell dozens of weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition to a single buyer who could resell them on the black market or plan a mass shooting without fear of legal accountability. Federal law requires only a perfunctory background check, and the employee handling the background form may be an untrained clerk. Without the threat of civil liability, gun sellers have no incentive to adopt more rigorous procedures or to provide training to their employees, which could stop a violent tragedy at the point of sale. Democrats in Congress have introduced a bill to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. Congress should pass that bill. The gun industry doesn’t deserve a special legal perk that immunizes it from liability. And the victims of gun violence deserve their day in court. Brad S. Karp is the chairman and H.

Washington,126," By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVISFEB. 23, 2018 President Trump reiterated his support for arming school personnel during a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference. President Trump condemned on Friday a Parkland, Fla., sheriff’s deputy who stayed outside the school he was patrolling while a shooting rampage unfolded inside last week, even as he insisted that his proposal to arm well-trained teachers would have prevented the massacre. “When it came time to get in there and do something, he didn’t have the courage, or something happened, but he certainly did a poor job — there’s no question about that,” Mr. Trump said of Scot Peterson, who resigned on Thursday after surveillance video showed that he had failed to enter Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland to confront the gunman as he was killing 17 people. “He was there for five minutes — for five minutes,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. “That was during the entire shooting. He heard it right from the beginning. So he certainly did a poor job, but that’s a case where somebody was outside, they’re trained, they didn’t act properly under pressure, or they were a coward.” He spoke on his way to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., where he continued to promote his proposal — embraced by the National Rifle Association — to allow some teachers and other educators to carry concealed firearms in schools. He said on Thursday that such teachers should be paid a small bonus, and that he would devote federal resources to training them to use weapons to protect students.  “These teachers love their students, and these teachers are talented with weaponry and with guns,” Mr. Trump said Friday during a fiery speech to the conservative gathering, where he said that Democrats wanted to revoke Second Amendment rights.  “I’d rather have somebody that loves their students and wants to protect their students than somebody standing outside that doesn’t know anybody, and doesn’t know the students, and frankly, for whatever reason, decided not to go in even though he heard lots of shots being fired inside,” Mr. Trump said, referring to Mr. Peterson. He said the officer “was not a credit to law enforcement.” Speaking of the gunman in Parkland, Mr. Trump added that if his idea had been in place, “a teacher would have shot the hell out of him before he knew what happened.” It was the third time in three days that Mr. Trump, who has vowed to take swift action after the latest school shooting, has championed the idea of transforming schools into fortified zones where educators would secretly be carrying weapons to guard against attacks. Mr. Trump is under pressure to embrace stiffer gun restrictions, including a ban on assault weapons and limits on high-capacity ammunition, despite vehement N.R.A. opposition. The president has instead seized on the idea of loosening gun laws to protect schools. “Why do we protect our airports and our banks, our government buildings, but not our schools?” Mr. Trump said. “It’s time to make our schools a much harder target for attackers.” He said declaring schools gun-free zones “puts our students in far more danger.” Mr. Trump, who was endorsed by the N.R.A. during his campaign and has been an ardent ally, suggested that he was pressuring the gun lobby to accept measures it had deemed objectionable. But the two proposals he mentioned on Friday — improving background checks for gun buyers and ensuring that mentally ill people cannot have access to firearms — are both supported by the group. Later Friday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that lawmakers would join forces with him to address the tragedy, particularly on the issue of background checks.      “We’re going to do a lot, but we are going to be very strong on background checks,” Mr. Trump said during a news conference at the White House with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia. “I’ve spoken with many of our people in Congress — our senators, our congressmen and women — and there’s a movement on to get something done.”  But Democrats were stepping up their calls for more restrictive gun laws, far beyond what Mr. Trump suggested. “It’s time for Republicans in Congress to show just a shred of the courage of American students,” Representative Ted Deutch, the Democrat who represents Parkland, said in the party’s weekly radio address. “It’s time for Speaker Ryan to let the House vote to require background checks on every sale and transfer, to keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists, to outlaw bump stocks that enable automatic rates of fire, to require that no one under the age of 21 can buy a gun, and to once again ban assault weapons from our streets.” Mr. Trump’s comments on arming teachers were part of a highly partisan speech to the conservative gathering — an annual meeting that draws the hard-right activists who form the backbone of his political coalition — in which the president proclaimed that his first 12 months in office “the most successful first year in the history of the presidency.” He referred to Democrats as “crazed,” and said his opponents had “committed a lot of atrocities.” His remarks were met with rapturous applause. On a day when his former top campaign aide, Rick Gates, pleaded guilty in the special counsel’s inquiry into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Trump smiled broadly as the crowd chanted “Lock her up!” in a campaign refrain that referred to Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival. Appearing at ease among some of his most fervent supporters, Mr. Trump returned to his well-worn list of campaign themes — “Don’t worry, you’re getting the wall,” he told the crowd — and even poked fun at his trademark bright-blond pompadour after catching a glimpse of his image on a giant screen in the convention hall. “Oh, I try like hell to hide that bald spot, folks, I work hard at it,” he said. “It doesn’t look bad. Hey, we are hanging in, we are hanging in, we are hanging in there — right?” But most of his speech had a harder edge. Mr. Trump outlined his efforts to step up immigration enforcement and crack down on so-called sanctuary cities, those that decline to cooperate with federal immigration authorities to track and remove undocumented immigrants. And he returned to a favorite campaign-trail routine of reciting the lyrics to a song called “The Snake,” about a woman who takes in an ailing snake that recovers and repays her hospitality with a lethal bite — suggesting an analogy between immigrants and a poisonous reptile. “Think of it in terms of immigration,” Mr. Trump said, before reciting the verses for the cheering audience. When he finished, he said, “And that’s what we’re doing with our country, we’re letting them in.” Mr. Trump ended the address with a call to action for Republicans, and warned that they must not be complacent about getting out to vote in 2018 and defeating Democrats. “They want to give your money away, they want to end your tax cuts, they want to do things you wouldn’t believe — including taking your Second Amendment rights away,” Mr. Trump said. “They will do that, so we have to get out there, and we have to fight in ‘18 like never before.” A version of this article appears in print on February 24, 2018, on Page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: Trump Vilifies Deputy Who Failed to Act During School Killings.

Opinion,127," Supported by David Leonhardt By David Leonhardt and Ian Prasad Philbrick This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Dispatch from David: Whither stevia? After we published our guide to eating less sugar, several readers wrote to us to ask about stevia: Why was it included on the list of sweeteners people should minimize? Isn’t it natural? Here are some answers: • There is no perfect definition of “natural,” but, under most reasonable definitions, many versions of stevia fail to qualify. “I know the stevia producers say it’s not artificial because it’s extracted from plants, but really it’s not,” as Marion Nestle, an N.Y.U. food researcher, says. “It’s mostly synthesized.” • There is little reliable information about the health effects of stevia. Makers of the product have financed several studies that found — get ready to be shocked — no harmful effects of eating it. But you shouldn’t trust industry-financed research. It has a long history of bias. “Unfortunately, we don’t have reliable evidence on stevia,” says Laura Schmidt of the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine. • If you had to choose between a normal sweetener (like granulated sugar, honey, corn syrup or maple syrup) and a calorie-free sweetener (like stevia or sucralose), you’re probably better off choosing the calorie-free sweetener. The research is pretty clear on normal sweeteners: Most Americans eat far more than is healthy. The research on artificial sweeteners is murkier. The evidence so far suggests that they’re not as damaging — and may be fine. • But the best advice is to cut down on all sweeteners, including the artificial varieties. For one thing, their long-term effects could end up being worse than we realize. For another, eating them doesn’t help you recalibrate your palate away from the sickly sweet modern American diet. “Here’s what I tell people for now,” Schmidt told me. “There is little question that artificial sweeteners keep the palate tolerant to a high level of sweetness. For those wanting to reduce sugar consumption and cravings, we want to retrain the palate to enjoy foods and drinks that aren’t heavily sweetened.” She added: “So artificial sweeteners may be best used as a temporary strategy for reducing sugar consumption. Consider them as part of a strategy for gradually stepping down off sugar, but not as a long-term replacement.” Bottom line: Stevia isn’t a magical solution. In The Times. John Paul Stevens, the former Supreme Court justice, argued in a Times op-ed yesterday that the Second Amendment should be repealed. The piece generated a large amount of reader responses, some of which you can read here and here. And Isabelle Robinson, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, argues that treating disaffected kids like the Parkland, Fla., shooter with kindness won’t necessarily stop them from hurting others.

Well,128," By TARA PARKER-POPEMARCH 30, 2018 Today’s teenagers have been raised on cellphones and social media. Should we worry about them or just get out of their way? A recent wave of student protests around the country has provided a close-up view of Generation Z in action, and many adults have been surprised. While there has been much hand-wringing about this cohort, also called iGen or the Post-Millennials, the stereotype of a disengaged, entitled and social-media-addicted generation doesn’t match the poised, media-savvy and inclusive young people leading the protests and gracing magazine covers. There’s 18-year-old Emma González, whose shaved head, impassioned speeches and torn jeans have made her the iconic face of the #NeverAgain movement, which developed after the 17 shooting deaths in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Naomi Wadler, just 11, became an overnight sensation after confidently telling a national television audience she represented “African-American girls whose stories don’t make the front page of every national newspaper.” David Hogg, a high school senior at Stoneman Douglas, has weathered numerous personal attacks with the disciplined calm of a seasoned politician. Sure, these kids could be outliers. But plenty of adolescent researchers believe they are not. “I think we must contemplate that technology is having the exact opposite effect than we perceived,” said Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and author of “How to Raise an Adult.” “We see the negatives of not going outside, can’t look people in the eye, don’t have to go through the effort of making a phone call. There are ways we see the deficiencies that social media has offered, but there are obviously tremendous upsides and positives as well.”  “I am fascinated by the phenomenon we are seeing in front of us, and I don’t think it’s unique to these six or seven kids who have been the face of the Parkland adolescent cohort,” says Lisa Damour, an adolescent psychologist and author of “Untangled: Guiding Teenage Girls Through the Seven Transitions Into Adulthood.”  “They are so direct in their messaging. They are so clear. They seem unflappable.” Dr. Damour, who has spent her career talking and listening to teenagers, said she believes the Parkland teens are showing the world the potential of their peer group. “Those of us who live with teenagers and are around them can see something that is different about this generation,” she said. There is still much to learn about the postmillennial cohort — social scientists haven’t even agreed on when this generation begins, although there seems to be a consensus forming that the year 2000, give or take a few years, is a good place to start. But data collected from various health surveys already show that today’s teens are different from previous generations in many ways. Many risky behaviors have dropped sharply among today’s teens. Cigarette smoking among teens is at a historic low since peaking in the mid 1990s. Alcohol use has also declined significantly — the number of teens who have used alcohol in the past 30 days is down by half since the 1990s. Teen pregnancy rates have hit historic lows, and teens over all are waiting longer to have sex than their parent’s generation. Teen driving fatalities are down about 64 percent since 1975. Some of that is attributed to safer cars, but teen crashes have declined between 10 and 30 percent in states with tiered licensing systems, and teen drunken driving has dropped while teen seatbelt use has increased. While most health researchers celebrate these changes in teen health, some scientists think the trends suggest a lower level of maturity among today’s teens. Perhaps teens are safer simply because their reliance on social media and smartphone use means they are getting out less. In September, the journal Child Development published a study by Jean Twenge, a psychology professor at San Diego State University, noting that there is a decline in a number of “adult” activities among today’s teens. In seven large, nationally representative surveys of eight million American adolescents from 1976 to 2016, fewer adolescents in recent years are having sex, dating, drinking alcohol, driving, working for pay and going out without their parents. “The big picture is that they are taking longer to grow up,” said Dr. Twenge, whose latest book is “iGen: Why Today’s Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy — and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood.”      In an article in The Atlantic last fall titled “Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?,” Dr. Twenge argued that teens are more comfortable in their bedrooms or on smartphones or social media than at a party. While they are physically safer than past generations as a result, rates of teen depression and suicide are on the rise. “It’s not an exaggeration to describe iGen as being on the brink of the worst mental-health crisis in decades,” she wrote. “Much of this deterioration can be traced to their phones.” But a number of social scientists and adolescent health researchers disagree with that conclusion. While teen depression and suicide rates are worrisome, there is no causal link to show those trends are the result of smartphones and social media. In fact, a  literature review by Unicef researchers in December found that moderate use of digital technology tends to be beneficial for children’s mental well-being, while no use or too much use is associated with a “small negative impact.” The larger issues that affect a child’s well-being are family functioning, social dynamics at school and socio-economic conditions, the report concluded. Don Tapscott, author of “Grown Up Digital,” said he believes today’s teenagers are better communicators than any previous generation. “They didn’t grow up being the passive recipients of somebody else’s broadcast,” he said. “They grew up being interactors and communicators. In the 1960s we had a generation gap. What we have today is a generation lap — they are lapping their parents on the digital track.”  The clinical psychologist Wendy Mogel interviewed groups of middle school and high school students around the country in 2015 and 2016 for her new book, “Voice Lessons for Parents: What to Say, How to Say It and When to Listen.” Dr. Mogel spoke with diverse kids from various regions and walks of life, but found herself consistently impressed by their thoughtfulness, how much they liked their parents, and how much they cared about the world around them. “The press and general public like to see them as spoiled and not having to work hard for anything except grades and being very entitled,” Dr. Mogel said. “But they’re courageous, energetic, optimistic and really smart.” Neil Howe, a historian whose books include “Millennials Rising,” said that unlike earlier generations, today’s teens have accepted the structures of society and have learned to work within those boundaries. “They’re very good at using rules to make their point, and they’re absolutely excellent at negotiating with their parents, and negotiating in a reasonable way about how to bend these rules in a way that will make them more effective and give them more space,” he said. “This is not a ‘throw the brick through the window and burn stuff down’ group of kids at all. They’re working very constructively, arm-in-arm with older people they trust, to make big institutions work better and make them stronger and more effective.” Ms. Lythcott-Haims notes that the current crop of teenagers is the first generation to grow up with active shooter drills since kindergarten. “I think what we might have here is a generation that really defines itself by the markers of their childhoods,” she said. “In addition to being marked by these gun violence tragedies, they came to consciousness with a black man in the White House and smartphones in their hands.” What does all this mean for the future of today’s teens? All of the researchers agreed there is still much more to learn about this cohort, but what we know so far is promising. “We are in the process of distilling the data and discerning who they are, but I am excited,” said Ms. Lythcott-Haims. “We don’t know who they will be in their 20s, but already they have agency, the sense of your own existence, your own right to make decisions and your own responsibility for outcomes and consequences. That’s what we need to have to be mentally well. I think these folks could turn out not to be just leaders, but to be a generation that we look back on and end up calling one of the greatest.”  ",2018-03-30,0.047805578,Friday
National,129," Supported by By Richard A. Oppel Jr., Serge F. Kovaleski, Patricia Mazzei and Adam Goldman The warnings that law enforcement officials received about Nikolas Cruz were anything but subtle. “I know he’s going to explode,” a woman who knew Mr. Cruz said on the F.B.I.’s tip line on Jan. 5. Her big worry was that he might resort to slipping “into a school and just shooting the place up.” Forty days later, Mr. Cruz is accused of doing just that, barging into his former high school in Parkland, Fla., and shooting 17 people to death. Three months before the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a family friend dialed 911 to tell the Palm Beach County sheriff’s office about Mr. Cruz’s personal arsenal. “I need someone here because I’m afraid he comes back and he has a lot of weapons,” the friend said. Mr. Cruz, 19, himself called the authorities just after Thanksgiving, describing how he had been in a fight and was struggling with the death of his mother. “The thing is I lost my mother a couple of weeks ago, so like I am dealing with a bunch of things right now,” he said in a childlike voice, sounding agitated and out of breath. The authorities have acknowledged mishandling numerous warning signs that Mr. Cruz was deeply troubled. There were tips to the F.B.I. about disturbing social media posts. There were visits by social services to his home. There were dozens of calls to 911 and the local authorities, some mentioning fears that he was capable of violence. Reviewing the transcripts of those calls, and listening to the audiotapes of some of them, is a chilling exercise that makes Mr. Cruz’s arrest in one of America’s deadliest school shootings seem less than a complete surprise. (Read the transcripts here.) In a 911 call on Nov. 29, Rocxanne Deschamps, the family friend who took in Mr. Cruz after the death of his mother, expressed fear that he was going to get a gun after fighting with her son. Ms. Deschamps lives in a faded, off-white mobile home, where Mr. Cruz and his younger brother, Zachary, stayed with her briefly. In Ms. Deschamps’s 911 call, she told the dispatcher that Mr. Cruz already had about eight guns that he kept at a friend’s house and that he had just been thrown out of the house after the tantrum in which he punched the walls, hurled things around her home and got into a fight with Rock, her 22-year-old son. “He got pissed off and then he came in the house and started banging all the doors and banging in the walls and hitting the walls and throwing everything in the room,” she said. “And then my son got in there and he said, ‘Stop it,’ and he didn’t want to stop.” She added: “It’s not the first time he put a gun on somebody’s head.” Ms. Deschamps made it clear that her new houseguest was obsessed with firearms and had threatened both his mother and his brother. “That’s all he wants is his gun,” she said. “And that’s all he cares about is his gun. He bought tons of bullets and stuff and I took it away from him.” Ms. Deschamps declined to comment on Friday, and her lawyer did not respond to phone messages and emails over the past week. More than once, Mr. Cruz was identified by those around him as someone capable of carrying out a school shooting. On Nov. 30, two and a half months before the Parkland massacre, an unidentified caller from Massachusetts told the Broward County Sheriff’s Office that Mr. Cruz was collecting guns and knives and that “he could be a school shooter in the making.” Two years before, the office reported receiving “thirdhand information” from the son of one of Mr. Cruz’s neighbors that he “planned to shoot up the school on Instagram.” The tip that the F.B.I. received in early January from someone close to Mr. Cruz suggested that he owned a gun and had talked about carrying out a school shooting. But the bureau failed to investigate, even though the tipster said Mr. Cruz had a “desire to kill people, erratic behavior and disturbing social media posts.” That information should have been sent to the Miami F.B.I. field office, the bureau said. The F.B.I. also received a tip from a bail bondsman in Mississippi in September about a suspicious comment left on his YouTube channel by a “nikolas cruz” who professed a desire to be a “professional school shooter.” The bondsman notified YouTube, which promptly took down the comment. The F.B.I. said it did not have enough information to determine if “nikolas cruz” was a real name or a pseudonym, and the bureau said it could not justify keeping a file on the tip open and closed it in October. When the second tip reached the F.B.I. in West Virginia in January, a specialist was able to view the earlier tip, too. But even then, the specialist, in consultation with her supervisor, decided that there was not enough evidence to pursue it and that it did not appear to be an imminent threat. The acting F.B.I. deputy director, David L. Bowdich, briefed congressional staff members about the case on Friday and acknowledged the bureau’s failure to investigate, according to three people with direct knowledge of the meeting. Over the course of the January call, which lasted more than 13 minutes, the tipster warned the F.B.I. that Mr. Cruz had been adrift since his mother’s death in November. She said that Mr. Cruz had “the mental capacity of a 12 to a 14 year old.” The tipster provided four Instagram accounts for Mr. Cruz, which she said showed photos of sliced up animals and the firearms he had amassed. The caller, whose name was redacted on the transcript, said Mr. Cruz had used money from his mother’s account after her death to purchase the weapons. “If you go onto his Instagram pages, you’ll see all the guns,” the woman said. Before calling the F.B.I., the woman telephoned Broward sheriff’s deputies in Parkland, worried that Mr. Cruz might kill himself. But she did not hear back from them and became increasingly alarmed after she said Mr. Cruz posted online that “he wants to kill people.” Two deputies have been placed on restricted duty while the Broward office investigates how two calls about Mr. Cruz — the one in November and an earlier one in 2016 — may have been mishandled. Before she died in early November, Mr. Cruz’s mother, Lynda Cruz, had called the authorities numerous times over the past decade to report her son. She said he had hit her with the plastic hose from a vacuum, and once threw her against the wall after she took his Xbox away, adding that he suffered from anger issues as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Mr. Cruz progressed to more distressing behavior, including possibly shooting a neighbor’s chicken with a BB gun, collecting hate symbols, cutting himself, and possibly swallowing gasoline in a failed suicide attempt, according to complaints to the local authorities.

Upshot,130," Supported by The new activists are hoping the old patterns of weak support will change.  By Margot Sanger-Katz When you ask Americans in a poll whether they support universal background checks for gun purchases, huge majorities say yes. Ask them for a specific vote for such a legal change, and that support drops off. In recent years, there have been three true tests of this question. In Washington State and Nevada, voters said yes. In Maine, they said no. Ballot measures in all three earned a much smaller vote share than the initial polling suggested. The results illustrate the political challenges facing the student-led activists who are marching in Washington and other cities this weekend to push for stronger gun laws. While a wide range of gun control laws appear popular in polls, support may soften once details emerge and they’re subjected to a robust political debate. In survey after survey, background checks are the most popular gun control measure, with support frequently over 80 percent. A recent Quinnipiac poll, taken after the deadly shootings last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., had support at 97 percent. Background checks are popular among Democrats and Republicans, gun owners and those without guns.   Many gun measures get high marks in polls. In 2016, The Upshot asked Morning Consult to survey voters about 29 possible gun laws. Only one, which would have required gun owners to demonstrate a “genuine need” before being allowed to have a weapon, garnered less than majority endorsement. Our results are roughly consistent with a range of polls from a number of outlets, which show that many gun control ideas are popular in surveys.  But political consultants who have worked on ballot measures say that it can often be easy for opponents of gun laws to chip away at very strong initial public support for a given policy. That’s a dynamic that is true of all ballot measures, where voters must be persuaded to overcome a normal bias in favor of the status quo.  “You’re not asking people what is your sentiment,” said Zach Silk, the president of the public policy firm Civic Ventures, who led the 2014 background check effort in Washington and was a consultant for Nevada’s initiative in 2016. “It’s getting them to think about what system they want.” More broadly worded polling questions, such as those that ask people if they value controls on gun ownership or protection of gun rights, show a public that is much more closely divided. Americans remain split in their views of the National Rifle Association, the country’s most prominent gun rights group. Mr. Silk said he likes to look at those responses, and support for an assault weapons ban, as good approximations of overall public support for gun restrictions, because all three questions force people to contend with the inherent trade-offs between enhanced safety and restrictions in rights. He said recent surveys, which show growing support for more restrictive laws on guns and assault weapons and declining support for the N.R.A., feed his optimism that the country may be experiencing a “phase shift” on guns.  But David Farmer, who led the Maine effort for universal background checks in 2016, said that supporters of gun rights can be particularly persuasive once a concrete proposal is unveiled. In Maine, polling support for the measure declined between introduction and the final vote, before failing, 52-48. “We know for a fact we lost the argument at the kitchen table and the bar and the bowling alley,” he said. “The gun enthusiasts were talking to their friends and relatives and neighbors. They felt about it in a way that was so passionate that they won those one-on-one encounters, and they were very successful in bringing in people to their side.” The enthusiasm of gun rights activists doesn’t show up just in personal conversations. Over the last few decades, they have been more likely to speak to their legislators or give money to gun-related political groups, according to research from the Pew Research Center. Those actions have sent a signal to legislators that there is robust opposition even to laws that show strong public support in polls. John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a group that favors stricter gun laws, thinks the energy imbalance is shifting. He said the group’s donations, membership and Instagram follows have all risen since the Parkland shootings, a suggestion, he said, that members of the public who back Everytown’s agenda are increasing the intensity of their support.  He also noted a string of recent state legislative successes on gun restrictions for domestic abusers, including some in Republican-led states, and the recent passage of a law in Florida that allows judges to temporarily confiscate guns from people who are judged a threat. (On Friday, an N.R.A. spokesman declined to offer the organization’s views of public opinion on gun measures.) Mr. Farmer said he is also optimistic that his side can do a better job of persuading voters in the future. He said he’s particularly heartened by the recent groundswell of activism by young Americans. He said he sees parallels between their energy and that of the opposition. Several polls since the Parkland shootings show a rise in support for gun restrictions, including some that go beyond universal background checks. President Trump’s proposal to arm schoolteachers has received more lukewarm support — with fewer than 45 percent of the public supporting it in two recent surveys. It will take some time to see whether the trends hold. Margot Sanger-Katz is a domestic correspondent and writes about health care for The Upshot.

Washington,131," By SHERYL GAY STOLBERGMARCH 14, 2018 WASHINGTON — With hundreds of high school students massed at the Capitol to demand gun control, the House instead approved modest legislation on Wednesday to beef up school security without changes to the nation’s gun laws, hoping to answer demands for action a month after the massacre in Parkland, Fla. Across Capitol Hill, a top F.B.I. official conceded in Senate testimony that his agency had made mistakes in failing to follow up on tips about the gunman. “We clearly should have done more,” David L. Bowdich, the acting deputy director of the F.B.I., told the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said the bureau was doubling the number of supervisors assigned to review tips from the public. The House vote and the Senate hearing came as students across the country  walked out of their classes to demand tougher gun laws after the rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Hundreds rallied in front of the White House and at the Capitol, cheered on by congressional Democratic leaders.  But the school safety bill had no provisions relating to guns, and the Senate hearing was focused on law enforcement failures. Gun control advocates said neither addressed what they saw as the real problem: the proliferation of high-powered firearms used in mass shootings, not only at schools but at concerts, churches, movie theaters and other public places.  The House measure, which passed 407 to 10 as dozens of students looked down from the visitors’ gallery, is one of a flurry of school safety bills that have been introduced in Congress — without curbs on guns. It authorizes $500 million over 10 years for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous tip lines to detect threats. The money could also be used for physical improvements, such as metal detectors, but at the insistence of Democrats, a provision was added that bars the money from being used to arm teachers. Known as the STOP School Violence Act, the bill was sponsored by Representative John Rutherford, a Republican and former sheriff of Jacksonville, Fla., who called it “an important first step towards keeping our students and our teachers safe.” White House officials have said President Trump supports the measure; a similar one has been introduced in the Senate. But Democrats lamented that it did not go far enough. “The bill is fine as far as it goes, and we should certainly do more to make our schools safer,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York. “But it is shameful that we must do so because of our failure to reduce the threat of gun violence to children.”      On the Senate side of the Capitol, Mr. Bowdich, of the F.B.I., suffered a grilling from Judiciary Committee members about the bureau’s failure to follow up on at least two credible tips related to the Parkland gunman, Nikolas Cruz. The first tip, in September, came via email, from a bail bondsman in Mississippi who spotted a suspicious comment on a YouTube channel by a “nikolas cruz” who said he intended to become “a professional school shooter.” The second came in January from a woman who called the agency’s tip line and said, “I know he’s going to explode.” “In my judgment we have seen a catastrophic and systemic failure of law enforcement at every level,” Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said, before asking Mr. Bowdich if he believed that the F.B.I. “had committed serious, grave errors.”  Mr. Bowdich’s reply was succinct: “Yes, sir, I do.” The committee also heard emotional testimony from Ryan Petty, whose daughter Alaina was among the 17 people killed at Stoneman Douglas High School, and Katherine Posada, a language arts teacher at the school. “Nikolas Cruz and the danger that he posed were the worst kept secret in Parkland,” Mr. Petty said. Ms. Posada chided lawmakers for what was an apparent partisan divide, with Republicans confining their questions to law enforcement issues and Democrats using the session to put a spotlight on gun control. “This is not a partisan issue,” the teacher said. “The children of Republicans can fall victim to bullets.”  ",2018-03-14,0.04750954,Wednesday
Opinion,132," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Shana Rosenthal The video above is based on the following letter, which I wrote to my senator, Marco Rubio, in the wake of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. I urge you to hold your elected officials accountable by sending them a letter and tagging them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and whatever other social media platforms you use. Dear Senator Rubio, I am writing to you as a former employee of your Tallahassee, Florida office. My sophomore year at Florida State University, I accepted a non-partisan internship at your Tallahassee, Fla. location. As an eager, young Political Science student, I was excited to get my foot in the door of a Senator’s office; however, I was dismayed when your staff told me that you probably wouldn’t be present for the duration of my internship. As it turns out, they were right – I worked for your team for five whole months, twenty hours a week, and never once saw you in the office. As an intern, I was tasked with fielding constituents’ calls and writing their comments into a call log, which was sent to you at the end of each week. Supposedly, you used this log to address the needs of constituents, but I am skeptical that you ever actually read through it. Now, three years later, I am one of those concerned constituents pleading for change from you, our elected Florida official. I am afraid, though, that my pleas for help will fall on the ears of another intern and go no further – but you can prove me wrong by taking action against gun violence. When I was 19-years-old, FSU – my home away from home – experienced a campus shooting. On November 20, 2015, Myron May approached the Strozier Library on FSU’s campus and opened fire on students using a .380-caliber handgun. Three of my fellow colleagues were injured. May was mentally disturbed and consumed by paranoia to a point where he sought to murder people on my campus. Thankfully, during the shooting I was not at the scene of the crime, but rather, across the street sitting in my dorm. While I studied for my upcoming finals, students were being shot a few yards away from me. When I was 20-years-old, yet another community I hold close to my heart suffered a mass shooting. On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 58 others using an AR-15 style-rifle at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. Mateen specifically targeted LGBTQ+ Latinx/people-of-color that evening. I was about one mile up the same street from the massacre that night. Again, a blood bath occurred yards away from me and my friends. Less than 7 months later, tragedy struck while I was visiting home for winter break. January 6, 2017, Esteban Santiago-Ruiz used a Walther PPS 9mm semi-automatic pistol to gun down five individuals and injure six others at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The Broward County airport my family used to travel our entire lives became a warzone. Today, I am a 21-year-old college graduate and am writing this with great despair – and even more anger. On February 14, 2018, Nikolas Cruz used an AR-15 style-rifle to murder 17 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students and staff, and injured at least 14 more. I sat in my parents’ home, just around the corner from my alma mater, as children were being slaughtered. Once again, I sat in a silo of safety as a bloody massacre literally played out across the street. I’ve lived in the serene town of Parkland since I was three-years-old, and attended MSD for four formative years of my life. The hallways where I once shared laughter, curiosity, and hope are now crime scenes. Members of my community have lost their lives. Students and staff of MSD are traumatized. My tight-knit community of loving people is broken. I am in shock that one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history happened in Parkland, Fla., my hometown – the safest place in Florida. In my short lifetime, these countless acts of terror have plagued communities throughout the United States with unimaginable grief, and it is time for this pattern to stop. I will no longer feel helpless nor sit idly by while these atrocities occur. I will not accept mass shootings as the norm. It is YOUR responsibility as our elected official to pass laws that protect your constituents. This isn’t about party politics - this is about human lives. I am begging you to implement a systematic plan that will end the mass shooting epidemic in Florida and beyond, starting with: · Stricter gun licensing · Recognizing gun violence as a public health issue · Funding research on gun violence and gun violence prevention · Extensive background checks for gun purchases · Close loopholes in gun purchasing (i.e. gun shows) · Implementing a buffer period between purchasing a rifle and taking it home It is shameful that I have to write this and beg you to do SOMETHING. I hope you have read my letter free from the influence of wealthy lobbyists who may impede your senatorial judgment. I hope you read this letter at all.

Science,133," By BENEDICT CAREYFEB. 22, 2018 President Trump called again on Thursday for the opening of more mental hospitals to help prevent mass murders like the one at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Yet ramping up institutional care, experts say, likely would not have prevented most of the spree killings regularly making headlines in this country. “We’re going to be talking about mental institutions. And when you have some person like this, you can bring them into a mental institution, and they can see what they can do. But we’ve got to get them out of our communities,” the president said during a meeting at the White House with state and local officials. In the 1960s, states across the country began to close or shrink mental hospitals after a series of court decisions that limited the powers of state and local officials to commit people. The decline continued for decades, in part because of cuts in both state and federal budgets for mental health care.  Those institutions housed people with severe mental disorders, like schizophrenia, who were deemed unable to care for themselves. And while spree killers may be angry and emotionally disordered, few have had the sorts of illnesses that would have landed them in hospital custody.  The latest school shooter, Nikolas Cruz, 19, was clearly troubled and making threats, and he was stockpiling weapons. But he had no mental diagnosis. He has been described as angry, possibly depressed, perhaps isolated — not so different from millions of other teenagers.   We will not publish your contact information.

A full psychiatric evaluation, if he’d had one, might have resulted in a temporary commitment at best, but not full-time institutionalization, experts said. The idea that more such institutions would prevent this kind of violence “is ridiculous, because you can’t put half the people in the country with a mental disturbance in mental hospitals,” said Dr. Michael Stone, a forensic psychiatrist at Columbia University who has studied mass killers. He added: “Most of these shooters are angry, antisocial individuals you cannot spot in advance, and even if you could, you don’t have the right to institutionalize them.” The Sandy Hook murderer, who killed 26 elementary school children and teachers with an automatic weapon, did receive top-flight psychiatric attention at the Yale School of Medicine; he was not institutionalized. The notorious Columbine High School mass murderers, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, likely had depression (Mr. Klebold) and psychopathy, an inability to feel empathy (Mr. Harris), researchers have found. But neither diagnosis would have made them candidates for lengthy hospitalizations.      The same is true of Elliot Rodger, the young man who killed six people and wounded 14 others in Santa Barbara, Calif., and Dylann Roof, the racist church murderer in Charleston, S.C. Seung-Hui Cho, the Virginia Tech University shooter who gunned down 32 fellow students, had received a psychiatric evaluation — and was released. Stephen Paddock, the man who killed 58 people with assault rifles in Las Vegas last year, had no known mental health history.  And none of these men and boys had a history that remotely predicted their savage acts. The decline in mental hospitals over the past half-century is of central importance to mental health care in the United States. That decrease — to about 40,000 psychiatric beds in the country from some 500,000 in 1955 — has coincided with an increase in homelessness and, in recent decades, explosive growth in the number of people with mental disorders who end up in prison. Reversing that trend could have made a difference in two recent spree shootings, said Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center, which lobbies for more investment in psychiatric beds for people with severe mental illness. Jared Loughner, who killed six people and wounded former Representative Gabby Giffords of Arizona in a 2011 attack, was clearly psychotic and harbored dark fantasies. The same was true of James Holmes, the graduate student who gunned down 12 people in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. “I think these are instances where having a bed available could have helped, but there was nowhere to put them,” Dr. Torrey said. The one thing all of these murderers had in common was access to military-style weapons. Around the time psychiatric hospitals began to close, weapons designed for maximum kill ratios entered the market. The earliest school shootings, before the late 1960s, “were mostly young kids that got into angry arguments with teachers or with another pupil, sometimes in rivalry for a girlfriend, or because they got expelled — and they killed one or two persons, never large numbers of people,” Dr. Stone said. “For that, you need the semiautomatic guns that came in the late 1960s.” Follow @NYTHealth on Twitter. | Sign up for the  Science Times newsletter.

Business,134," Supported by By Tiffany Hsu Citigroup is setting restrictions on the sale of firearms by its business customers, making it the first Wall Street bank to take a stance in the divisive nationwide gun control debate. The new policy, announced Thursday, prohibits the sale of firearms to customers who have not passed a background check or who are younger than 21. It also bars the sale of bump stocks and high-capacity magazines. It would apply to clients who offer credit cards backed by Citigroup or borrow money, use banking services or raise capital through the company. The rules, which the company described as “common-sense measures,” echo similar restrictions established by some major retailers, like Walmart. But they also represent the boldest such move to emerge from the banking sector. Since the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last month, renewed calls for remedies to firearms violence have led to sweeping consumer boycotts and unprecedented moves by corporate America to distance itself from the powerful gun lobby. But federal lawmakers have taken limited action, and President Trump quickly abandoned a promise to pursue gun control measures, instead promoting proposals backed by the National Rifle Association to arm teachers. The financial services and investment community was even less engaged, staying mostly quiet on suggestions that it wield its considerable influence over gun merchants to encourage firearms-related changes. Citigroup’s gun policy has “been a while coming,” its chief executive, Michael L. Corbat, told The New York Times Thursday. Mr. Corbat, who called himself “an avid outdoorsman and responsible gun owner,” acknowledged that “some will find our policy too strict while others will find it too lenient.” “We don’t pretend that these answers are perfect, but as we looked at the things we thought we could influence, we felt that, working with our clients, we could make a difference,” he said. “Banks serve a societal purpose — we believe our investors want us to do this and be responsible corporate citizens.” Citigroup said it had begun to inform existing small business and credit card clients and commercial and institutional partners of its plan and would screen future partners using the new requirements. The bank said it has few gun manufacturing companies as clients, but those it does work with will be asked to provide details about their product and distribution networks. If business customers decline Citigroup’s restrictions, the bank said it would work with them to “transition their business away.” The company declined to name clients or describe the extent of affected partnerships but said that “real revenue is at risk” if relationships fall through and customers protest. Some of Citigroup’s clients, like Walmart, already adhere to the new policies. Citigroup said it did not have the technology nor the legal ability to monitor gun purchases at the payment-processing level, but said that the industry was discussing the possibility. Edward Skyler, an executive vice president at Citigroup who helped craft the policy, wrote in a blog post that the company’s announcement “will invite passion on both sides.” But he stressed that the policies were “not centered on an ideological mission to rid the world of firearms.” Following various mass shootings, “we have waited for our grief to turn into action and see our nation adopt common-sense measures that would help prevent firearms from getting into the wrong hands,” he wrote. “That action has sadly never come and as the weeks pass from the most recent mass shooting, it appears we remain in the same cycle of tragedy and inaction.” The company said it would not enforce a specific deadline and instead hoped to have all of its clients on board with the gun restrictions within a few months. Members of its corporate citizenship group, which also monitors whether clients engaged in coal mining and oil drilling are adhering to Citigroup’s environmental standards, will check in regularly on partners’ gun-selling procedures, the company said. The Citigroup board was supportive of the decision. Mr. Corbat said that, in many recent discussions about the new policy, “there hasn’t been a consensus, but we also haven’t come to this decision in a vacuum.” Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bank and Bank of America declined to comment on whether they had similar plans in the works. Alan Elias, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, said in a statement that “any solutions on how to address this epidemic will be complicated.” “This is why our company believes the best way to make progress on these issues is through the political and legislative process,” he said. “We are engaging our customers that legally manufacture firearms and other stakeholders on what we can do together to promote better gun safety for our communities.” Diane Zappas, a spokeswoman for PNC Financial Services Group, said that the company, which is “continuing to consider these issues,” had discouraged new loans to gun manufacturers since 2013 and had “very limited exposure” to clients that manufacture AR-15-style rifles like the kind used in the Parkland shooting. Wall Street is deeply tied to the sprawling, opaque gun industry through pension funds that buy into public gun companies, private equity firms with firearms holdings and financial institutions that back sizable loans to handgun and rifle manufacturers. In recent weeks, both Bank of America and the asset manager BlackRock said they had reached out to firearms manufacturers and distributors to ask about their responses to mass shootings, and strategies to stop them. American Outdoor Brands, the parent company of the Smith & Wesson gun brand, replied to BlackRock in a public letter earlier this month, saying that it respects the national debate about gun safety and shares “the nation’s grief” over the Parkland killings and “the desire to make our communities safer.” But American Outdoor, whose stock price has been more than halved since the 2016 election, stressed that “the solution is not to take a politically motivated action” that “results in no increase in public safety.” Last month, the First National Bank of Omaha, which said it would not renew a contract with the National Rifle Association to issue an N.R.A.-branded Visa card, led a quick succession of companies to cut ties with the trade group. The N.R.A. did not respond to requests for comment. YouTube said this week that it would start removing videos next month that promote the sale or manufacture of firearms and accessories, especially those that allow simulated automatic firing, like bump stocks. On March 12, the gun manufacturer Sturm Ruger addressed shareholder concerns in a letter that promised to continue manufacturing and selling semiautomatic firearms, or what the industry refers to as modern sporting rifles. In the letter, the company said that “succumbing to political pressure to do what is expedient” would fly “in the face of our fiduciary responsibility as stewards of the company for the benefit of shareholders.” Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.

Opinion,135," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Steve Israel It has been 38 days since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.; 174 days since the shooting at a concert in Las Vegas; 1,011 days since the killings at a church in Charleston, S.C.; and 1,926 since the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Ten days ago, students organized a nationwide school walkout to demonstrate their outrage about these and other shootings. On Saturday they plan to amass in Washington to pressure a Congress that has done nothing meaningful to protect American children in classrooms, movie theaters, churches, malls — because, thanks to the National Rifle Association, many of their elected representatives are too busy protecting their re-election. My advice to the students? When you finish marching on the mall, march into the specific congressional districts where you can actually make a difference. The midterm elections are in eight months. A vast majority of congressional districts have been gerrymandered bright blue or ruby red. In those deep-red districts, the only threat that far-right members of Congress face is a primary challenge from someone farther to the right. You may regard voting for universal background checks as a no-brainer, but they see it as a blemish on their N.R.A. rating — an open door to a primary challenge. That explains the unmovable fealty these representatives have to the gun lobby. But in this election there are more than 40 truly competitive districts, including many where you can make a real difference by helping replace an incumbent who consistently supports the gun lobby with a challenger who won’t. Go to the suburbs of Philadelphia, where Representative Ryan Costello (who has an A rating from the N.R.A.) is being challenged by several Democrats, including Chrissy Houlahan, a former Air Force captain who supports closing the loophole on sales at gun shows and renewing the federal assault weapons ban, among other steps. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s redrawing of the state’s district lines has transformed Mr. Costello’s already competitive district from one that was almost evenly split between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to one that supported Mrs. Clinton by 9 points. March to the southern tip of Florida, not to vacation in flip-flops but to flip a district. There, Representative Carlos Curbelo (who has a B+ rating from the N.R.A. and an “N.R.A. lap dog” label from the Brady Campaign) is also being challenged by several Democrats, including Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, whose father was shot to death when she was 24. Ms. Mucarsel-Powell supports banning the sale of military-style weapons like the AR-15 used in the Parkland shootings and would strengthen background checks so that domestic abusers, those affected by mental illness and terrorists can’t purchase guns. This district historically swings between Republicans and Democrats. You can push it the right way. Too hot in Florida? Try the suburbs of Minneapolis-St. Paul, specifically the Second and Third Congressional Districts. Mr. Trump was virtually even with Mrs. Clinton in the Second and lost to her in the Third. Representative Jason Lewis supported concealed-carry reciprocity, and opposed universal background checks and any ban on semiautomatic weapons. His neighbor, Representative Erik Paulsen, shares the same position on concealed-carry reciprocity and universal background checks. Both have A ratings from the N.R.A.; both have opponents supporting sensible gun security laws. You can canvass in the shadows of the Catskills in New York, in the suburbs of Denver and in Fairfax, Va. You can phone-bank in the competitive districts in Orange County, Calif., as well as the northern San Joaquin Valley, northern San Diego and eastern Los Angeles County. Ask your peers to show up at campaign events and town halls in the exurbs of Chicago and in Iowa. If you live in a heavily Democratic district in a place like New York State, your member of Congress is already with you. Send a note of thanks and support that incumbent. The possibility of change is beyond the horizon, literally, in that morphing of suburbs, exurbs and rural areas, in that convergence of districts with incumbents whose support for the gun lobby is virulent, but who, in the November election, are vulnerable. You don’t have to win every district. Replacing just a handful of incumbents in districts that are highly competitive while also offering a vivid contrast in positions on guns could bring the larger change you need and deserve. Why? Because there’s nothing on Capitol Hill more clarifying than watching colleagues pay the ultimate political price for their positions. Seeing a colleague defeated because of a hard-core position tends to soften the resistance of those who survive. March not left, nor right, but right up the middle, into those moderate competitive districts where high school students, people at the coffee shops and diners, and soccer moms and dads shake their heads at the intransigence of a member of Congress who won’t support enhanced background checks, “No Fly, No Buy” and other reforms. You can stage marches and school walkouts, but then walk into the swing congressional districts that matter. In the end it’s not about standing up to be heard. It’s about changing who sits in Congress.

Washington,136," By JEREMY W. PETERSFEB. 22, 2018 Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the N.R.A., addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference, warning that in the wake of the Florida school shooting, gun rights were under attack. OXON HILL, Md. — The head of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre, leveled a searing indictment on Thursday against liberal Democrats, the news media and political opportunists he said were joined together in a socialist plot to “eradicate all individual freedoms.” Mr. LaPierre’s remarks, his first since a gunman took the lives of 17 people at a Florida high school last week, seemed aimed at blunting the rising public pressure for stricter gun control. Conservatives, he said, needed to push back even as liberals tried to smear them. “The shameful politicization of tragedy — it’s a classic strategy, right out of the playbook of a poisonous movement,” he said to a friendly but largely restrained crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. “They hate the N.R.A. They hate the Second Amendment. They hate individual freedom.” The solution Mr. LaPierre offered was not to pass new laws but to better enforce the existing background check system and, he said, “harden our schools” with more armed guards.  “Evil walks among us,” he added, making a passing reference to “another terrible tragedy” in the Parkland, Fla., school massacre.  Mr. LaPierre’s pugnacious appearance appeared to signal a tactical shift for the N.R.A., which had officially remained mostly quiet in the week after the Florida shooting, even as a movement of young people, including survivors of the massacre, made emotional pleas for gun control. The organization typically uses the first few days after an episode of mass gun violence to lie low before it comes out hard in opposition to any new gun control measures. “The N.R.A. will not only speak out,” he said, “we will speak out louder and we will speak out stronger than ever before.” Mr. LaPierre, who for around three decades has been the N.R.A.’s public face of unwavering resistance to tighter restrictions on guns, used his speech to play to the fear and mistrust that many on the right have toward government. He raised the specter of mass gun confiscation. He accused federal agencies like the Justice Department of weaponizing their power to punish political enemies. He warned darkly that “our country will be changed forever” at the hands of socialist conspirators. “History proves it. Every time in every nation in which this political disease rises to power, its citizens are repressed, their freedoms are destroyed and their firearms are banned and confiscated,” he said, reading slowly and deliberately from his prepared text. Mr. LaPierre’s appearance each year at the conference, known as CPAC, is typically an event that passes without much notice. But this year, coming just a week after one of the worst school shootings in American history, CPAC seemed to take on the feel of an N.R.A. forum. Mr. LaPierre’s name was initially left off the program. Then, on Thursday morning, the conference’s organizers released a revised schedule with both Mr. LaPierre and Dana Loesch, an N.R.A. spokeswoman, added as speakers. The National Rifle Association’s online video channel has a wide range of programming, and that’s the point. Outside the hall where they spoke, an N.R.A. booth was broadcasting hours of online video programming from its in-house news channel, NRATV, which the organization has used as an early-warning system to alert its followers to gun control efforts.  Ms. Loesch, who just hours earlier had appeared subdued as she spoke softly in defense of the N.R.A. at a contentious forum in Florida hosted by CNN, reverted to the caustic, insult-lobbing persona she has cultivated on NRATV, where she is also a host. Speaking before Mr. LaPierre, she called for more guns in schools, denounced the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as political persecutors and accused liberals of trying to sabotage the existing background check system for gun purchases.      Ms. Loesch also blamed James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director fired by President Trump amid a dispute over the bureau’s investigation of possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russians, for indirectly causing the Parkland massacre. “Maybe if you politicized your agency less and did your job more, we wouldn’t have these problems,” she sneered. Ms. Loesch also saw fault for the shooting in the news media, saying killings were always good for business. “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” she said. “Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many in the legacy media in the back.” But the temperature on stage was noticeably hotter than in the audience, which gave Mr. LaPierre and Ms. Loesch polite but mostly unenthusiastic applause. Mr. LaPierre evidently noticed, prompting him to comment on the stillness in the hall, which he wrote off as fear over the government oppression he warned was coming. “I hear a lot of quiet in this room,” he said. “I sense your anxiety. And you should be anxious. You should be frightened.” He repeatedly returned to his attacks against gun control advocates as socialists lying in wait. “And oh how socialists love to make lists,” he said, “especially lists that can be used to deny citizens their basic freedoms.”  The Florida school shooting hung over many of the day’s speeches at CPAC. And with only small exceptions — like when Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, asked for a moment of silence for the victims — speakers directed blame and scorn on the news media. Ben Shapiro, a conservative podcast host and author, called on reporters to stop showing the faces and printing the names of school shooters, as he said his website had done. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said he found much of the news media coverage, including the emotional outpouring at a CNN forum on Wednesday, “tiresome.” “Every time you see a horrific crime, people in the media and Democratic politicians immediately try to leap on it to advance their agenda,” Mr. Cruz said. “And their agenda is stripping away Second Amendment rights away from law-abiding citizens.” He noted what he said was one of the biggest moments for applause at the CNN event: “It was about confiscating guns.” Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting from Washington.

National,137," By NIRAJ CHOKSHIMARCH 16, 2018 Nearly three out of four teachers oppose letting staff members carry guns in schools, according to a new poll that shows little support for a proposal that has become central to President Trump’s response to the school shooting last month in Parkland, Fla. Seventy-three percent of teachers oppose the idea of arming staff members, while 20 percent support it, according to the nationwide survey of almost 500 teachers of kindergarten through 12th grade conducted by Gallup and released on Friday. A majority of the public, 56 percent, also opposes the idea, according to a separate Gallup poll, though attitudes diverge greatly along partisan lines. 
            Nearly two thirds of teachers strongly oppose special training for teachers and staff to carry guns in schools.          MARCH 16, 2018 After the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 17 people dead, Mr. Trump stunned lawmakers by backing comprehensive gun control.  But that support was short-lived. Mr. Trump eventually reversed course, instead embracing the National Rifle Association-backed policies of arming teachers and making incremental improvements to the background check system.  Many teachers fear that allowing guns in schools will burden them with responsibilities that fall outside their role while needlessly exposing students and staff members to danger. Just this week, a California teacher accidentally discharged a firearm in a classroom during a public safety course. One student was struck in the neck by bullet shrapnel while two others were hit by debris. The Gallup poll shows that not only do teachers broadly oppose being armed, but few believe it would make schools safer and even fewer would take advantage of such a policy. 
            The vast majority of teachers say allowing staff to carry guns will make schools less safe.         MARCH 16, 2018 Just 20 percent said that arming some staff members and teachers would make schools safer, while well over half said they would be less safe as a result. Even if allowed to do so, only 16 percent said they were somewhat or very confident that they would apply to carry guns in schools. More than 80 percent would not apply. 
            Even if allowed, the vast majority of teachers would not apply to carry guns in school.         MARCH 16, 2018 While teachers and the public oppose arming school staff members, Gallup did find broad public support, even among partisans, for some policies aimed at preventing or mitigating mass shootings. More than 90 percent of the public supports increased active shooter training for police officers and emergency medical workers, as well as background checks for all gun sales. More than 85 percent back additional security screening for people entering schools and new programs to identify and manage students who may pose a threat to their peers.

Opinion,138," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Isabelle Robinson PARKLAND, Fla. — My first interaction with Nikolas Cruz happened when I was in seventh grade. I was eating lunch with my friends, most likely discussing One Direction or Ed Sheeran, when I felt a sudden pain in my lower back. The force of the blow knocked the wind out of my 90-pound body; tears stung my eyes. I turned around and saw him, smirking. I had never seen this boy before, but I would never forget his face. His eyes were lit up with a sick, twisted joy as he watched me cry. The apple that he had thrown at my back rolled slowly along the tiled floor. A cafeteria aide rushed over to ask me if I was O.K. I don’t remember if Mr. Cruz was confronted over his actions, but in my 12-year-old naïveté, I trusted that the adults around me would take care of the situation. Five years later, hiding in a dark closet inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, I would discover just how wrong I was. I am not writing this piece to malign Nikolas Cruz any more than he already has been. I have faith that history will condemn him for his crimes. I am writing this because of the disturbing number of comments I’ve read that go something like this: Maybe if Mr. Cruz’s classmates and peers had been a little nicer to him, the shooting at Stoneman Douglas would never have occurred. This deeply dangerous sentiment, expressed under the #WalkUpNotOut hashtag, implies that acts of school violence can be prevented if students befriend disturbed and potentially dangerous classmates. The idea that we are to blame, even implicitly, for the murders of our friends and teachers is a slap in the face to all Stoneman Douglas victims and survivors. A year after I was assaulted by Mr. Cruz, I was assigned to tutor him through my school’s peer counseling program. Being a peer counselor was the first real responsibility I had ever had, my first glimpse of adulthood, and I took it very seriously. Despite my discomfort, I sat down with him, alone. I was forced to endure his cursing me out and ogling my chest until the hourlong session ended. When I was done, I felt a surge of pride for having organized his binder and helped him with his homework. Looking back, I am horrified. I now understand that I was left, unassisted, with a student who had a known history of rage and brutality. Like many pre-teenage and teenage girls, I possessed — and still, to an extent, possess — a strong desire to please. I strive to win the praise of the adults in my life and long to be seen as mature beyond my years. I would have done almost anything to win the approval of my teachers. This is not to say that children should reject their more socially awkward or isolated peers — not at all. As a former peer counselor and current teacher’s assistant, I strongly believe in and have seen the benefits of reaching out to those who need kindness most. But students should not be expected to cure the ills of our genuinely troubled classmates, or even our friends, because we first and foremost go to school to learn. The implication that Mr. Cruz’s mental health problems could have been solved if only he had been loved more by his fellow students is both a gross misunderstanding of how these diseases work and a dangerous suggestion that puts children on the front line. It is not the obligation of children to befriend classmates who have demonstrated aggressive, unpredictable or violent tendencies. It is the responsibility of the school administration and guidance department to seek out those students and get them the help that they need, even if it is extremely specialized attention that cannot be provided at the same institution. No amount of kindness or compassion alone would have changed the person that Nikolas Cruz is and was, or the horrendous actions he perpetrated. That is a weak excuse for the failures of our school system, our government and our gun laws. My little sister is now the age that I was when I was left alone with Mr. Cruz, anxious and defenseless. The thought of her being put in the same situation that I was fills me with rage. I hope that she will never know the fear that I have become so accustomed to in the past month: The slightest unexpected sound makes my throat constrict and my neck hairs curl. I beg her to trust her gut whenever she feels unsafe. And I demand that the adults in her life protect her. Isabelle Robinson is a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

Washington,139," By KATIE BENNERMARCH 23, 2018 WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Friday that the Justice Department was proposing to ban so-called bump stocks through regulations rather than wait for Congress to act, a move that defies recommendations by federal law enforcement officials and could subject the department to litigation from gun rights groups. Mr. Sessions’s announcement came moments after President Trump said on Twitter that the Justice Department would imminently announce a rule banning bump stocks. 
            Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.         It also comes amid rising public pressure on Washington to curb gun violence after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead last month. Students will gather Saturday in Washington to protest gun violence for an event called March for Our Lives. The Justice Department’s proposed rule “would define ‘machine gun’ to include bump-stock-type devices under federal law — effectively banning them,” Mr. Sessions said in a statement.  The proposed bump stock ban would defy the conclusion of Justice Department officials who have said that they could not, under existing law, stop the sales of bump stocks, accessories that allow semiautomatic guns to mimic automatic fire, and that congressional action was needed to ban them. But Mr. Sessions said the department had worked around those concerns.  “After the senseless attack in Las Vegas,” Mr. Sessions said, “this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress.” The 55-page proposal, which was published for public comment, said it was redefining machine guns to include bump stocks because “such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.” The proposal would force bump stock owners to surrender or destroy them the day the rule would go into effect. A previous Justice Department review, done by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was prompted by the mass shooting last fall in Las Vegas, where a gunman killed 58 people using semiautomatic weapons outfitted with bump stocks. By working around the A.T.F.’s earlier interpretation, the Justice Department essentially said that the statute had not changed, but that it could now be read in a different way. By reinterpreting the conclusion that was made under President Barack Obama, the Justice Department could open itself up to lawsuits when the rule is finalized. Litigation would tie up the bump stock ban in the courts. Legal experts say that groups that sue could win because bump stock makers specifically designed the devices so they could not qualify as machine guns under the law. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     “When you pull the trigger once on a machine gun, multiple bullets fire, whereas each pull of a trigger fires a single round with bump stocks,” said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston. “People designed it this way deliberately to keep bump stocks from being defined as machine guns under the statute. It’s like the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. The first is specifically to avoid being illegal.”  The controversial new rule is in keeping with Mr. Sessions’s practice of closely hewing to White House political directives, sometimes remaining silent in the face of criticism from Mr. Trump and other times rebuking his own employees. Before the Justice Department issued any measures of its own, Mr. Trump had publicly declared that he would use executive authority to ban bump stocks, and he ordered the department to find a way to prohibit them. This month, the Justice Department announced an array of initiatives designed to address the issue of gun violence, sometimes echoing measures that had already been proposed by Mr. Trump. The department said it would help local law enforcement officials hire more school resource officers, help local firearms training programs work with teachers and help states provide faster, more accurate and complete information to databases used in federal firearms background checks. It also said it would provide a $1 million emergency grant to Florida to help cover law enforcement costs related to the Parkland shooting. Mr. Trump had said earlier that he supported the inclusion of mental health information in the background check system and the arming of teachers as part of an effort to deter school shootings. Mr. Sessions also ordered federal prosecutors to more aggressively prosecute gun buyers who lie on gun purchasing applications, a move that The New York Times reported last month. Each year, thousands of prospective gun owners who apply to buy guns through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System are found unqualified to purchase a firearm.  It is a felony to lie on that application, but the crime is rarely prosecuted. From 2008 to 2015, prosecutors considered fewer than 32 cases a year, according to the Justice Department’s inspector general. “Under my tenure as attorney general, we have already increased federal gun prosecutions to a 10-year high — and we are just getting started,” Mr. Sessions said when he announced those measures. Those past directives acknowledged that gun violence is a problem, but they were unlikely to upset opponents of more restrictive gun policies. In the past, the National Rifle Association has supported some forms of bump-stock regulation, the enforcement of existing gun laws and some background check legislation. But the Justice Department’s latest move, which Mr. Sessions previewed in an announcement this month, will be met with more opposition. “You need Congress to pass a statute,” Mr. Blackman said. “That’s how you change a law, not through executive action.” Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.

Washington,140," By ERICA L. GREENFEB. 17, 2018 A chorus of Democratic lawmakers have joined the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, in calling for Congress to act after a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla. In a letter on Friday, all 17 Democrats on the House Education Committee urged Representative Virginia Foxx, the committee’s chairwoman, to convene hearings on school shootings, describing them as a “public health epidemic.” The panel has not addressed the issue since February 2013 — two months after a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut left 20 first graders and six adults dead, they said. “Wednesday’s preventable tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, resulted in the deaths of at least 17 students and faculty,” the letter said. “Sadly, since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School five years ago, more than 430 people have been shot in over 230 school shootings.” The letter adds pressure on Congress to address the pervasiveness of school shootings across the country, an issue that Ms. DeVos raised during an interview on Thursday with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.  “Congress needs to be holding hearings on these issues,” Ms. DeVos said, adding: “We’ve seen, you know, lots of finger pointing back and forth. But we need to have a conversation at the level where lawmakers can actually impact the future, because going back to and putting myself in the seat of one of those families impacted, one of these shootings is one too many. And we have got to have an honest conversation, and Congress has to lead on this. It’s their job.” Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Education Committee, said she “wholeheartedly” agreed with the suggestion and invited Ms. DeVos to testify.  “Families across the country are tired of waiting for Congress to step up, have the tough conversations, and adopt common sense gun safety and other policies to end this scourge in our schools and communities,” Ms. Murray said in a statement. Asked whether she believed teachers should be allowed and trained to carry weapons, Ms. DeVos said only that it was “an important issue for all states to grapple with and to tackle,” and that it “needs to be part of the broader, more robust conversation about how can we avoid these things in the future.”      Ms. DeVos did not say whether her department would encourage superintendents to work with law enforcement to identify troubled students. But she echoed a sentiment expressed by President Trump about the need to address mental health issues, and noted that the suspect in the shooting, Nikolas Cruz, “put up lots and lots of signals and warning signs.” The Education Department has not indicated whether Ms. DeVos would visit Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. In April, she made an unannounced visit to San Bernardino, Calif., shortly after a shooting at North Park Elementary School left one student injured and another student and special education teacher dead. That same day, Mr. Trump delivered an address at the annual convention for the National Rifle Association, which provided at least $30 million in support during his presidential campaign.

Opinion,141," Supported by Letters To the Editor: Re “Florida Shooting Suspect Displayed Flashes of Rage and Other Warning Signs” (front page, Feb. 16): Every time there is a mass shooting, and a suspect is identified, endless media attention is devoted to examination of the alleged perpetrator’s behavior and demeanor before the tragedy. The implication seems to be, if only people had paid attention, the carnage somehow could have been prevented. The truth is, there will always be angry young men, and angry older men, and women, too. And, although very few of us are potential mass murderers, who among us has never felt “flashes of rage”? I feel one every time I read another gun-rights advocate piously offer “thoughts and prayers” to relatives and friends of the victims of assault weapon violence. DAVID ENGLISH, ACTON, MASS. To the Editor: In response to the news that President Trump is going to visit the high school in Parkland, Fla., to offer his condolences, the obvious question is, “Is President Trump capable of empathy?” In his responses to tragedies like these, he seems to be going through the motions, feigning feelings through words that don’t seem to be his own, likely written by his staff. It is impossible to imagine Mr. Trump overcome by emotion and breaking down in tears, as President Obama did in talking about Sandy Hook. The only emotions he shows are rage and affront, at imagined slights to his own stature. He shows no feeling for anyone else’s suffering. He should just go golfing, and stop pretending to care. JOHN RANTA, HANCOCK, N.H. To the Editor: Re “After Tragedy, the President Again Focuses on Mental Health” (news article, Feb. 16): The focus on people with mental illness is misplaced. People with severe mental illness are more likely to be victimized than to be victimizers. And we don’t do a good job predicting risk of violence. What we do know is that children and youths suspended or expelled from school are at risk. Youths with behavioral problems who are expelled have high rates of emotional disturbance and are very likely to have continued behavioral problems. Some school districts have piloted special programs to reduce suspensions and expulsions; they include mandatory mental health screening and stepped-up outreach for youths in trouble. Let’s stop stigmatizing entire swaths of our population and really get to the root of the school violence problem. EDWARD COHEN, SAN JOSE, CALIF. The writer is a professor at the School of Social Work, San Jose State University. To the Editor: If only the incredible courage of the high school staff in Parkland who offered their lives in attempting to shelter their students would be matched by the members of Congress. These incredibly weak and selfish people appear to consider only their own skins and political agendas. JANET R. DAVIDSON, SEATTLE To the Editor: As a deer hunter, I am consistently shocked by the destructive impact of a high-powered rifle round. Perhaps it is time to show the public what is really going on in these tragedies. As painful and terrible as it would be, especially for the families of victims, it may be time to release graphic video of the victims. The images would be horrible and stomach-turning. It was such graphically offensive images that started to turn the public’s opinion against the Vietnam War. It’s time to bring this war at home into the living room to turn the tide against it. Let assault weapon lobbyists try explaining those images to their children. CHARLES ROBERTSONCRANFORD, N.J. To the Editor: Re “The N.R.A.

If I were still a young man I would try to organize a national strike of high school students.

MIAMI — Florida’s nickname has long been the “Gunshine State” because of its plethora of firearms and loose gun restrictions. Then a troubled teenager stormed into a South Florida high school and shot 17 people dead. On Friday, in a dramatic turnaround in one of the most gun-friendly states in America, Gov. Rick Scott signed into law an array of gun limits that included raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21 and extending the waiting period to three days. It was the most aggressive action on gun control taken in the state in decades and the first time Mr. Scott, who had an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association, had broken so significantly from the group. The sweeping and bipartisan law is named after Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, where a former student, Nikolas Cruz, was charged with launching the massacre on Feb. 14. The law imposes new restrictions on firearm purchases and the possession of “bump stocks,” funds more school police officers and mental health services, broadens law enforcement’s power to seize weapons, and allows certain staff members to carry guns in schools. Florida’s embrace of gun restrictions came as Congress remains mired in partisan divisions on the issue and as other states, from Illinois to Vermont, consider whether they ought to tighten the rules on gun ownership in the wake of the Parkland attack. Florida’s action gave hope to gun control proponents and sent the N.R.A. scrambling to contain the damage.  Within hours of Mr. Scott signing the legislation, the N.R.A. filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court, arguing that Florida’s age restriction was “a blanket ban” that violated the Second Amendment, as well as the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection.  The N.R.A. asserted that the law was a particularly egregious violation of the rights of young women, who they contended “pose a relatively slight risk of perpetrating a school shooting such as the one that occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, or, for that matter, a violent crime of any kind.” Standing with a group of families who had traveled to the State Capitol from Parkland, an emotional Mr. Scott called the classmates of the slain students and their parents his inspiration, and praised them for helping persuade lawmakers to pass legislation, even if neither they nor he agreed with all of its provisions. “You made your voices heard,” he told the Stoneman Douglas High students. “You helped change your state. You made a difference. You should be proud.” Outside of Tallahassee, the law might not look that groundbreaking: It does not go as far as laws enacted by other more Democratic-leaning states after deadly shootings. Connecticut expanded a ban on assault weapons, prohibited the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines and imposed stricter background checks on gun purchases after 20 children and six educators were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in 2012. Colorado required background checks for private gun sales and limited magazines after 12 people were killed at a movie theater in 2012. But this is Florida, a laboratory for the N.R.A. and a state that has become recognized for its consistent efforts under legislative Republican control since 1996 to expand gun rights. For example, residents only have to comply with a simple protocol to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons. And Florida has embraced “Stand Your Ground” laws that protect the use of deadly force in public. That such a gun-friendly state adopted any firearm restrictions represents a sea change, even more so as the restrictions were drafted and approved in a matter of three weeks, after a bipartisan vote and the signature of a Republican governor likely to be on the ballot later this year as a Senate candidate. “If you would have had this conversation with me before session, I would’ve said it’s just not going to happen,” said Senator René García, a moderate Republican from the Miami area who has served 16 years in the Legislature. “Not only did we get this bill passed, but the fact that we had debate on these amendments on the floor was huge. I don’t remember having these debates on the floor ever before.”  The N.R.A. has had to contend with other states also considering action since the Parkland shooting. In Illinois, lawmakers passed a bill last week that would require gun dealers to be licensed by the state, but it was not clear whether the Republican governor would sign it into law. In Vermont, lawmakers advanced legislation that would raise the minimum age to buy a gun to 21 and allow for judges to seize guns from people deemed dangerous. Elsewhere, legislators took steps toward expanding the legal use of firearms. In Mississippi, state senators approved a bill on Wednesday that would allow trained school employees to carry concealed weapons. And in Missouri, a House committee last week advanced a bill that would allow people with concealed-carry permits to have a weapon in so-called gun-free zones.      The law’s passage came as a surprise to many in Florida, where lawmakers had failed to enact legislation after the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016, which left 49 dead, and the shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport that killed five people in 2017. The governor mentioned both crimes on Friday. Lawmakers like Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, voted against the bill because it did not include a ban on assault weapons or other broad measures sought by survivors of all the shootings. “The bill doesn’t deal with the real problem at all: The problem is guns,” he said. On the other side of the debate, lawmakers from the most conservative rural districts and Republicans seeking statewide office in contested primaries opposed the new law, saying it trampled on Second Amendment rights. “I just can’t imagine that Nikolas Cruz can commit such a heinous crime and then, as a result, we tell potentially a 20-year-old single mother living alone that she cannot purchase a firearm to protect herself,” Representative Jay Fant of Jacksonville, a Republican running for attorney general, said on the House floor. Mr. Scott can afford to break with the gun lobby now because he is unlikely to face a Republican primary in his expected Senate campaign against Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, in the midterms in November. In signing the bill, Mr. Scott offered a glimpse at how he might use the legislation in the coming campaign to paint Congress as ineffective. “If you look at the federal government, nothing seems to happen there,” Mr. Scott said, noting he was enacting legislation just three weeks and two days after the rampage. “That’s how government should work.” Mr. Scott remains opposed to the provision in the law that the N.R.A. has been seeking for years: Allowing for certain teachers and school staff to be armed on campus. But he called the legislation a compromise and noted that the so-called guardian program is voluntary: “If counties do not want to do this, they simply can say no.” The state’s largest and most urban school districts are expected to do just that.  In Tallahassee, the families who joined Mr. Scott chose Tony Montalto, whose daughter, Gina, was killed in the Parkland shooting, to deliver a statement calling the legislation “an important first step to enhance the safety of our schools.” “When it comes to preventing future acts of horrific school violence, this is the beginning of the journey,” Mr. Montalto said. “We have paid a terrible price for this progress.” Rebecca Schneid, 16, the editor of The Eagle Eye, the Stoneman Douglas High student newspaper, also applauded the bill, even while admitting it was “not perfect.” “I never really expected to get something done so fast,” she said. “We’ve been calling them out, and that really scared them. And that’s scaring them into making sure they actually do represent us. They know that if they don’t, we’re going to vote them out.” “We’re going to keep sending people to Tallahassee,” she went on, “because when we go away, this goes away.” Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.

National,143," By MATTHEW HAAG and MATT STEVENSFEB. 21, 2018 It was a day of tense exchanges, emotion-packed speeches and confrontation as lawmakers, students and parents sparred on Wednesday over what to do about shootings in American schools. From the nation’s capital to Florida’s State House, people affected by gun violence delivered pain-laced addresses to crowds of passionate supporters, and President Trump listened to a group he had summoned to discuss the problem. There was also some poignant symbolism. Here are some of the most remarkable moments: At an intense town hall-style meeting Wednesday night, Diane Wolk Rogers, a history teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., confronted a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association over the Second Amendment. How did allowing the 19-year-old shooter in last week’s massacre to own an assault rifle represent “a well-regulated militia” as is written in the amendment, she asked. “Using supporting detail,” Ms. Wolk Rogers said to thunderous applause at CNN’s “Stand Up” town hall, “explain to me how an 18-year-old with a military rifle is well regulated.”  Dana Loesch, the national spokeswoman for the N.R.A., said the phrase in the Second Amendment was meant to protect the rights of anyone who “could operate and service their firearm.” Her answer was roundly booed.

She was among the 17 people killed at Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14.  “I’m never ever going to see my kid again,” Mr. Pollack told the president. “Never ever will I see my kid. I want that to sink in. It’s eternity. My beautiful daughter, I’ll never see again.” Andrew Pollack, who lost his daughter in the Florida shooting, was a guest at a listening session at the White House. Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School flooded the  Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee on Wednesday to urge lawmakers to pass legislation addressing gun violence in the two weeks that remain in the legislative session. One of the students, Sarah Chadwick, a junior at the school, said she had a simple message for legislators: “Never again.” “Never again should a child be afraid to go to school,” Ms. Chadwick said, speaking in the Capitol’s rotunda. “Never again should students have to protest for their lives. Never again should an innocent life be taken while trying to gain an education.”

He said his best friend had been killed. “I turned 18 the day after, woke up to the news that my best friend was gone,” Mr. Zeif said. “I don’t understand why I could still go into a store and buy a weapon of war.”  He mentioned the massacre at Columbine High School in 1999, and the killing of 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. “How is it that easy to buy this type of weapon?” he said. “How did we not stop this after Columbine, after Sandy Hook?” Samuel Zeif, a survivor of the Florida shooting, spoke to President Trump about how it felt to lose a friend who was “practically a brother.” Spencer Blum, one of the Stoneman Douglas High students who traveled to Tallahassee for demonstrations, said his friends were still mourning the loss of their classmates. But he said so many of the school’s students had mobilized because they are angry. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     “We’re angry, we’re pissed, we’re ready for action,” Mr. Blum said in an interview on CNN. “We are ready to make ourselves be heard.”

Also, it does not appear that anyone tracks the political affiliation of mass killers. “Obviously there’s a lot of politics in it,” Ms. Tenney said. “And it’s interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats. But the media doesn’t talk about that either.”  Outside the Florida State Capitol, Sheryl Acquaroli, another student at Stoneman Douglas High, shouted into a microphone, laying blame squarely at the feet of federal lawmakers. Using a series of rhetorical questions, she demanded action from congressional leaders, as supporters screamed in response and a drummer beat out a rhythmic reply. “Dear Congress,” Ms. Acquaroli yelled, “how can you claim to stand for the people but let your kids get slaughtered like animals in their own school? Why is it that every time we make a step forward you force us back?” “How many of the thoughts and prayers I have received do I have to check in for some damn action?” she continued. “The next person who dies because of an AR-15,” she said, “will be on you.” Sheryl Acquaroli, a survivor of last week’s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, called for stricter gun control outside the Florida state capitol, in Tallahassee. Before a crowd of fellow students in Tallahassee, Florence Yared said it was not too early after the latest mass shooting to discuss changing gun laws. “I’m not trying to take away your Second Amendment rights, nor am I trying to eliminate all guns, but we cannot protect our guns before we protect our children,” Ms. Yared said. Florence Yared, a survivor of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, addressed a crowd of protesters outside the Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee. Inside the Florida State Capitol, Alfonso Calderon assailed the notion that, as young people, students would be unable to understand the situation well enough to speak out about it. “Trust me, I understand,” said Mr. Calderon, a Stoneman Douglas High student. “I was in a closet, locked, for four hours with people who I would consider almost family, crying and weeping on me, begging for their lives. “I understand what it is like to text my parents: ‘Goodbye, I might never ever, ever get to see you again. I love you,’” he added. “I understand what it is like to fear for your life.” Alfonso Calderon, a survivor of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School speaking at the Florida state Capitol, called for stricter gun control. Students at schools across the United States walked out of class on Wednesday to honor the victims of the Stoneman Douglas High shooting. At Coral Springs High School in Florida, hundreds of students stood on a football field to form the shape of a heart.

Washington,144," By EILEEN SULLIVANMARCH 12, 2018 WASHINGTON — President Trump confirmed on Monday that his administration would not immediately pursue a proposal to raise the age limit for buying an assault rifle, going back on earlier pledges that he made after last month’s deadly mass shooting at a South Florida high school. In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump said there was “not much political support (to put it mildly).” 
            Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law. Armed guards OK, deterrent!.......         
            ....On 18 to 21 Age Limits, watching court cases and rulings before acting. States are making this decision. Things are moving rapidly on this, but not much political support (to put it mildly).         In the pair of tweets, the president said the White House fully backs strengthening background checks and banning the use of bump stocks, which can turn a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic one. The White House also will move forward with its controversial plan to arm trained teachers with concealed firearms. In the wake of the Feb. 14 shooting that killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, Mr. Trump had initially said he would pursue raising the age limit to purchase assault rifles to 21 from 18. But after a meeting with the powerful National Rifle Association, Mr. Trump appeared to back down from that proposal, raising questions about the influence of the N.R.A.

National,145," Supported by By Alan Blinder FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Among the suspects on the list of the country’s 10 worst mass shootings, Nikolas Cruz is alone in one thing: He was taken alive. His arrest raises the rare prospect of a death penalty trial for a massacre, a huge undertaking with far-reaching consequences for all involved. Some would not be satisfied without an execution, while for others the trial itself would bring anguish. The chief prosecutor here in Broward County has said that the killing of 17 people at a high school on Valentine’s Day “certainly is the type of case the death penalty was designed for.” A trial may be the only opportunity to lay bare all of the facts. But it would also likely be televised and followed by lengthy appeals, provoking years of public agony, as well as sustained attention for Mr. Cruz, who has already confessed. Over years of mass shootings, from a university campus in Huntsville, Ala., to a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., prosecutors have struggled with this conundrum, testing political winds, spending days talking with survivors and families of the dead and reflecting on the intersection between morality and the oath of office. Even Broward County’s public defender, whose office is representing Mr. Cruz and who wants to save his life, readily acknowledges the wrenching emotions that are part of a case that is only beginning. “If it were my daughter, I would want to personally kill my client, make no mistake about it,” said Howard Finkelstein, the public defender, an elected position. Later, though, he said that perhaps he would “try to go on and build a future. I don’t know what I would do. I just don’t know.” Already, Mr. Finkelstein’s office has offered a way to avoid a trial: Mr. Cruz’s guilty plea in exchange for a punishment of 17 consecutive life sentences without parole. But Mr. Finkelstein recognizes that for some victims, that might not be enough: “I’m a father. I don’t know whether I would take my offer.” Relatives of the victims of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., have not yet made their feelings about the death penalty widely known. And it is not clear where Michael J. Satz, Broward County’s prosecutor, is in his deliberations. He declined to comment. Mr. Satz, who was elected state attorney when Gerald R. Ford was president, is regarded as a hard-edged prosecutor, but he is still likely to consider an array of factors, including the odds of persuading a jury. Although jurors condemned men for massacres in Charleston, S.C., where nine churchgoers were killed, and at Fort Hood, Tex., where there were 13 fatalities, they spared the life of the Aurora gunman who killed 12, citing his history of mental illness. In the Huntsville shooting, the prosecutor said his conversations with the families of the victims were a reason he did not seek execution. Several states are considering a ban on capital punishment for people with mental illnesses or brain injuries. George Brauchler, the lead prosecutor in the Aurora case, said he had engaged in “serious soul-searching” about whether to pass up a plea deal and seek the death penalty. “This is as much a moral decision as it is a decision about justice, and that is not an easy decision to make,” he said. “Until you are signing your name to a piece of paper that starts the machinery of government against another human being to take their life, whether it’s deserved or not, you don’t know what you’re talking about.” Mr. Brauchler said he had met with his Roman Catholic priest, and conferred with family members of the victims as well as survivors of the attack. Some of the conversations were tense and punctuated by yelling. Some people urged a measure of mercy for the gunman, Mr. Brauchler recalled, while others said, “I want to put the needle in his arm.” In the end, Mr. Brauchler said, he did not find the gunman’s mental illness defense credible. Death penalty cases are the criminal justice system’s most complex, expensive and emotionally taxing. It can take weeks or even months to present volumes of evidence that can include autopsy after autopsy and the painstaking recollection of every crack or boom of gunfire and every word the killer uttered. The trials can wear down even the most experienced experts. When it came time to cross-examine a survivor of the Charleston attack, a defense lawyer, David I. Bruck, said only: “Ms. Sheppard, I’m so sorry. I have no questions.” A crucial consideration in potential capital cases, prosecutors and defense lawyers said, is whether failing to seek the death penalty in a mass shooting would set a precedent, making it more difficult to seek it in cases with lower death tolls. In Charleston, the federal government had a sharp internal debate, and met with resistance from family members of victims, before it decided to seek the death penalty against Dylann S. Roof. “The death penalty itself becomes a participant in the decision, almost as if the death penalty is given a seat at the table,” said Mr. Bruck, who represented Mr. Roof during the guilt phase of his trial but was sidelined by the defendant during the penalty phase, when jurors decide whether a death sentence is appropriate. “There are plea agreements in a lot of cases,” Mr. Bruck said. “When there are, it’s usually because the prosecution recognizes — and sometimes the larger community recognizes — that there are things to consider outside of just whether or not we can kill this person.” For defense lawyers seeking to spare their client’s life, an appeal to efficiency is one of the few cards they can play — particularly when, as Mr. Finkelstein says, the “case is not a whodunit.” Expecting that Mr. Satz will seek the death penalty, Mr. Finkelstein and his deputies are already preparing for a “long, arduous legal battle” and intend to concentrate on jury selection. Because juries must unanimously recommend death sentences in Florida, a single juror could prevent execution. Mr. Finkelstein said the defense would likely focus on mental health and the accumulation of failures by government agencies to stop Mr. Cruz from opening fire. Melisa McNeill, the assistant public defender who has appeared with Mr. Cruz in court and would likely be the lead lawyer if there is a trial, did not respond to a message on Friday. In Florida, where 347 people are on death row after an execution on Thursday night, state law spells out a roster of aggravating factors and mitigating circumstances that jurors may consider in capital cases. Aggravating factors, at least one of which must be proven for someone to be eligible for a death sentence, include a finding that a defendant “knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons” or that a homicide was “committed in a cold, calculated and premeditated manner.” Mitigating circumstances, like a defendant’s age and whether he or she was under the “influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance” at the time of the crime, can legally tilt jurors toward a punishment of life in prison. Mr. Finkelstein made plain that he is dreading any trial here, and not just for legal reasons. In his dimly lit office, he raspily declared a hope that “divine intervention” would persuade Mr. Satz to avoid a trial and an airing of the tragic details. “This is the most awful thing, not only that I’ve ever seen — that I’ve even imagined in some sick movie or imagination. This was hell on earth,” he said. “It’s awful because of what was done to these poor kids. It’s awful because of the families that will never be the same. It’s awful because of the community, and it’s awful to be involved representing anybody when the community hates and hurts so much because of that person.”        Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS",2018-02-24,0.044500053,Saturday
Express,146," By CHRISTINE HAUSERMARCH 15, 2018 A sister of Dylann Roof, the man who massacred nine black churchgoers in South Carolina in 2015, was arrested on Wednesday for bringing a knife, pepper spray and marijuana to her high school, the authorities said. Morgan Roof, 18, was arrested on drugs and weapons charges at her high school, A.C. Flora, in Columbia, S.C., and taken to a detention center, Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said in a statement. Sheriff Lott said that a school resource officer was informed by an administrator that Ms. Roof had the weapons and drugs. “Roof had also made a social media post on Snapchat which caused alarm to the student body,” Sheriff Lott said. No students were harmed, he said. Ms. Roof’s Snapchat post criticized students who planned to walk out of class to protest gun violence. “I hope it’s a trap and y’all get shot,” it said. “We know it’s fixing to be nothing but black people walkin out anyway.”

Glenn Detention Center in Columbia, and local media reported that her bond was set at $5,000. It was not immediately clear whether she had been released or if she had a lawyer. Ms. Roof’s parents did not respond to requests for comment.  The arrest of Ms. Roof took place as thousands of students at schools across the country participated in a walkout to protest gun violence, in honor of the 17 students and staff members who were shot to death last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. While the Snapchat post was not cited as a reason for Ms. Roof’s arrest, Susan Childs, the principal of A.C. Flora High School, said in a letter to parents on Wednesday that several events on campus had caused concern. Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.     She said that the walkout at the school “went well with only a minor verbal disagreement,” but that an unloaded weapon had been recovered and was being investigated by law enforcement. She also said that a report of another weapon had been found to be inaccurate, and that a student had used social media “to post a hateful message.” She did not mention Ms. Roof by name. “The posting was not a threat, but was extremely inappropriate,” Ms. Childs wrote. “That student was dealt with in a swift and severe manner as the posting caused quite a disruption.”  Ms. Childs could not be reached for further comment on Thursday. The sheriff’s department said that in a separate case, two 16-year-old students were arrested after a handgun was found on school grounds on Tuesday. Gov. Henry McMaster said on Twitter Wednesday evening that “potential tragedy was avoided” at the school. “In two separate incidents, students and educators reacted quickly to reports of suspicious activity and behavior to their Richland County Sheriff’s Department school resource officer,” he said. Governor McMaster, a Republican, had called the walkout a “shameful” political statement in a television appearance earlier on Wednesday. “It appears that these school children — innocent school children — are being used as a tool by this left-wing group to further their own agenda,” he said. Mr. Roof killed the parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in June 2015. The avowed white supremacist opened fire during a Bible study gathering in a long-planned assault. He was found guilty in 2016 of all 33 federal counts against him and has been sentenced to death.

                Tech We’re Using             By

                MARCH 28, 2018 How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Julie Turkewitz, a correspondent who is based in Denver, discussed the tech she’s using. How often are you on the road on assignment? I’m on the road about a third of the year. I cover a section of the West, which means I spend a lot of time in small towns and on winding mountain roads. I also work breaking news stories all over the country. So that must mean you live out of a suitcase. What are your most essential tech tools for doing your work? My travel bag is a constant work in progress. I try to be prepared for anything, because I never know when a trip is going to involve a surprise sit-down with a governor or an unexpected flight to cover a hurricane.  For all the talk about the changing media landscape, the most important tools of my job are a pen, a notebook and a way to file the story to my editors. There are still many places in America without cellphone or internet service, so simply communicating with my editors can be a challenge. I’m often filing on a laptop from the back seat of a car on the side of a road over a weak signal through my phone or a mobile hot spot.  I carry two phones (in case one falls in the mud), a power strip that allows me to charge my computer from the car, and a Canon 5D camera that I bought off a White House photographer years ago. I use my iPhone’s recording app, or a downloadable app called TapeACall, and I will occasionally pay for a transcription service for lengthy interviews. I’ve used both Trint.com and Rev.com. When I’m working on breaking news stories, Twitter is crucial. Law enforcement agencies send out updates through social media, and the first thing I do when I head into a big story is make sure that I'm receiving their new tweets as immediate text messages. Then I use social media to report the texture of the story as it unfolds. Beyond breaking news, I’ve found Twitter to be a great tool for conveying a sense of place. Sometimes a single picture or video can really cut to the heart of a story.

She's an immigrant frm El Salvador who spent more than an hr wading thru this to get to work at the Doubletree. pic.twitter.com/rwTeDVuupZ         Lastly, roving reporters have to take care of themselves. I travel with an extra thin yoga mat from Manduka that packs down to the size of a book. Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.     What could be better? We need longer-lasting batteries. Battery life is a constant source of stress for reporters in the field. You’ve reported extensively on the Parkland, Fla., school shooting and many other such shootings. After Parkland, the survivors used Twitter and other outlets to speak out about gun control. Do you foresee this use of social media having any effect on gun control regulations?  We’re already seeing that happen. Several of the Parkland students now have tens of thousands of followers on Twitter, and they have been using that tool to speak directly to people in power. And when Gov. Rick Scott of Florida passed a major gun bill recently, he credited the students for making it possible. I’m curious to see what’s next. Will social media messaging continue to be as powerful as the weeks go on? And how will students deal with their new roles as survivors, advocates and public figures? Has tech affected how you research and investigate the people you write about? Social media has expanded the reporter-subject relationship, making it more personal, and allowing for interaction beyond the life of a particular story. This means that I sometimes contact people on Facebook to ask for an interview, and stay connected to them for weeks or months. As a reporter covering a vast region — and as someone who focuses on capturing national narratives and sentiments — I find social media to be a helpful way to avoid a news bubble. It keeps me connected to Montana and Utah and Wyoming even when I can’t be there. Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life? Audible audiobooks and Spotify playlists have gotten me through many a road trip. But my current obsession is taking time off from technology. As someone who spends a lot of time linked to the internet, I try to spend off-days away from devices. I buy books. I keep a physical calendar, not a digital one. I get two papers on Sundays and have several magazine subscriptions. And I try to spend as much non-travel time in face-to-face conversations with friends and family.

What changed after the Parkland shooting? Florida is a great state to be a gun owner. For years, it has been a laboratory of sorts for the National Rifle Association — it’s the state that invented the concealed-carry permit. Gun control proponents had started to resign themselves to the fact that they might never pass any laws. Then came Parkland. On today’s episode: • Patricia Mazzei, the Miami bureau chief for The New York Times. Background reading: • Gov. Rick Scott signed into law an array of gun limits, breaking with the N.R.A. Here’s a look at what’s in the new law.  • Florida’s pro-gun approach came under scrutiny after mass shootings in Orlando in 2016 and in Fort Lauderdale last year, but little changed.

                MARCH 12, 2018 Participating in political activism may be good for our teenagers, according to a new research report. The study, published in January in the journal Child Development, found that late adolescents and young adults who voted, volunteered or engaged in activism ultimately went further in school and had higher incomes than those who did not mobilize for political or social change. By tracking nearly 10,000 young people from a wide variety of ethnic, racial and economic backgrounds, researchers from Wake Forest School of Medicine, Fordham University and the University of Massachusetts measured the long-term implications of youth political and social engagement. Remarkably, they found that civic activity linked to better academic and financial outcomes regardless of early school performance and parental education levels, two factors that usually drive later success. Of course, correlation does not prove causation, but the study makes a case for the benefits of civic engagement.  In light of the findings, Parissa Ballard, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor in the department of family and community medicine at Wake Forest School of Medicine, said that “having meaningful opportunities to volunteer or be involved in activism may change how young people think about themselves or their possibilities for the future.”  The research is especially timely as American students consider whether to participate in the National School Walkout planned for Wednesday. In the aftermath of the killing of 17 students and teachers in Parkland, Fla., teenagers around the country are planning to leave their school buildings on Wednesday at 10 a.m. for 17 minutes, a demonstration meant to honor the victims and advocate for gun control. Taking part in a single event — whether this one or another that matches the child’s political leanings — may not, by itself, alter the trajectory of an adolescent’s development. But the study’s authors suggest that positive, lasting outcomes may result if organized civic engagement helps young people galvanize their belief in their personal efficacy, connect to empowering social networks or cultivate professional skills. Indeed, the teenage survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting are already making a difference: Gov. Rick Scott of Florida credited them with inspiring new gun control legislation he signed last week. For teenagers who intend to participate in the National School Walkout, this same study comes with an interesting caveat: Not all forms of political and social action confer equal benefits on young people. Though voting and volunteering both forecast lower levels of depression and smarter health choices down the line, activism does not.      “Activism,” Dr. Ballard said, “is usually a different social experience than other forms of civic engagement.” While casting ballots and serving others both enjoy broad cultural support and are reliably gratifying, “activism tends to be more controversial. Activism can be empowering. But it can also be experienced as difficult and stressful.” Indeed, the youth who engaged in activism — defined by the researchers as participating in a march or rally — enjoyed the positive benefits of greater educational attainment and larger incomes as they aged. But unlike those who only voted or volunteered, they also went on to engage in higher levels of risky health behaviors such as eating fast food, smoking cigarettes, using marijuana or binge drinking when they were between the ages of 24 and 32. The study’s authors propose two possible explanations for this. First, activists have, historically, often been members of counterculture groups where risk-taking may already have been the norm. Second, activists might become discouraged by the glacial pace of social change and turn to poor health habits to manage their frustration. “We can help young people reframe their expectations from big ideas to small wins,” Dr. Ballard said. “The expectation shouldn’t be changing federal policy right away, but getting news coverage and raising awareness.”  According to Dr. Ballard, adults can also help teenagers feel that their activism is effective by making it about connection: “connecting with others, connecting with a cause and connecting with what’s already going on.” While most teenagers are too young to express their opinions by voting, participating in rallies is a way to make their voices heard. Those who want to join the effort to end school shootings can look to the student-led March for Our Lives movement to learn about the global rallies scheduled for March 24 — a Saturday, so there is no conflict with classroom time. Of course the decision about whether to support or disapprove of a teenager’s activism is as personal as any in family life. Some adults will cheer on students who wish to participate in the walkout while others may oppose them or worry about the potential safety hazards, educational costs or disciplinary consequences of joining in. While some schools have threatened to suspend students who participate, legal scholars say students have the right to demonstrate unless they are disruptive. And dozens of colleges and universities said that any disciplinary actions against those participating in the protests would not affect their admissions decisions. Looking at the issue from a social science perspective, adults should nurture adolescents’ efforts to catalyze political and social change because civic engagement can help teenagers grow. America has a long history of benefiting from the activism of young people; it’s good to know that the young people usually benefit, too.

National,150," By KATIE BENNER, PATRICIA MAZZEI and ADAM GOLDMANFEB. 16, 2018 The F.B.I. received a tip last month from someone close to Nikolas Cruz that he owned a gun and had talked of committing a school shooting, the bureau revealed Friday, but it acknowledged that it had failed to investigate. The tipster, who called an F.B.I. hotline on Jan. 5, told the bureau that Mr. Cruz had a “desire to kill people, erratic behavior and disturbing social media posts,” the F.B.I. said. The information should have been assessed and forwarded to the Miami F.B.I. field office, the bureau said. But that never happened. On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz, 19, killed 17 students and teachers at his former high school in Parkland, Fla., law enforcement officials said. The tip about Mr. Cruz appeared to be the second in four months, after another person told the bureau about online comments from Mr. Cruz that he wanted to become “a professional school shooter.”  The news comes as the F.B.I. is under considerable pressure over its investigation into President Trump, with frequent attacks focused on the work of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel’s office overseeing the inquiry into Russian election interference.  In an unusually sharp public rebuke of his own agents, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Friday that the missed warnings had “tragic consequences” and that “the F.B.I. in conjunction with our state and local partners must act flawlessly to prevent all attacks. This is imperative, and we must do better.” Rick Scott, the Republican governor of Florida, said the bureau’s failure to act on the tip was “unacceptable” and called for the bureau’s director, Christopher A. Wray, to resign. “Seventeen innocent people are dead and acknowledging a mistake isn’t going to cut it,” Mr. Scott said in a statement. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, also asked for Congress to investigate. Mr. Wray said in a statement that he was “committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter, as well as reviewing our processes for responding to information that we receive from the public.” The F.B.I.’s admission opened up a new avenue of attack by conservatives who have questioned the impartiality of the bureau in its investigation into Russian intervention in the 2016 election. “Last September, FBI was sent a screenshot of a comment by nikolas cruz,” Ann Coulter, the conservative commentator, said in a post on Twitter. “Unfortunately, the FBI was busy running down Clinton campaign leads about a nonexistent Russian conspiracy with Trump.” It is not the first time that the F.B.I. has come under fire for being aware of a threat and failing to stop an attack. Congress criticized the bureau for not preventing the 2009 mass shooting at Fort Hood in Texas, in which the gunman was known to the F.B.I. The bureau also knew of one of the two brothers who carried out the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013. And Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in an Orlando, Fla., nightclub in 2016, had been investigated by the F.B.I. for months before the attack. That case was closed before the shooting occurred.  After those incidents, F.B.I. investigators compared themselves to hockey goalies, fielding a relentless barrage of pucks. Sometimes, they said, they could not keep things from making the net. “The public expects the F.B.I. to keep them safe, and in the overwhelming majority of the instances, the F.B.I. does just that,” said Lauren C. Anderson, a former top F.B.I. official in New York.      The F.B.I. was not the only law enforcement agency to be warned about Mr. Cruz. Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward County said Friday that his office had received about 20 calls regarding the suspected school gunman over the past few years. Sheriff Israel said on Friday that his office was still reviewing what it knew about Mr. Cruz before the shooting. The earliest known tip to the bureau came from a bail bondsman in Mississippi who told the F.B.I. last September about a worrying comment left on his YouTube channel from a “nikolas cruz” saying, “Im going to be a professional school shooter.” Agents from the F.B.I. field office in Jackson, Miss., looked into the comment but could not identify who had posted it from database and open-source searches, the F.B.I. said. The bureau was also reviewing what happened after the agents received the information. Law enforcement agencies have long asked people to call in, making the slogan “if you see something, say something” part of the public consciousness. Several politicians echoed those words again on Friday, noting that failures to act on tips about Mr. Cruz undermined years of effort to make the public part of the crime-fighting process. “We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ ” Mr. Scott said in a statement. “A courageous person did just that to the F.B.I. And the F.B.I. failed to act.”  The president and congressional leaders have accused the bureau of political bias in its handling of investigations of both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate. In December, Mr. Trump said the F.B.I.’s reputation was “in tatters” and the “worst in history.” This month, Mr. Trump said the F.B.I. and the Justice Department had been “a disgrace” and “should be ashamed” of their behavior. The deputy F.B.I. director, Andrew G. McCabe, was pushed out under pressure from the White House and Mr. Sessions. Some inside the building have feared that Mr. Wray would quit. The criticism of the F.B.I. has only increased after Mr. Mueller began to ensnare associates of Mr. Trump, including Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager, and Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser. Mr. Mueller released another indictment Friday accusing Russian nationals and companies of committing federal crimes while seeking to interfere in the United States political system. While Ms. Anderson, the former F.B.I. official, described the response to the tip on Mr. Cruz as a “tragic failure,” she also said that the past 18 months had been extremely difficult for the F.B.I. “At the end of day,” Sheriff Israel said, “make no mistake about it, America, the only one to blame for this killing is the killer himself.” A version of this article appears in print on February 17, 2018, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Warned About Suspect, F.B.I. Didn’t Act.   Order Reprints|  Today's Paper|Subscribe

National,151," Supported by By Patricia Mazzei James and Kimberly Snead, who took in Nikolas Cruz shortly after his mother died in November, knew he was depressed by her death. But they had no idea, Mr. Snead said Sunday, about the depth of Mr. Cruz’s troubles until the catastrophic rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. “We didn’t know he had such an evil past,” Mr. Snead said in a telephone interview, sounding weary and at a loss to explain what had happened. “We just didn’t know.” Mr. Snead said he and his wife let Mr. Cruz, the suspect in the rampage, stay in their Broward County home after the youngest of their three sons, who knew Mr. Cruz from Stoneman Douglas in Parkland, Fla., asked if he could live with them. They declined to provide their son’s first name or age. Mr. Cruz, 19, had been struggling following his mother’s sudden death of pneumonia on Nov. 1, and had been staying with a friend of his mother’s in neighboring Palm Beach County, Mr. Snead said. But there was “tension,” according to Mr. Snead, over money and over Mr. Cruz’s guns. He owned several, and they were unsecured. The friend of Mr. Cruz’s late mother had a toddler, Mr. Snead said, and did not want the child to be around the weapons. So the Sneads, who own guns themselves and keep them under lock and key, drove to Lantana to pick up Mr. Cruz and his belongings. On the way home, Mr. Snead said, they had Mr. Cruz buy a gun safe and bring it along in a truck rented from the Home Depot. Mr. Snead said he thought he had the only key to the safe. He did not learn until Wednesday, after 17 people were shot and killed at Stoneman Douglas with a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle, that Mr. Cruz had apparently kept a duplicate key, he said. “We knew he had troubles and a couple of issues, but I’ve raised three boys, and I thought we could help,” said Mr. Snead, a 48-year-old construction consultant. “It’s a very selfish thing he did — aside from the families he hurt, he hurt the family that tried to help him and give him a chance.” Asked what punishment Mr. Cruz might deserve, Mr. Snead said he did not know. The Sneads began speaking publicly about their relationship with Mr. Cruz on Saturday, in an interview with The Sun Sentinel of South Florida. Their attorney, Jim Lewis, said the couple has been cooperating with law enforcement since the shooting. The Sneads were “absolutely not” the people who called in a tip to the F.B.I. in January, warning that Mr. Cruz owned a gun and had a desire to kill, possibly at a school, Mr. Lewis said. The F.B.I. has acknowledged that it failed to investigate the tip. Mr. Snead and his wife knew Mr. Cruz was depressed because they asked him about it, Mr. Snead said. Mr. Cruz was often withdrawn, and when pressed about why, he’d say he was thinking about his mother. Mr. Cruz was not medicated, Mr. Snead said, but the Snead family had made plans for him to get help. “He was supposed to see a counselor this week,” Mr. Snead said. Still, the Sneads thought Mr. Cruz was doing better. “Things were good,” Mr. Snead said. He said he had pushed Mr. Cruz to take adult education classes — he’d had to leave Stoneman Douglas because of fighting, Mr. Cruz told them — and to get a job as a cashier at a Dollar Tree store. His time was taken up riding the bus to school and back home, and biking to and from work, Mr. Snead said. He said he was not aware of Mr. Cruz practicing shooting, at a gun range or anywhere else, in the time he was with the family. The Sneads knew Mr. Cruz had an Instagram account — their son followed Mr. Cruz on it — but have since realized that Mr. Cruz had a much wider, more troubling presence on social media, in which he apparently posted about guns and about being cruel toward animals. “We have animals” — two dogs and six cats, Mr. Snead said — “and he loved them, and they loved him.” The night before the shooting, Mr. Snead said he noticed nothing unusual. The family ate cheese and steak sandwiches for dinner — Mr. Cruz put a chocolate chip cookie on top of his — and then watched “Jeopardy” on television. Mr. Cruz went to bed early, as he often did, Mr. Snead said. According to Mr. Snead’s account, the next morning Mr. Cruz told Mr. Snead’s son, his former classmate, whom he’d met at JROTC in high school, that he wasn’t going to school because it was Valentine’s Day. In September 2016, his mother had told the state social services agency that Mr. Cruz had been acting out because he was upset over a breakup with a girl at Stoneman Douglas. Mr. Snead said he did not see Mr. Cruz on Wednesday morning, but assumed he was home with his wife. Ms. Snead, a registered nurse who works in a neonatal intensive care unit, planned to sleep during the day to rest before her night shift. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Snead said, after he had learned about the shooting from his son, a SWAT officer called him to ask about Mr. Cruz’s whereabouts. Mr. Snead said he didn’t know. He called his son to ask him. By then, the son had heard a description of the shooter — short with red hair, wearing black pants — and father and son reached the same conclusion: The police suspected Mr. Cruz. “I called the SWAT officer back and had him go to my house, because he was there with my wife, all morning, by themselves,” said Mr. Snead, who suddenly feared for her safety. Ms. Snead, it turned out, was asleep, alone and safe. The police arrested Mr. Cruz without incident along a residential street in the neighboring city of Coral Springs, about two miles from the school. They took him to the hospital to be treated for minor injuries, and then transported him to the Broward Sheriff’s Office headquarters. By then, the Sneads were there, waiting for their son, who was speaking to deputies. Mr. Snead said his wife turned angrily to Mr. Cruz, still wearing a hospital gown. “Really, Nik?” she asked. “Really?” He said Mr. Cruz replied that he was sorry.

National,152," Supported by By Patricia Mazzei MIAMI — Florida lawmakers gave final passage to a $400 million gun control and school safety bill on Wednesday in defiance of the National Rifle Association, which opposed the legislation’s firearm restrictions. The bipartisan vote came three weeks after a gunman killed 17 people in a rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The legislation, which passed the State Senate on Monday and now heads to the governor, would raise the minimum age to purchase any firearm to 21 from 18; impose a three-day waiting period on gun purchases; fund school police officers and mental health counselors; and allow local school districts and sheriffs to arm certain school personnel. It would also ban so-called bump stocks, which make guns fire faster, and give law enforcement more power to commit people deemed a threat. While the gun bill was the first to pass in the state in years, it fell short of the demands of many of the students and educators who have in recent weeks led a national call for stronger firearm restrictions. (Read our article about exactly what’s in the bill, and what’s not, here.) The emotional debate in the House, which lasted eight hours, culminated with powerful remarks from Representative Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who graduated from Stoneman Douglas High and told of attending the funerals of the dead. He broke down and needed a moment to compose himself when he shared that one of the victims, Jaime Guttenberg, was the daughter of his son’s preschool writing teacher. The chamber, which bustled with activity during almost every other speech, was rapt in attention. Vote for the bill, Mr. Moskowitz implored his colleagues. “This isn’t hard,” Mr. Moskowitz said. “Putting your kid in the ground is hard. This is easy.” “This may be the most consequential vote we ever take on this floor,” said Representative Shawn Harrison, Republican of Tampa. “Grown-ups protect our kids. It’s what we do. It’s our turn. Don’t let them down.” The legislation passed, with a vote of 67 to 50. Lawmakers rose, looked up into the public gallery and applauded Andrew Pollack, whose daughter, Meadow, was killed in the shooting. He sat through the debate and remained until the vote, even though it likely meant he missed his flight back home. Hours earlier, the grand jury in Broward County charged Nikolas Cruz, the suspect in the Feb. 14 massacre — one of the deadliest school shootings in American history — with 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. The indictment of Mr. Cruz, who has confessed to the killings, was essentially a formality, and the primary legal debate now centers on whether prosecutors should seek the death penalty. Mr. Cruz’s lawyers have offered a plea bargain — consecutive life sentences without parole — in a bid to avoid a trial and the threat of execution. “The only question is does he live or does he die?” said Howard Finkelstein, the Broward County public defender, whose office is representing Mr. Cruz. “The question for the community, and specifically the victims’ families — is it worth what will be a three-year trial odyssey followed by a 15-year appellate odyssey?” In the State Capitol on Wednesday afternoon, the provision to voluntarily arm trained school “guardians,” including librarians and school counselors, threatened to derail the legislation. But the families of all 17 people killed in Parkland sent House members a letter on Tuesday urging them to vote yes. “You must act to prevent mass murder from ever occurring again at any school,” they wrote. “This issue cannot wait. The moment to pass this bill is now.” On Thursday, several House Democrats cited the letter as the reason they would favor the proposal, even after the Democratic caucus took a formal position against it. The legislation prompted raw comments on the House floor and exposed a racial divide among Democrats: Black legislators warned their white counterparts that arming educators might result in discrimination against students of color. Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, has not said if he will sign the bill into law. His own proposal after the Parkland shooting did not envision arming school personnel or requiring a waiting period for all gun purchases. Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.

Washington,154," By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and ERICA L. GREENMARCH 7, 2018 WASHINGTON — Republican leaders, turning away from significant gun control legislation, have shifted instead toward measures that would beef up security at the nation’s schools, hoping the push will quell public uproar over the recent massacre in Parkland, Fla. But as students and parents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School continue their own organizing, the school safety strategy is unlikely to end the debate. Democrats and gun control advocates accused Republicans and the National Rifle Association of using school safety to divert attention from what they see as the real issue: the proliferation of guns that have been used in mass shootings at concerts, in movie theaters, on college campuses, in churches and at workplaces, as well as at public schools. “This time, the gun rights crowd messed with the wrong community, the wrong kids and the wrong dad,” said Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jaime, was killed at the school. He added, “I intend to be a part of breaking this gun lobby.” The Republican-controlled House plans to vote next week on the STOP School Violence Act, a bill that would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence.  The bill, drafted by Representative John Rutherford, a Republican and former sheriff from Jacksonville, Fla., is one of a flurry of bipartisan measures introduced in the House and the Senate devoted to school safety — without curbs on guns. In the Senate, a companion bill would also give schools money for physical improvements, such as installing metal detectors or bulletproof doors.  And Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate education committee, introduced his own school safety measure on Wednesday. His bill would allow 100,000 public schools to use federal dollars for school counselors, alarm systems, security cameras and crisis intervention training. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos threw her weight behind what she said was the only approach that could muster broad support after a brief but contentious visit on Wednesday to Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 students and faculty were gunned down on Valentine’s Day. “I think there’s an opportunity to take some practical steps that many, many people agree on and continue pushing forward on things that have broad support,” she said. But as the midterm election season begins, the school safety votes may only be an opening volley. “The Republicans would like to have the public think they’re doing something and have the N.R.A. think they’re doing nothing,” said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House. Gun control has long been one of the most divisive and contentious issues in Washington, and the rush to legislate on school safety reflects the difficulty of passing measures that have anything to do with guns. On Wednesday, students advocating gun safety legislation staged a sit-in outside the office of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, chanting “Enough is enough!” and “Not one more!” Eight were arrested, police said. But most gun safety proposals — including expanding background checks for gun purchases, raising the minimum age for buying rifles to 21 from 18, banning assault-style weapons like the AR-15 used by the gunman in Parkland and taking guns away from people deemed mentally unfit — appear to be going nowhere on Capitol Hill. President Trump’s mercurial statements have not helped. At a televised White House session, he appeared to back broad gun control legislation, only to muddy his position after an evening meeting with the N.R.A.’s chief lobbyist. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     One exception is the Fix NICS Act, a modest measure that would offer incentives to states and federal agencies to improve reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, for gun purchasers. The measure, which is backed by the N.R.A., has already passed the House and has broad bipartisan support in the Senate.  But even that legislation is facing a hurdle: Mr. McConnell cannot bring it up quickly for a vote because Senate rules require unanimous consent to do so, and at least one senator, Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, has objected. And while Mr. McConnell is a co-sponsor of the Senate’s version of the STOP School Violence Act, he has not said when the Senate will consider it. The Senate’s chief sponsor of the STOP School Violence Act, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said in an interview Wednesday that his aim was to focus on “special programs and special approaches toward making these schools safer and more acceptable to the families and kids.” As for Democrats who consider the measure insufficient, Mr. Hatch said: “That’s their motif every time. I mean, they know that if they can raise hell against guns and so forth, that that gives them a lot of publicity. But that doesn’t necessarily help us in our educational processes.” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and a co-sponsor of Mr. Hatch’s bill, said he did not want the Senate to lose sight of more far-reaching legislation that would address gun violence head-on. “That’s a useful bill, but it doesn’t have anything to do with gun laws,” Mr. Murphy said. “Anybody whose only solution to the school shooting epidemic is to make our schools fortresses doesn’t understand the root of this problem.” Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, also welcomed efforts to increase safety measures and resources, but she said legislators and Mr. Trump had used it deflect from the larger demands of the public, including students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, who had been in the forefront of gun control advocacy since the shooting. “The kids from Stoneman Douglas said, ‘Do certain common-sense, gun violence reduction measures — don’t change the subject,’” Ms. Weingarten said. While Republicans were talking about school safety, Senate Democrats on Thursday sought to keep the focus on guns. Senators Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, and Bill Nelson of Florida, convened a Democrats-only afternoon hearing to take testimony from those affected by gun violence.  Among the witnesses were Mr. Guttenberg and David Hogg, a 17-year-old Stoneman Douglas senior who has become a vocal national spokesman for gun control. In Parkland on Wednesday, Ms. DeVos was greeted less than enthusiastically by many students, who took to social media to complain that she did not have any substantive interactions with them. (Dwyane Wade, a basketball star for the Miami Heat who visited after Ms. DeVos, got a much warmer reception.) “I thought she would at least give us her ‘thoughts and prayers,’ but she refused to even meet/speak with students. I don’t understand the point of her being here,” tweeted Carly Novell, editor of the student newspaper, The Eagle Eye, which covered the secretary’s visit. Another student, Aly Sheehy, tweeted, “Do something unexpected: answer our questions.” 
            Do something unexpected: answer our questions. You came to our school just for publicity and avoided our questions for the 90 minutes you were actually here. How about you actually do your job? #neveragain #DoYourJob https://t.co/4Ts0INq0gR         The Education Department said that Ms. DeVos visited some students and teachers and laid a wreath, and that her visit was developed with the principal’s recommendations in mind to “provide minimal disruption on students’ first full day back in the school.” In her news conference, Ms. DeVos said she promised student journalists that she would return to meet with them.

Opinion,155," Supported by Opinion Compiled by Kathleen O’Brien Were you distracted by the full Nunberg; that Trumpy trade war (truly, the least bad option of the wars we could be facing, h/t Trevor Noah); or all that storm news? Here are some selections for your weekend reading, in case you missed them the first time around. From the Editorial Board: An alarming new study found that African-Americans and Latinos were far more likely to be denied conventional mortgages than whites even when income, loan size and other factors were taken into account. _____ Before he puts his name to a Supreme Court opinion that is expected to eviscerate public-sector unions, Justice Samuel Alito Jr. should visit West Virginia. _____ You don’t say. A three-part series addressed the history of nepotism and politics and provided close looks at the worrisome roles of both Jared Kushner  and Ivanka Trump. _____ From Op-Ed contributors: Four years ago, there were 15,000 people in Afghanistan working to remove unexploded bombs and grenades. Now there are only 5,000. International donors have scaled back their funding for these operations, but the need is still great, writes photographer Victor J. Blue. The unintentional casualties are civilians, often curious children, who pick up and step on old munitions. _____ Researchers analyzed the diffusion of all of the major true and false stories that spread on Twitter from its inception in 2006 to 2017. Disturbingly, they found that false stories spread significantly more than did true ones. Read a report from the researchers, featured in the “Gray Matter” column from Sunday Review. _____ Reconnecting A.I. with fields like cognitive science, psychology and even sociology will give us a far richer foundation on which to base the development of machine intelligence, writes Fei-Fei Li, the director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab. _____ Since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., officials have been calling for changes in how we handle people with mental health problems. Norman J. Ornstein wrote about his painful experience trying to get help for his son, advocating for both gun reform laws and better resources for the mental health system. _____ The North Korean regime never gives anything away for free, writes Victor Cha, an expert once under consideration to serve President Trump as ambassador to South Korea. _____ Jules Woodson says she was 17 when her youth pastor, Andy Savage, sexually assaulted her. In an Op-Ed video, she offers commentary while viewing Mr. Savage’s apology to his mega-congregation for what he calls a “sexual incident.” He received a standing ovation. _____ The remarkable successes of these directors — and the ways in which they’ve made their heritage part of more-universal movies — is a reminder of how ethnic and cultural diversity can enrich the movie industry. By Ioan Grillo, a contributing writer. _____ How, many wonder, could a Buddhist society — especially Buddhist monks! — have anything to do with something so monstrously violent as the ethnic cleansing now being perpetrated on Myanmar’s long-beleaguered Rohingya minority? Even if we suppose that most Buddhists, or members of any other religious group, really do hold beliefs that are pacifist and tolerant, we have no reason to expect that they will really be pacifist and tolerant. From The Stone series on philosophy. _____ And I will close with a message from a reader: “In some societies the elderly are revered. I don’t wish to be revered, only to be accepted as I am, for who I am, an 88-year-old woman who holds the wisdom of her years and looks it.” (Right there with you, Betty.)

NewsDesk,156," By THE NEW YORK TIMESMARCH 1, 2018 Criticism of the former Broward County sheriff’s deputy Scot Peterson has been intense since last week, when Sheriff Scott Israel revealed that Mr. Peterson remained outside taking cover while the shooting rampage unfolded inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killing 17. Mr. Peterson was the only armed sheriff’s deputy at the school when the shooting erupted. President Trump called Mr. Peterson a “coward” last week and on Monday said he himself would have rushed into the school to save the students “even if I didn’t have a weapon.” Mr. Peterson defended himself, saying in a statement released by his lawyer that he thought the gunfire originated from outside and reacted accordingly by waiting for the suspect there. Because school resource officers have a unique vantage point and unique statutory responsibilities to protect students, The New York Times believes they are an important voice in the debate over school gun violence.

U.S./Politics,157," By ALEXANDER BURNS and JULIE TURKEWITZMARCH 22, 2018 On Saturday, Rebecca Schneid plans to pull on her sneakers, sling a camera over her shoulder and march down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington with thousands of other students demanding an end to the gun violence that has cut through so many American communities. But to Ms. Schneid, a survivor of the school shooting that killed 17 people last month in Parkland, Fla., the march is just the beginning — a moment of political awakening, she hopes, that will put the nation on notice that young people plan to be a greater, more organized force than teenagers and college students in the past. “It’s going to look like millions and millions of people,” said Ms. Schneid, 16, who is the editor of the newspaper at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. “And it’s going to look scary to politicians.” With more than 800 student-led demonstrations planned in the United States and internationally, the organizers of the March for Our Lives are aiming for a generational show of strength by a diverse movement united in a conviction that adults have failed them.  Still, for all their fierce energy, these liberal-leaning activists have yet to be tested in the arena of electoral politics. They face a political system that is historically resistant to major change, and a Republican president and Congress with a strong base of support among much older voters, many of whom have more conservative views on guns.  A major moment will come in the 2018 midterm elections: Some students will be eligible to vote in November, and have vowed to make gun laws a central issue. Many more hope to organize networks and lay groundwork to vent their frustration — about pervasive school violence, and an unjust political system they view as enabling it — in the next vote for president in 2020. Ke’Shon Newman’s brother was shot nine times on Chicago’s South Side, where gun violence is a daily threat. Now, Ke’Shon is heading to Washington to march with high school students from Parkland, Fla. Whether the students of the post-Parkland movement become a disruptive force depends, in large part, on if they stay organized and register to vote. There is a big practical difference between tuning into politics and actually voting, political strategists and organizers say, and young people often vote at lower rates than older ones, especially in midterm elections. Page Gardner, president of Women’s Voices Women Vote Action Fund, a Democratic-aligned group that focuses on mobilizing young people, minorities and single women, said the big question was whether teenagers’ activism would translate into votes. The gun issue, she said, had become a focal point for young people who are “just fed up” with the way government works now. “They do think the system is rigged; this is just an example of it,” Ms. Gardner said of the gun issue. “They want to change it. Whether or not they register and vote to change it, is obviously the $64 million question.” The students have come of age during a time of political tumult — starting with President Trump’s election and erupting in a new and more focused way with last month’s school shooting. Having already reignited the political debate around guns, they believe they have the potential to bend the ideological and partisan lines of American politics more decisively as they join the electorate. Lane Murdock, 15, a high school student in Connecticut who is organizing a wave of school-walkout protests on April 20, said the combination of the gun massacres and Mr. Trump’s surprise win had jarred her out of political complacency. “We were raised to let the adults do the work,” said Ms. Murdock, who is traveling to Washington to join the march there. “When I was growing up and Obama was president, I didn’t pay much attention to politics.”  She called Mr. Trump’s election a turning point: “I think kids are frustrated that they really couldn’t have a say.” A number of the most prominent young activists from Parkland have already become familiar faces in Washington, and several arrived in the city early on Thursday to meet with students at Thurgood Marshall Academy, a school in Anacostia, a predominantly African-American neighborhood, to discuss gun violence. Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who has been meeting regularly with high school-age activists, said they stood out from other groups in their scorn for the political status quo. Mr. Murphy, who became a fierce advocate for gun control after the murder of 20 children in a 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., said he had urged the students to dig in for a long fight, on a historic scale — “like the Civil Rights movement or the anti-Vietnam War movement.” 
                Just over a month after the Parkland mass school shooting, organizers have planned hundreds of demonstrations calling for stricter gun laws.             “These kids are impatient,” said Mr. Murphy, who at 44 is one of the Senate’s youngest members. “This is a generation that is used to demanding immediate gratification, and they want it politically, too.” The March for Our Lives is likely to echo other mass demonstrations that have sprung up since Mr. Trump’s election. Like the Women’s March, it is to be anchored in Washington with speeches from students from around the country, and complemented by satellite rallies in cities and towns as large as Los Angeles and as small as Pinedale, Wyo. The National Park Service has approved a permit for the Washington march that estimates 500,000 people could attend, which would make it one of the most impressive displays of collective political will since the last presidential election — and the only one in which many or most of the participants have never been able to vote. Marchers like Madison Leal, however, are aching to start. Ms. Leal, 16, a student from Stoneman Douglas, said she would hold a sign at the march bearing 17 blood-red hands and the message: “How many more?” If elected officials do not act, Ms. Leal said, “I’m going to vote them out of office.” “And so is my entire generation,” she added. “And they’ll be sorry then.” Among some participants, the determination to defy an indifferent political system mingles with a persistent fear of disappointment. Dantrell Blake, 21, who was shot as a teenager in Chicago and plans to march in Washington, said he hopes to draw attention to gun violence in his hometown but knows that politicians could ignore the message. The mostly black victims of gun violence in Chicago, he said, had not drawn the attention of politicians the way the Parkland shooting did.  “It’s still rigged and they’re still going to do what they want,” Mr. Blake said of elected officials. Those competing impulses — the drive toward political confrontation, entwined with skepticism that government will accommodate them — may come to define these students as voters. As a group, they combine liberal social beliefs with an intensely wary view of the existing political and economic order, opinion polls have found. While young people are not uniformly Democratic-leaning or supportive of gun regulation, they are well to the left of the middle in their views. They have moved further toward Democrats since Mr. Trump’s election. Nearly three-fifths of millennial voters — a group slightly older than the high school-age marchers — identify as Democrats, according to a Pew Research Center study. That figure is much higher among women and minorities. Conservative supporters of gun rights have watched the teenagers’ mounting activism with concern and skepticism. They have organized competing rallies this weekend in places that include Salt Lake City and Helena, Mont., but Bryan Melchior, 45, a Utah gun-rights activist, said he sees the “gun community becoming more of a minority.” Mr. Melchior, who has been organizing a march in Salt Lake City, questioned the staying power of the Parkland movement. “It’s not going to change anything about our laws,” Mr. Melchior said of the march on Washington. “What I see is children that are just plain confused.” John Della Volpe, a pollster who studies young people’s political views for the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics, said the gun issue was part of a larger array of social views that define the next wave of voters. While young people are largely liberal, he said they were united chiefly by their dissatisfaction with the existing political system. “I think that’s what we’re seeing in this movement, in a raw form,” said Mr. Della Volpe, who met this week with some of the Stoneman Douglas activists.  And at least some of the students marching this weekend have already taken steps toward becoming voters. In Colorado, Rachel Hill, 16, a junior at Columbine High School, the site of a deadly 1999 attack, said she came from a politically mixed family but when she recently signed up to vote — under a Colorado law allowing teenagers to register early — she had identified herself as a Democrat. Ms. Hill said guns were part of the reason, but so were issues like immigration, abortion and gay and transgender rights. Ms. Hill, who led a walkout at her school to protest gun violence this month, said she plans to march at a rally at the Colorado capitol this weekend. And her aspirations have swerved toward politics for the long term, too: while she once dreamed of becoming an author or an archaeologist, Ms. Hill now hopes to be a member of Congress or an ambassador. “I thought, well, Trump,” she said. “If he can get into politics and if he can get elected, why can’t I?” An earlier version of a caption with this article mischaracterized the rally at Thurgood Marshall Academy. Alfonso Calderon and Alex Wind were waiting to join a rally for gun control, not against it. Alexander Burns reported from New York, and Julie Turkewitz from Denver.

Business,159," By TIFFANY HSUFEB. 27, 2018 Judith Pearson’s home in rural Minnesota is stocked with guns for hunting and recreational use, but that didn’t stop her from venting her frustration with the National Rifle Association after the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Ms. Pearson, a retired school principal, was irked by the group’s repeated efforts to preserve civilian access to semiautomatic rifles, like the AR-15 the gunman used to kill 17 students and school staff members. “BoycottNRA,” she wrote to her handful of Twitter followers on the day of the attack, becoming one of the first participants in what became a sprawling campaign to force corporate America to dissociate itself from the gun lobby. Across the country, in Los Angeles, Laura Mannino had a similar thought. Drain the NRA, an advocacy group she co-founded in October after a deadly shooting in Las Vegas, developed a public spreadsheet of businesses associated with the gun group. After the attack in Florida, Ms. Mannino helped organize a rally against gun violence in downtown Los Angeles that drew hundreds of people. “Everyone started, in parallel ways, but in tandem, to go after these companies,” she said. Since the Parkland massacre, a range of people and coalitions have converged on the nationwide battleground over gun control. That includes individuals trying to make a statement, activist organizations sensing a shift in sentiment, informal parents’ clubs, marketing executives, niche media groups, celebrities and shooting survivors.  Through an uncoordinated but simpatico collection of Twitter hashtags, retweeted lists, Facebook groups, online petitions and carefully orchestrated campaigns, the protest has pushed a major bank, several car rental companies, two airlines and other businesses to publicly cut ties with the N.R.A.  On Monday night, the insurance broker Lockton Affinity was the latest to join a list of more than a dozen companies that includes the insurance provider MetLife, the cybersecurity firm Symantec, and the automobile pricing and information website TrueCar. Unlike hundreds of other boycotts that barely registered with consumers, the current effort has “taken on significant symbolic purpose” and speed, said Lawrence B. Glickman, a history professor and boycotts expert at Cornell University. “This wasn’t a concerted thing — it just took off and took on a life of its own,” Professor Glickman said. “It’s stunning — nothing like this has ever happened before with the N.R.A. as far as I know.” The #BoycottNRA hashtag, the unofficial unifier of the movement, was trending on Twitter on Friday and appeared more than 10,000 times in a single four-hour period on Monday, according to the analytics service ExportTweet. The hashtag has floated around social media since before the Sandy Hook massacre in late 2012, usually bubbling up after high-profile mass shootings only to quickly fade after failing to inspire much action. After the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on Feb. 14, two dozen tweets mentioned the hashtag, followed by three dozen more the next day. But the calls for a boycott remained vague until last week, when lists of companies linked to the N.R.A. began tearing across social media. Posts from popular accounts were retweeted thousands of times.  ThinkProgress, a news website with a liberal bent, was among the first to spread the names, updating a list on Feb. 20 that it first published after the Sandy Hook shooting. It also published a report that the website for the N.R.A.’s official credit card was down. On Thursday, the First National Bank of Omaha, which issued the credit card, publicly confirmed its break from the N.R.A. “Then the floodgates were open,” said Judd Legum, who founded ThinkProgress. “Lots of people began moving very, very fast.” The pressure on companies to cut ties with the N.R.A. soon began sprouting up from various sources. Students who survived the Parkland shooting, who have become vocal proponents of gun control — and some of whom now have hundreds of thousands of social media followers — began pressuring specific companies to follow the bank’s lead. The massive asset manager BlackRock demanded information about the gun industry’s presence in investment portfolios. There were also calls for banks and payment processing companies to refuse firearms-related transactions.      Facebook posts and petitions from parents in Brooklyn, hiking enthusiasts and bike shops urged consumers and retailers like REI not to support CamelBak hydration packs and Bell helmets. Those brands are owned by Vista Outdoor, which also makes guns and ammunition. Celebrities including Alyssa Milano and Denis O’Hare began backing a push to stop Amazon and other streaming sites from supporting the NRATV online video channel. Unaware of the Hollywood campaign, Brad Chase, a communications consultant who in the past has worked with some of the brands that distanced themselves from the N.R.A., staged his own protest against Amazon after seeing screen grabs of the N.R.A.’s content streaming on its platforms. He and a longtime friend, whose son survived the Parkland shooting, initiated a petition on Thursday that asked people to “flood Amazon’s Legal Department with calls.” The pair hoped for 5,000 signatures. By Tuesday afternoon, they had more than 200,000. “We know we’re not going to change this epidemic of gun violence overnight, but this is one of those things people can do right now while we wait for the slow wheels of government to take action,” Mr. Chase said. 
                When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.             So far, Amazon has not issued any comment related to the N.R.A. Some companies have resisted calls to sever business relationships with the N.R.A. On Monday, FedEx said that while it disagreed with the N.R.A.’s policies on semiautomatic firearms, it would continue to offer discounts to the group’s members.  The N.R.A. itself has accused companies of “a shameful display of political and civic cowardice” and said that “in time, these brands will be replaced by others.” Since that statement on Saturday, the divisive debate has inspired some gun rights supporters to post about joining the N.R.A., using the hashtag #TweetYourNRAMembership. Many N.R.A. supporters have also vowed not to patronize the brands that ended relationships with the gun group. Still, the boycott effort — parts of it organic, parts of it carefully orchestrated — was an impressive show of force against the gun lobby. Shannon Watts, who founded the activist group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America after the Sandy Hook massacre, said her group had successfully persuaded hundreds of companies like Starbucks to block guns in their stores. The organization has more than 100,000 active volunteers it can quickly mobilize to create graphics, send email blasts and fan out over social media. But after Parkland, Moms Demand Action adopted hashtags that others had created and cheered on campaigns that others had organized. “The more the merrier — it’s been a cumulative effort of different groups within the same space, all putting pressure on the N.R.A.,” Ms. Watts said. “What this has shown is that it doesn’t have to be any one specific group or person — it’s more about the overall noise than any single hashtag.” Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.

Science,160," Supported by Trauma surgeons tell what it is really like to try to repair such devastating injuries. “Bones are exploded, soft tissue is absolutely destroyed,” one said. By Gina Kolata and C. J. Chivers Perhaps no one knows the devastating wounds inflicted by assault-style rifles better than the trauma surgeons who struggle to repair them. The doctors say they are haunted by their experiences confronting injuries so dire they struggle to find words to describe them.  At a high school in Parkland, Fla., 17 people were recently killed with just such a weapon — a semiautomatic AR-15. It was legal there for Nikolas Cruz, 19, the suspect in the shooting, to buy a civilian version of the military’s standard rifle, while he would have had to be 21 to buy a less powerful and accurate handgun. Many factors determine the severity of a wound, including a bullet’s mass, velocity and composition, and where it strikes. The AR-15, like the M4 and M16 rifles issued to American soldiers, shoots lightweight, high-speed bullets that can cause grievous bone and soft tissue wounds, in part by turning sideways, or “yawing,” when they hit a person. Surgeons say the weapons produce the same sort of horrific injuries seen on battlefields. Civilian owners of military-style weapons can also buy soft-nosed or hollow-point ammunition, often used for hunting, that lacks a full metal jacket and can expand and fragment on impact. Such bullets, which can cause wider wound channels, are proscribed in most military use. A radiologist at the hospital that treated victims of the Parkland attack wrote in The Atlantic about a surgeon there who “opened a young victim in the operating room and found only shreds of the organ that had been hit.” What follows are the recollections of five trauma surgeons. Three of them served in the military, and they emphasized that their opinions are their own and do not represent those of the armed forces. One has treated civilian victims of such weapons in American cities. And a pediatric surgeon treated victims of a Texas church shooting last year. “The tissue destruction is almost unimaginable. Bones are exploded, soft tissue is absolutely destroyed. The injuries to the chest or abdomen — it’s like a bomb went off.” If a bullet hits an arm or a leg, he said, the limb often hangs at an unnatural angle. Such victims can need a dozen surgeries over months. “Some eventually decide to undergo an amputation if there is severe pain in the limb and it is dysfunctional,” he said. “Bystanders are traumatized just seeing the victims. It’s awful, terrible. It’s just a ghastly thing to see.” Dr. Cannon recalled the aphorism by José Narosky, the Argentine writer: “In war, there are no unwounded soldiers.” His corollary: “In mass shootings, there are no unwounded victims.” What makes injuries from these rifles so deadly, he said, is that the bullets travel so fast. Those from an M16 or AR-15 can depart the muzzle at a velocity of more than 3,000 feet per second, while bullets from many common handguns move at less than half or a third that speed. The result: “The energy imparted to a human body by a high velocity weapon is exponentially greater” than that from a handgun. “You will see multiple organs shattered. The exit wounds can be a foot wide.” “I’ve seen people with entire quadrants of their abdomens destroyed.” Dr. Kerby will never forget the first victim of a high velocity bullet wound he treated when he was serving in the Southern Philippines 16 years ago. The soldier had been shot in the outer thigh. His first thought was that the wound did not look so bad. There was just a tiny hole where the bullet went in. Then he looked where the bullet had exited. The man’s inner thigh, he said, “was completely blown out.” Later he came to expect the telltale pattern. “You will typically see a small penetrating wound. Then you roll the patient over and you see a huge exit wound.” The high energy bullet creates a blast wave around the bullet. And the yaw can contribute to the larger exit wound. Striking bone can also cause bone fragments that radiate outward, cutting tissue in each fragment’s path.  “Then the bullet starts tumbling, causing more and more destruction.” Even a bullet that misses bone can result in surprising damage; as the blast wave travels through the body, it pushes tissues and organs aside in a temporary cavity larger than the bullet itself. They bounce back once the bullet passes. Organs are damaged, blood vessels rip and many victims bleed to death before they reach a hospital. Those who survive long enough are whisked to operating rooms, but often the injuries cannot be repaired. “If they are shot in the torso, there often is not a whole lot we can do,” he said. With a handgun, the bullets mostly damage tissues and organs in their direct path. Eventually, the bullets may be slowed and stopped by the body. Emergency surgery often can save handgun victims. Dr. Kerby said it used to be that surgeons like him saw victims of assault rifle shootings only in the military. No more. Now, though the wounds are still rare on the streets of Birmingham, he operates on occasional victims — that is, those who survive long enough to reach the hospital. “These weapons are meant to kill people,” he said. Dr. Gupta never served in the military, but he has treated victims of assault-style weapons in New York and Baltimore. Attacks using AR-15-style weapons are still rare, he emphasized. He sees mostly handgun wounds and some from shotguns. “A single wound from a handgun follows a narrow path, pretty much the direct path the bullet took,” Dr. Gupta said. “It is easier to figure out what is injured.” Even a bullet wound to the heart can be repaired, he said, if the patient survives long enough to get to the hospital. But like other trauma surgeons, Dr. Gupta has been struck by the devastation modern rifle bullets produce. The wide swath of damage makes it difficult to determine the extent of the injuries, and even more difficult to repair them. And if the bullet strikes the heart or other major organ, the victim usually cannot be saved. “What we hear about in the news are the mass shootings,” Dr. Gupta said. The victims of military-style weapons that Dr. Gupta has treated in American cities are the silent victims. Nine of the victims made it to her hospital that day. Four were children, one of whom died. Dr. Liao was initially clinical in describing the wounds during an interview. “Muscles and skin and fat surrounding skin can be sheared off. We saw holes in intestines and bladders.” Asked about the emotional impact of the killings, she said she thought she had moved on. Then came the Parkland shootings, and the horror came flooding back.

Opinion,161," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Norman J. Ornstein Ever since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., law enforcement and other officials have been calling for changes in the Baker Act, a Florida law that allows involuntary commitment for 72 hours of people who are an imminent danger to themselves or others. If the Baker Act had been easier to deploy, they think, Nikolas Cruz, the accused shooter, would have been taken and treated before his horrible act. However this law may be reformed, it will never be able to get people with serious mental illness the treatment they need. I know something about the Baker Act. About halfway through my son Matthew’s decade-long struggle with serious mental illness, my wife and I invoked the Baker Act against him. This kind, brilliant, thoughtful young man, who experienced the sudden onset of mental illness at age 24, was living in a small condominium we owned near Sarasota, Fla. One day the manager called us with alarming allegations about his behavior and insisted that Matthew was in immediate danger. In a panic, we flew to Sarasota, went to the courthouse and filled out the forms to invoke the Baker Act. It was surprisingly easy. When we got to the condo, Matthew was already gone. We later learned what had happened next. He had just emerged from the shower when police officers cuffed him — without letting him dress or pick up his cellphone, or even explaining what was happening. He was transported to a county mental health facility. We followed, desperate to see our son. But the staff members wouldn’t let us in. In fact, they said privacy rules meant that they could not even confirm that he was there. Worst of all, we found out we had been duped. The condo manager who had called us had concocted the story as a pretext to get our son off the property. Because Matthew had long hair and a beard, smoked and tended to wander on the beach at 3 a.m., the manager thought he might scare away those renting other units — and he just wanted Matthew out. The Baker Act allows 72 hours of involuntary observation to see whether someone is in fact an imminent danger to himself or others. Matthew was not, and after three awful days, he was put in a taxi and sent home. We were not informed when he was released. Our relationship with our son was deeply damaged by this incident, making any further efforts by us to help him infinitely more difficult. It did nothing to help him deal with his condition and only increased his sense of being stigmatized and hounded. He moved out of Florida and died in an accident at age 34. That episode, and our 10-year journey, taught us that the entire mental health system is broken. First, the standard of “imminent danger to oneself or others,” which is sufficient to order a short period of involuntary commitment in many states, is ludicrous and often counterproductive. It results both in mistakes like ours and in worse problems at the other end of the spectrum, when it requires the release of individuals who are truly dangerous but who don’t meet the “imminent” standard. Even if an individual is confirmed to be dangerous, the Baker Act allows him or her to be held for 90 days; a judicial hearing can then extend the commitment by another 90 days — far from enough time to provide any meaningful or sustained treatment. Second, a system that keeps loved ones from any involvement in the treatment of people with serious mental illness, especially those who do not know or believe they are ill, is cruel and ineffective. Finally, a vast majority of those with serious mental illness are not dangerous. We need a way to treat them, while also recognizing that failure to treat the small share who might be violent can lead to tragedies like suicide and murder. The Baker Act is not going to solve these problems. We have far too few beds in mental health facilities, so most people who have a serious illness and are picked up for offenses like vagrancy from homelessness or drug possession (many people with mental illness self-medicate with drugs) end up in jails, where they lack treatment and almost invariably deteriorate. Common-sense reforms, like ending a foolish Medicaid restriction that cuts off money for some larger mental health facilities, would help. But what is really required is a comprehensive treatment framework and the money to pay for it. Ironically, a model exists near Parkland. Steve Leifman, a judge in Miami-Dade County, created a system in which those with serious mental illness who are charged with misdemeanors or nonviolent felonies are given a choice of going to trial or accepting an outpatient treatment plan, with a place to live and care from medical professionals and counselors. He has also provided crisis intervention and sensitivity training to police officers. Instead of languishing in jail, many of the beneficiaries are now getting good jobs and participating productively in their community. He has saved lives — and money. States should use this as a model for all outpatient treatment, not just for those who enter the criminal justice system. There must be safeguards to protect people’s civil liberties, but families and mental health professionals should be able to petition a court to order someone to accept a comprehensive treatment plan if that person has gone untreated and is unaware that he or she has a serious mental illness and would otherwise be homeless, cycling in and out of jail or worse. Instead, we are taking tiny steps forward, and giant steps back. Gov. Rick Scott of Florida has proposed spending $450 million to station guards in every school, with more funding for bulletproof windows, steel doors and so on, while adding a paltry $50 million for mental health care. Even as President Trump calls for bringing back “mental institutions,” his budget slashes Medicaid. Many Republicans in the meantime are demanding drug testing and work requirements for Medicaid recipients, which would cause many mentally ill people to lose their coverage — meaning no treatment and no housing. To reduce the incidence of mass murders — and suicides — we have to reform the gun laws. Clearly, people with serious mental illness should not be able to own guns (and no civilians should be able to buy weapons of war like AR-15s). The background-check system is a farce. States need to adopt “red-flag” laws, which allow police officers and family members to petition a court to bar dangerous individuals from possessing guns. But until we devote the needed resources to making the mental health system work, we will continue to have unnecessary tragedies. Locking people up for three days is no solution. Norman J.

National,162," By JONAH ENGEL BROMWICHFEB. 22, 2018 A student in Pennsylvania is under investigation after he called the police on Wednesday to report that he had forced open a window and climbed into a classroom at his school, all while he was asleep. Even though the student had reported himself to the authorities, the school, Wendover Middle School in Hempfield Township, was closed on Wednesday and swept for weapons, underscoring the seriousness with which potential threats to schools have been treated since the shooting at a high school last week in Parkland, Fla. The student moved a screen out of the way before climbing through the window, the authorities said. The police did not name the sleepwalker, and the break-in remained under investigation. In a radio interview on Thursday, the boy’s father, speaking anonymously, said that his son had walked the four and half miles to the school, sleeping the whole time.  “And he’s scared of the dark,” the father said. “He won’t even go outside my house at night.”  The sleepwalker, who had a backpack with him, was found in the classroom at about 2:30 a.m. Trooper Steve Limani of the Pennsylvania State Police said it would be a mischaracterization to say that he was “apprehended.” Mr. Limani seemed unsure of how to describe the event. He said that the student had not been arrested and that he had a history of sleepwalking. The family had guns at the house, but none of the weapons were missing, the police said. A different student at the school, about 45 minutes southeast of Pittsburgh, was arrested several days earlier after threatening a classmate of his and “possibly other students,” Mr. Limani said. “I’m sure we’re not the only police department going through this,” Mr. Limani said, adding that he believed that children making verbal threats were inspired by Nikolas Cruz, the teenager who confessed to killing 17 people in Parkland.      Evidence from around the country bears Mr. Limani’s observation out, as aftershocks have continued to affect schools in the week since the attack. At least two dozen students have been arrested after making threats toward schools or classmates. Some of those arrested have been charged, like a student in Hot Springs, Ark., who was charged with making terroristic threats in the first degree. But there have also been a fair share of false alarms. Armstrong Middle School in Starkville, Miss., was moved to clarify that it was not on lockdown on Feb. 15, the day after the Parkland shooting. “All students and staff are safe and secure,” the district told a local reporter, MaryCarroll Sullivan. The district clarified that a post an adult had made on social media had “created a frenzy of misinformation that is fueling untruths.” Dr. Mary Ellen O’Toole, a former F.B.I. profiler, said that copycat incidents have followed school shootings since before the 1999 Columbine massacre in Colorado, in which 12 students and one teacher were killed.  “Every time we had one of these events, we had these threats,” she said, attributing it to the Werther effect, a phenomenon in which news of a suicide can influence those at risk of self-harm to kill themselves. Dr. O’Toole said that teams dedicated to assessing threats from students had become commonplace at universities and in school districts nationwide, and that it could be difficult to ascertain the seriousness of any given threat until it was thoroughly investigated. “There’s no magical formula to say, well, this one is serious and this one isn’t,” she said. “It’s like opening a book to page 50. You don’t know what’s on pages one through 49, or 51 to 100. Behavior could be innocuous or terribly threatening.” Follow Jonah Bromwich on Twitter: @Jonesieman.  ",2018-02-22,0.04075622,Thursday
Washington,163," By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVISFEB. 21, 2018 Andrew Pollack, who lost his daughter in the Florida shooting, was a guest at a listening session at the White House. WASHINGTON — An anguished father mourning his 18-year-old daughter vented his anger and pleaded for safer schools. A fear-stricken student who watched classmates die last week wept openly as he called for banning assault weapons. A mother who lost her 6-year-old son in a school shooting just over five years ago warned that more parents would lose their children if President Trump did not act, adding, “Don’t let that happen on your watch.” One by one at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, survivors of school shootings and family members of victims shared their stories and their calls to action. The extraordinary public exchange with the president gave voice to an intensely emotional debate over how to respond to the latest gun massacre in an American school.  A week after a gunman opened fire with an AR-15-style assault rifle at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killing 17 people and prompting a rash of student-driven lobbying for new gun restrictions, Mr. Trump met for more than an hour with grieving people in search of solutions. News cameras captured the unusual listening session, revealing an emotional give-and-take between a president and private citizens that is typically shielded from public view.  Mr. Trump used the event to pitch his own ideas about how to prevent such debacles in the future, polling the group about whether they supported allowing teachers and other school employees to carry concealed weapons, an idea he said could have halted the carnage in Parkland. “That coach was very brave, saved a lot of lives, I suspect,” Mr. Trump said, apparently referring to Aaron Feis, a coach at Stoneman Douglas who reportedly died using his body as a shield to protect students. “But if he had a firearm, he wouldn’t have had to run, he would have shot and that would have been the end of it.” At a listening session with grieving parents and school-shooting victims, including students from Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, President Trump suggested teachers should be allowed to carry firearms. Mr. Trump said he would press to strengthen background checks for people buying guns and press for enhanced mental health measures. “We’re going to go very strongly into age — age of purchase,” he added, appearing to refer to a proposal to set an age threshold for buying certain weapons, including the AR-15. But in a session that began as a subdued conversation and sometimes descended into tears and shouting, policy proposals were overshadowed by raw expressions of fear, anger and sorrow. “We’re here because my daughter has no voice — she was murdered last week, and she was taken from us, shot nine times,” said Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was one of the 17 killed in Parkland. “How many schools, how many children have to get shot? It stops here, with this administration and me, because I’m not going to sleep until it’s fixed.” Most of the students and parents invited from the Florida school appeared to support Mr. Trump, many of them prefacing their comments with praise for his leadership. But even fans of the president vented anger and desperation, laying the challenge of responding to the tragedy at his feet. “It should have been one school shooting, and we should have fixed it — and I’m pissed,” said Mr. Pollack, the only parent of a child killed in Parkland who was at the session, raising his voice as he looked at Mr. Trump. “Because my daughter, I’m not going to see again.”  Samuel Zeif, 18, told of texting his parents and brothers from the second floor of Stoneman Douglas, believing that he would be killed, and he dissolved into tears as he begged the president, “Let’s never let this happen again — please, please.” “I don’t understand why I can still go in a store and buy a weapon of war, an A-R,” Mr. Zeif said, referring to the AR-15 rifle. “How is it that easy to buy this type of weapon? How do we not stop this after Columbine, after Sandy Hook? I’m sitting with a mother who lost her son. It’s still happening.” Mr. Trump, who has often struggled to express empathy in the face of tragedy, appeared moved by the personal stories, even as he asked repeatedly whether anyone in the ornate room at the White House knew how such horrors could be prevented. “I know you’ve been through a lot — most of you have been through a lot more than you ever thought possible,” Mr. Trump said, seated in a circle with students and parents. “All I can say is that we’re fighting hard for you, and we will not stop.” “I grieve for you,” Mr. Trump added. “To me, there could be nothing worse than what you’ve gone through.” During the session, Mr. Trump held a card that appeared to remind him of the basics of compassion when dealing with grieving survivors. “What would you most want me to know about your experience?” read one handwritten note on the card, captured in photographs of the event. “I hear you,” read another. Mr. Pollack said he did not favor adopting new gun restrictions, but pleaded for Democrats and Republicans to come together to create new school safety measures. “It’s not about gun laws right now — that’s another fight, another battle,” he said. “We need our children safe.”  Yet the subtext of the discussion was a contentious debate over gun restrictions and an all-too-familiar cycle of outrage, activism and promises of action, and then the inevitable inertia of Washington because of the opposition by the National Rifle Association and its allies. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     Mr. Trump, a strident defender of gun rights who ran for office with the strong backing of the N.R.A., has come under immense pressure to endorse new gun limits after the Parkland massacre. The mass shooting has prompted a wave of youth activism that has reverberated from South Florida to Washington, where hundreds of students gathered outside the White House gates on Wednesday before the listening session, chanting, “Enough is enough!” and, “Hands up! — Don’t shoot!” Mark Barden, who lost his 7-year-old son Daniel at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, said it was futile to believe Congress would act on new policies. “We tried this legislative approach,” said Mr. Barden, a founder and managing director of Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit advocacy group created after the massacre. “I’ve been in this building before many times, wringing our hands, pleading with legislators — ‘What can we do?’ — until we finally said we have to go home and do this ourselves.” He and Nicole Hockley, who lost her 6-year-old son Dylan at Sandy Hook, pressed Mr. Trump to consider prevention programs that train schools and educators to identify students in crisis and intervene before they attempt to harm themselves or others. “Rather than arm them with a firearm,” Ms. Hockley said of teachers, “I would rather arm them with the knowledge of how to prevent these acts from happening in the first place.” One of Mr. Pollack’s sons, Hunter, said he would prefer that educators carried weapons, arguing that more firearms on campus would lead to safer schools. Yet it was the emotional appeals that appeared to have more influence on Mr. Trump. Mr. Barden pulled out a photograph of his son showing a gaptoothed grin. Mr. Pollack spoke movingly of “my beautiful daughter I’m never going to see again.” Ms. Hockley implored the president not to allow another massacre of children on his watch, saying: “Consider your own children. You don’t want to be me — no parent does.”  As he ended the session, Mr. Trump promised their stories would not go unheard or unaddressed. “Thank you for pouring out your hearts,” he said. “Because the world is watching, and we’re going to come up with a solution.” A version of this article appears in print on February 22, 2018, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: In Halls of Power, Gun Survivors Urge Action.

Business,164," By TIFFANY HSUFEB. 25, 2018 TAMPA, Fla. — The lines stretched out the door this weekend at a gun show in Tampa, Fla., as thousands of potential buyers and the merely curious waited for their turn to browse booths stocked with the latest firearms, ammunition, customizable holsters and patriotic paraphernalia. Inside, parents pushed their babies in strollers past T-shirts emblazoned with phrases like “I study triggernometry.” A nonprofit group in one booth was raffling off a rifle to raise money to battle child and animal abuse. On large signs by the entrance, the National Rifle Association was offering refunds on the $11 admission if shoppers signed up for a membership. Outside, Girl Scouts were selling cookies. But the deadly mass shooting a couple of hundred miles away at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School cast its shadow. Both buyers and sellers were talking about the attack, as well as about the divisive debate that it had recently reignited. And there, on many tables, were racks of AR-15s — variations of the hugely popular semiautomatic rifle used by the 19-year-old Parkland gunman.  Several sellers said they were on track to double their normal sales for a weekend. “It’s sad to say, but whenever there’s a shooting, business only goes up because people are afraid of losing their right to own a certain weapon,” said Quaidman Woody, who was running a booth with his father, a sales representative for CrossHeirs. “So even if they don’t need another AR, they’ll buy another AR or pieces of it.”  In the packed exhibition hall, attitudes toward firearms laws were far from monolithic. Kathy Fox, who was helping at a booth with collectible Winchester rifles exhibited upright on a turntable, said she was pleased that Representative Brian Mast, a Republican and Army veteran, who represents her district in Florida, had called for a ban on future sales of tactical rifles. But she added that “there’s nothing wrong with guns” and that “there are nuts everywhere.” “Everyone has a different perspective, a different outlook,” she said of her fellow show participants. “It’s not that they’re bad people.” The gun show was one of more than 40 around the country scheduled for this past weekend. Most were in the Midwest and South. A common refrain among buyers and sellers at the Tampa show was not to blame guns in the Parkland shooting. Instead, they argued, crack down on violent video games. Fix broken families. Bolster mental health screenings. Rely less on government protection. “We’ve lost our perspective on what’s really happening,” said Scott Rollf, who owns a company called 22mods4all. He said customer concerns about potential legal limits on guns had perked up sales after a decline in demand in recent months led him to reduce prices. Mr. Rollf said he approved of Gov. Rick Scott’s proposal to raise the minimum age in Florida to buy firearms to 21 from 18. He was also fine with banning so-called bump stocks and other attachments that increase firing speeds, which he views as “useless” for hunting and unsafe in other applications. Last week, President Trump, an avowed “champion” of gun owners, ordered the Justice Department to issue regulations on bump stocks, which were used in the massacre of concertgoers in Las Vegas last October.  Calls for gun control have intensified since the Parkland shooting, propelled by the students who survived the Feb. 14 attack and by a fast-moving boycott effort that led major companies like United Airlines and the Enterprise car rental business to cut ties with the N.R.A. Florida Gun Shows, which organized the Tampa event, canceled its Fort Lauderdale gathering next month at the request of Mayor Jack Seiler. Norman Carolino, who was selling body armor at the Tampa show, called the scrapped plans a disservice to people looking for protection. He said most of his sales on Saturday were to teachers, school administrators and “parents who are scared to death.” “I’m wiped out of everything,” he said. “There are parents in here who’ve never seen the inside of a gun show.” Juanita Stafford and her husband, Tommy, bought bullet-resistant backpack plates for their eight school-age grandchildren in Florida and Alabama. They received a bulk discount off the $199 price a pad. “We don’t want to be the people going to funerals and saying coulda, woulda, shoulda,” she said. “We’re putting our money where our mouth is.” Nearby, rows of handguns sat on cardboard boxes, in glass cases and nestled in velvet-lined cradles. Some sellers wandered the floor carrying signs advertising personal firearms, like a Colt AR-15 SP-1 rifle, for sale in private transactions, which do not require background checks.  Mr. Woody estimated that only 10 percent of gun show shoppers were firearms aficionados. The rest, he said, are either newcomers or dabblers. Many buyers have never purchased an AR-15 before, he said. Mr. Woody, an 18-year-old college freshman in a Christ the Redeemer shirt and cargo shorts, said he supported spending to improve campus safety and incentives for teachers to keep firearms within reach but secured. But he decried efforts to raise the minimum age to buy semiautomatic firearms. “There’s a big stigma around the AR-15,” Mr. Woody said. “But say they ban it — if the person knows what they’re doing, they’re just going to buy a different gun that shoots the same caliber and does the same thing but doesn’t get included in the ban because it doesn’t look tactical.” Even before the Parkland shooting, the gun industry was distressed. Thriving demand for firearms after the Sandy Hook attack in 2012 and during President Barack Obama’s administration caused new gun companies to swarm the market. But many of those businesses have since scaled back or folded as enthusiasts became less nervous about potential gun legislation and less anxious to stock up. Remington, one of the oldest gun makers in the country, said it was preparing to declare bankruptcy. American Outdoor Brands, whose Smith & Wesson brand was well represented at the show, has complained about “challenging market conditions.” Show participants said the financial pressure on the industry and the renewed public attention on guns would make companies especially eager to bolster quality and safety — especially in military towns like Tampa and other markets with avid, discerning firearms customers. Lindsay Potter, who, with her husband, Garrett, was operating a booth for their company, Special Ops Tactical, described herself as a “big supporter” of the N.R.A. She also said she welcomed strict background checks, believed that sellers should use their discretion to refuse sales and appreciated audits by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “We are under a lot of scrutiny,” she said. “And we should be.” Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.

                            DEALBOOK
                        MARCH 5, 2018 Over the past several weeks, there has been a lot of talk about investors ridding themselves of their shares in gun manufacturers and retailers after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. A number of public pension funds, like those in the state of Connecticut, have discussed the prospect of selling their shares. But here’s a counterintuitive idea: Use those stakes in the gun industry to encourage reforms. That’s what Larry Fink, chairman of BlackRock, the largest investor in the world, has the opportunity to do — if he is true to his word about holding companies accountable to “not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.” Mr. Fink repeated those words to me last month when I wrote a column about a letter he delivered to the world’s top executives in January, pressing them on social responsibility. Well, it turns out that Mr. Fink’s firm is one of the largest owners of gun manufacturers in the country. It wasn’t a conscious choice by BlackRock; because BlackRock is the largest index investor in the world and gun makers are included in various indexes, it owns large stakes in American Outdoor Brands; Vista Outdoor; and Sturm, Ruger by default. None of its actively managed funds — in which a manager actually decides to make investments in a particular company — has a stake in a gun manufacturer.  So what can BlackRock reasonably do? In a three-page paper issued Friday, the firm said “we have reached out to the major publicly traded civilian firearms manufacturers and retailers to engage in a discussion of their business practices.”  BlackRock says, for example, that it is asking gun makers questions like, “What steps do you take to support the safe and responsible use of your products?” and “How do you assess the financial, reputational and litigation risk” of your product lines? Mr. Fink deserves credit for pressing companies on social responsibility. But while engagement is good, there is real opportunity to do much more. BlackRock could make a reasonable argument that, between customer blowback and the potential for regulatory pressure, it is in the financial interests of everyone in the gun manufacturing and retail chain to reform themselves voluntarily. And if companies don’t take such steps, BlackRock — and everyone else who owns shares in these companies — could vote to oust their boards of directors. BlackRock has enormous influence over both gun makers and retailers. It could pressure them to raise the minimum age for buying AR-15-style rifles to 25 years old, and impose strict screening and background checks that go far beyond what is required by law. BlackRock could even push gun makers to stop producing such weapons altogether. It could also recommend that gun manufacturers and retailers make and sell “smart guns” employing technology that allows only the registered owner to use it; that could prevent children from using guns and reduce deaths and injuries related to stolen firearms. (No retailer has ever sold a “smart gun” in the country, in part because of pressure from the gun industry and lobby. Where are you Dick’s and Walmart?) At the moment, BlackRock seems to be doing a lighter-touch version of what I described. In its statement on Friday it made a veiled threat: “Based on our engagement conversations and our long-term view of the company, we may vote against specific directors or we may vote against management on shareholder proposals.”      BlackRock is a fiduciary so it must make a financial case for such changes — showing that taking those steps would turn out to be more profitable in the end. It can’t simply press for such action on moral grounds. But the evidence is already clear: Remington, America’s oldest gun company, which since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 has struggled to access the capital markets or find any buyer, filed for bankruptcy protection just two days before the shooting in Parkland. And retailers are already forcing the issue: Companies like Dick’s, Walmart and Kroger have raised the age for gun purchases on their own.  Not to mention that consumer boycotts could hurt the bottom line of both gunmakers and retailers that don’t take action on their own. Gunmakers may want to focus more on what’s playing out with REI. The outdoor retailer doesn’t sell guns, but it said it would stop selling Camelbak water pouches and Giro helmets because they are made by Vista Outdoor, which does sell guns. REI was direct in stating that it was holding Vista accountable for its approach. “This morning we learned that Vista does not plan to make a public statement that outlines a clear plan of action,’’ it said in a statement last week. “As a result, we have decided to place a hold on future orders of products that Vista sells through REI while we assess how Vista proceeds.” It is not just BlackRock that has an opportunity to use its ownership clout. Goldman Sachs, for example, took a stake in Cabela’s, the outdoor and firearms retailer — which sells AR-15’s — as part of a private equity deal it financed last year when Bass Pro Shops acquired Cabela’s. Why Goldman Sachs, which has had its own share of bad publicity over the years and always talks about being in the business of making sound judgments, would actively participate in a deal for a major gun retailer is baffling. (Several Goldman employees told me there has been a lot of conversations about how embarrassing it is that the firm was involved in the transaction.) But now that Goldman is involved, it has a chance to use whatever influence it can muster to bring about reforms. The bank says it has been in touch with Cabela’s management so we’ll have to see what happens next. Others are also surveying the landscape. “We will be engaging with weapons manufacturers and distributors to seek greater transparency from them on the ways that they will support the safe and responsible use of their products,” State Street, the financial services firm, said in a statement. Vanguard is talking to manufacturers, but it has not taken a public stance. For gun-control advocates, any business that invests in gun makers or retailers may seem an anathema. But given the pressure already coming from the outside, the best chance for real change may end up coming from those very same investors.

Business,166," By JONAH ENGEL BROMWICHMARCH 3, 2018 YouTube this week cracked down on the videos of some prominent far-right actors and conspiracy theorists, continuing an effort that has become more visible since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last month caused a torrent of misinformation to be featured prominently on the site. A week after the shooting, many of the videos on YouTube’s “Trending” list contained misinformation about the teenage survivors of the shooting. The top video on the list for some time falsely claimed that a student at the school, David Hogg, was a paid actor. That video and others like it led to intense criticism of the site. Since then, many prominent right-wing personalities have reported that YouTube has issued them strikes, which the site uses to enforce its community guidelines. If a channel receives three strikes within three months, YouTube terminates it. The company’s guidelines prohibit “videos that contain nudity or sexual content, violent or graphic content, harmful or dangerous content, hateful content, threats, spam, misleading metadata, or scams.”  Mike Cernovich, the right-wing agitator and conspiracy theorist, said Wednesday that his channel, which has more than 66,000 subscribers, had been given a strike. (Mr. Cernovich said Saturday that YouTube had reversed the strike and that the video that had been banned was again available on the site.)  Infowars, the conspiracy theory outlet headed by Alex Jones, said Tuesday that it had received a second strike in two weeks, both for videos about the Parkland shooting. (Infowars, which has more than 2.2 million YouTube subscribers, later said the second strike had been removed.) Infowars’ Washington bureau chief, Jerome Corsi, said on Twitter that his YouTube channel had been terminated without notice or explanation. News outlets including The Outline and Breitbart have pointed to more than a dozen other right-wing or right-leaning accounts that have been disciplined, claiming they have either received strikes or been banned outright in the past several weeks. They include the violent neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen (banned for hate speech) and the YouTube star Carl Benjamin, known by his username Sargon of Akkad, who criticizes feminism and identity politics. Mr. Benjamin posted a screenshot on Facebook on Thursday that said he had been locked out of his Google account because “it looked like it was being used in a way that violated Google’s policies.” YouTube said it was not aware of any prominent accounts that had falsely reported strikes, though it did say that Mr. Benjamin had violated its policy on  copyright infringement. YouTube denied that the deletions and other actions were ideologically driven. It said accounts that had been disciplined or banned were only the most prominent, and vocal, of many across the ideological spectrum who had seen their videos taken down for violating the site’s rules. But critics said YouTube was reacting haphazardly in an attempt to purge actors who have garnered it negative attention. They questioned whether the site was prepared to substantively address the problem of the conspiracy theories that flourish on its platform. And some of the right-wing YouTube stars and conspiracists who were affected saw the disciplinary action as a result of what they say is left-wing ideology flourishing inside Google, of which YouTube is a subsidiary. Mr. Benjamin told Breitbart that the company was “riddled with a far-left ideological orthodoxy that has taken hold to a radical degree.”  A YouTube spokeswoman said in a statement that its “reviewers remove content according to our policies, not according to politics or ideology, and we use quality control measures to ensure they are applying our policies without bias.” What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     The company is in the middle of hiring a large influx of moderators, and it attributed some of its recent enforcement actions to a group who are still learning to apply its rules. “With the volume of videos on our platform, sometimes we make mistakes and when this is brought to our attention we reinstate videos or channels that were incorrectly removed,” the company’s statement said. The moderation efforts of YouTube, like those of Facebook and Twitter, have begun to receive more attention in the last year as academics and journalists have focused on how misinformation — like that sown by Russia during the 2016 presidential election — is spread. In a December blog post, YouTube announced it would add many people to its work force in 2018, hoping eventually to have 10,000 working to moderate or otherwise address content that has violated its rules. The company is in the process of hiring many of those people. A spokeswoman said that applying the company’s standards to any given video required training, and that new moderators were bound to make some mistakes. It said that some of the strikes that had been handed out since the Parkland shooting had been mistaken, though it did not specify which. Jonathan Albright, the research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism and an expert on how misinformation thrives on social media, said YouTube has long been inconsistent in its enforcement of its guidelines. “If these accounts are getting deleted at the last minute because people are angry and news organizations are digging into this, should these accounts have existed in the first place?” he asked.  Negative news media attention results in more users flagging videos of right-wing conspiracy theorists, leading to a feedback loop in which channels promoting those views are disciplined. The effect is that its disciplinary process is reactive, and relies on users to flag content they find troublesome. A YouTube spokeswoman said the company planned to release a transparency report in the spring that it says will show the full range of videos that have been taken down. Zack Exley, a left-wing populist who runs the YouTube channel Left Right Forward, said that the bans of high-profile right-wing accounts may do more harm than good by building up the reputations of extremists among their bases. “The extreme right loves being censored,” he said. “They become heroes and raise tons of money every time YouTube removes or demonetizes their videos.” YouTube does not police misinformation, which, on its own, does not violate the site’s guidelines. But the company says it is confident that, with its steep increase in moderators and progress in machine learning, it will be capable of enforcing its rules effectively, which will help stem the tide of objectionable videos. Mr. Albright said that hiring many more people would help. But he said that those people would have to be trained to address difficult situations, applying the platform’s rules to nuanced videos in which the right decision was not always clear. “It would take a group of people specifically trained in this kind of situation,” he said. “It’s a problem of scale. This stuff doesn’t scale like algorithms. Humans don’t scale.” “YouTube isn’t in a ‘too big to fail’ situation,” he added. “But they’re potentially too big to moderate.” Follow Jonah Bromwich on Twitter: @Jonesieman.

Opinion,167," Supported by By Paul Krugman A funny thing is happening on the American scene: a powerful upwelling of decency. Suddenly, it seems as if the worst lack all conviction, while the best are filled with a passionate intensity. We don’t yet know whether this will translate into political change. But we may be in the midst of a transformative moment. You can see the abrupt turn toward decency in the rise of the #MeToo movement; in a matter of months ground that had seemed immovable shifted, and powerful sexual predators started facing career-ending consequences. You can see it in the reactions to the Parkland school massacre. For now, at least, the usual reaction to mass killings — a day or two of headlines, then a sort of collective shrug by the political class and a return to its normal obeisance to the gun lobby — isn’t playing out. Instead, the story is staying at the top of the news, and associating with the N.R.A. is starting to look like the political and business poison it should have been all along. And I’d argue that you can see it at the ballot box, where hard-right politicians in usually reliable Republican districts keep being defeated thanks to surging activism by ordinary citizens. This isn’t what anyone, certainly not the political commentariat, expected. After the 2016 election many in the news media seemed all too ready to assume that Trumpism represented the real America, even though Hillary Clinton had won the popular vote and — Russian intervention and the Comey letter aside — would surely have won the electoral vote, too, but for the Big Sneer, the derisive tone adopted by countless reporters and pundits. There have been hundreds if not thousands of stories about grizzled Trump supporters sitting in diners, purportedly showing the out-of-touchness of our cultural elite. Even the huge anti-Trump demonstrations just after Inauguration Day didn’t seem to move the conventional wisdom. But those pink pussy hats may have represented the beginning of real social and political change. Political scientists have a term and a theory for what we’re seeing on #MeToo, guns and perhaps more: “regime change cascades.” Here’s how it works: When people see the status quo as immovable, they tend to be passive even if they are themselves dissatisfied. Indeed, they may be unwilling to reveal their discontent, or to fully admit it to themselves. But once they see others visibly taking a stand, they both gain more confidence in their dissent and become more willing to act on it — and by their actions they may induce the same response in others, causing a kind of chain reaction. Such cascades explain how huge political upheavals can quickly emerge, seemingly out of nowhere. Examples include the revolutions that swept Europe in 1848, the sudden collapse of communism in 1989 and the Arab Spring of 2011. Now, nothing says that such cascades have to be positive either in their motivations or in their results. The period 2016-17 clearly represented a sort of Alt-Right Spring — springtime for fascists? — in which white supremacists and anti-Semites were emboldened not just by Donald Trump’s election but by the evidence that there were more like-minded people than anyone realized, both in the U.S. and Europe. Meanwhile, historians have described 1848 as a turning point where history somehow failed to turn: At the end of the day the old, corrupt regimes were still standing. I nevertheless find the surge of indignation now building in America hugely encouraging. And yes, I think it’s all one surge. The #MeToo movement, the refusal to shrug off the Parkland massacre, the new political activism of outraged citizens (many of them women) all stem from a common perception: namely, that it’s not just about ideology, but that far too much power rests in the hands of men who are simply bad people. And Exhibit A for that proposition is, of course, the tweeter in chief himself. At the same time, what strikes me about the reaction to this growing backlash is not just its vileness, but its lameness. Trump’s response to Parkland — let’s arm teachers! — wasn’t just stupid, it was cowardly, an attempt to duck the issue, and I think many people realized that. Or consider how the Missouri G.O.P. has responded to the indictment of Gov. Eric Greitens, accused of trying to blackmail his lover with nude photos: by blaming … George Soros. I am not making this up. Or consider the growing wildness of speeches by right-wing luminaries like Wayne LaPierre of the N.R.A. They’ve pretty much given up on making any substantive case for their ideas in favor of rants about socialists trying to take away your freedom. It’s scary stuff, but it’s also kind of whiny; it’s what people sound like when they know they’re losing the argument. Again, there’s no guarantee that the forces of decency will win. In particular, the U.S. electoral system is in effect rigged in favor of Republicans, so Democrats will need to win the popular vote by something like seven percentage points to take the House. But we’re seeing a real uprising here, and there’s every reason to hope that change is coming. Follow me on Twitter (@PaulKrugman) and Facebook.

Business,168," By JULIE CRESWELL and MICHAEL CORKERYFEB. 28, 2018 Two of the nation’s leading gun sellers, Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods, took steps on Wednesday to limit their sales of firearms, thrusting themselves into the middle of the polarizing national debate over gun control. Walmart, the biggest gun seller, announced late in the afternoon that it would not sell any gun to anyone under 21 years of age. It also said it would no longer sell items resembling assault-style rifles, including toys and air guns. Early in the day, Dick’s said it was immediately ending sales of all assault-style rifles in its stores. The retailer also said that it would no longer sell high-capacity magazines and would also require any gun buyer to be at least 21, regardless of local laws. Under federal law, a person must be at least 21 to buy a handgun from a firearms dealer. But 18-year-olds can buy semiautomatic rifles and other firearms.  The dual announcements, made two weeks after 17 students and staff members were killed in the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., were among the most significant actions taken on guns by corporate America. Both retailers said their decision were a response to the shooting.  Earlier, President Trump met at the White House with a bipartisan group of lawmakers and called for a series of gun control measures, some of which the National Rifle Association has vigorously opposed. Walmart and Dick’s acted after a number of major companies moved last week to dissociate themselves from the N.R.A. Hertz car rental, MetLife insurance and Delta Air Lines, among others, publicly ended their relationships with the organization. In a news release late Wednesday, Walmart noted that in 2015 it discontinued the sale of  high-powered rifles, including AR-15-style weapons, in its stores in the United States. But at the time, Walmart sidestepped any controversy involving gun politics, attributing its decision to lower customer demand for the military-style rifles. This time, Walmart directly linked its action to the shooting in Florida, saying, “In light of recent events, we’ve taken an opportunity to review our policy on firearm sales.” Top Walmart executives made the decision and then informed the board, a company spokesman said. Walmart sells guns in roughly half of its nearly 4,000 supercenters, the company said, but the sheer scale of its customer base gives its decision significant heft. Every week, more than 150 million people around the country shop at Walmart. Dick’s decision was announced by Edward Stack, the 63-year-old chief executive whose father founded the store in 1948. Mr. Stack made clear that he was deliberately steering his company directly into the storm over gun reform. “When we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset,” Mr. Stack said in an interview. “We love these kids and their rallying cry, ‘Enough is enough.’ It got to us.”  He added, “We’re going to take a stand and step up and tell people our view and, hopefully, bring people along into the conversation.” The decision drew immediate — and passionate — reaction on social media. By midday, the number of Twitter messages containing Dick’s name had jumped 12,000 percent from the average over the previous 10 days, according to Sprout Social, a social media management, advocacy and analytics software platform. 
                When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.             About 79 percent of the tweets had a positive sentiment, Sprout Social said, including supportive messages from Hollywood actors and actresses. But the company’s critics posted their plans to no longer shop at the retailer, some closing their tweets with “#boycott.” Investors did not appear to worry about a backlash, as Dick’s stock spent much of Wednesday trading about 1.8 percent higher before finishing up 0.69 percent.      Mr. Stack said Dick’s hoped to move the conversation beyond social media and into the political realm. As part of its stance, the company is calling on elected officials to pass what it called “common sense gun reform”: raising the minimum age to buy guns to 21, banning assault-type weapons and so-called bump stocks, and conducting broader background checks that include mental-health information and previous interactions with law enforcement. This is not the first time that Dick’s has made changes in response to a school massacre. In 2012, after a gunman killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Dick’s removed assault-style rifles from its main stores. But a few months later, the company began carrying the firearms at its outdoor and hunting retail chain, Field & Stream. As of Wednesday morning, the company said, AR-15-style and other semiautomatic rifles will no longer be sold in its 35 Field & Stream stores or on its websites. And this time, Mr. Stack added, the changes will be permanent. Mr. Stack said the retailer had begun scouring its purchase records shortly after the identity of the suspected Parkland killer, Nikolas Cruz, became known. The company soon discovered that it had legally sold a gun to Mr. Cruz in November, though it was not the type used in the school shooting.  “But it came to us that we could have been a part of this story,” Mr. Stack said. “We said, ‘We don’t want to be a part of this any longer.’” That response raised rounds of discussions with the company’s top executives and its directors, all of whom backed the decision to take a stand, Mr. Stack said. He said Dick’s remained a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment and would continue to sell a variety of sport and hunting firearms. Although he has never been a member of the N.R.A., Mr. Stack said, he is a gun owner and enjoys trapshooting. But when it comes to selling guns to individuals under 21 or stocking assault-style rifles, Mr. Stack said, his company is done. “We don’t want to be a part of a mass shooting,” he said. The company said that it had not decided what to do with its inventory of assault-style rifles but that they would not be sold in the marketplace. Legal experts said they saw no likely challenges to Dick’s decision to stop selling assault-style rifles. But the decision to stop selling weapons to anyone under 21, however, could be tested in court. Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the School of Law of the University of California, Los Angeles, said Dick’s could be challenged in lawsuits claiming a violation of laws that bar age discrimination. Although federal civil rights laws do not apply, some states, including New York, prohibit businesses from denying goods and services on the basis of age. “Don’t be surprised if an aggressive attorney general of a gun-friendly state brings an age-discrimination claim against Dick’s,” Professor Winkler wrote in an email response to questions. The company said that it believed its decision was in accordance with the law and that it was instituting the policy immediately. Matthew Haag contributed reporting.

Washington,169," By SHERYL GAY STOLBERGMARCH 13, 2018 WASHINGTON — On the Sunday after a gunman killed 26 people at a church in his home state of Texas, Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, went to tiny Sutherland Springs to comfort the congregation and its grieving pastor, whose 14-year-old daughter was among the victims. A month before, Stephen Paddock had gunned down 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas. Three months later, Nikolas Cruz would rampage through Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and kill 17. But it was Sutherland Springs that turned Mr. Cornyn into something like the Republican face of the gun debate. Nearly every day since the Valentine’s Day massacre in Parkland last month, he has taken to the Senate floor to implore his colleagues to vote for a narrow measure to improve data reporting to the national background check system for gun purchases. It is modest and incremental, but it may be the only piece of gun legislation that can pass the Senate. “I’m trying to figure out what is feasible, what is possible, and to get that done,” Mr. Cornyn, sounding frustrated, said in a recent interview, “because I do not want to see the next victim of a mass shooting knowing that we could have done something that might have changed the outcome but didn’t.”  It is an unlikely endeavor for a man who is an ardent defender of gun rights. In 2013, after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Cornyn voted against expanding background checks to cover guns sold over the internet and at gun shows. He now says he will consider voting for such a bill, so long as private sellers are exempt. “If somebody’s in the business of selling firearms,” he said, “then I believe they should be covered — that’s at the gun shows and that’s over the internet.” His background-check enforcement bill, backed by the National Rifle Association, now has 68 co-sponsors in addition to Mr. Cornyn — nine more than the 60 votes necessary to break a Senate filibuster.  Yet despite his status as the Senate’s second-highest ranking Republican, Mr. Cornyn cannot seem to get his bill to the floor. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, told reporters Tuesday that he was eager to pass it soon, and Mr. Cornyn said he hoped it could pass by next week. But neither offered any specifics on a way forward. As students plan a nationwide walkout on Wednesday to demand tougher gun laws, the slow progress of Mr. Cornyn’s bill is yet another indication of how ossified the gun debate has become in Washington. The measure, known as the Fix NICS Act — NICS stands for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System — is hardly radical and would not do anything to restrict gun ownership. It would simply enforce existing law. Congress passed a similar measure in 2007 after the shooting at Virginia Tech, hoping to improve the reporting of criminal records and mental health information to the gun purchasing database. It did not head off Sutherland Springs, where a gunman legally bought his firearm despite having been convicted of domestic abuse. Yet at least two, and possibly, three Republican senators are blocking the proposal from quick consideration. And Democrats — whose leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, is a co-sponsor of the measure — do not want to allow it to move forward for a vote unless it is paired with more far-reaching legislation, like an expansion of background checks and a ban on assault weapons. “He comes to the floor every day and says, let’s do the small Fix NICS bill and then we’ll see about other proposals,” Mr. Schumer said Tuesday, referring to Mr. Cornyn. “He knows, as well as I do, that Fix NICS is not even close to a response to the epidemic of gun violence in the country.” On the other side of the Capitol, the House is expected to vote Wednesday on a measure, introduced in response to the Parkland shooting, to beef up safety at the nation’s schools. That bill has nothing to do with guns; it would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats. A companion measure in the Senate would also give schools money for physical improvements, such as installing metal detectors or bulletproof windows. “I’m extremely interested in seeing Senator Cornyn’s Fix NICS bill pass, and a significant school safety bill pass,” Mr. McConnell said Tuesday. “The best way to get that done is still under discussion, but I’m anxious to pass both of them and pass both of them soon.”      A former Texas attorney general and justice of the Texas Supreme Court, Mr. Cornyn, 66, grew up around guns. He keeps his license to carry a concealed weapon in his wallet — “My wife and I both got it together,” he said — and recalls learning to shoot as a teenager, with a .22-caliber rifle at target practice.  “Every teenage boy that I know of enjoys that sort of thing,” he said. He hunted deer for a time, but eventually lost interest. “I’d bring home the venison and my wife and daughters didn’t really care for it,” he said. He now hunts birds, usually quail. He says he likes to “consider myself an ethical hunter, which is if you shoot it, you’d better eat it.” While not a member of the National Rifle Association, Mr. Cornyn has an “A+” rating from the group, which backed him enthusiastically the last time he ran for re-election. The Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending, says gun rights interests have given Mr. Cornyn $191,825 from 1989 to 2018. That is more than all but two other members of Congress — Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, and Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. Gun safety advocates are suspicious of Mr. Cornyn. John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, which presses for restrictions on gun rights, calls him “the go-to guy for the N.R.A. in the Senate.” Mr. Cornyn bristled at the suggestion. And he dismissed a recent comment by President Trump, who during a recent White House meeting chided senators for being afraid of the rifle association, with Mr. Cornyn sitting next to him. “I thought that was a throwaway statement,” Mr. Cornyn said. “I don’t know who he was talking to.” The gunman in Sutherland Springs, Devin P. Kelley, had been convicted of assaulting his wife and cracking his infant stepson’s skull while stationed at an Air Force base. But the Air Force never reported the conviction, which would have prevented Mr. Kelley from buying the AR-15 military-style rifle that he used in the mass shooting. Mr. Cornyn says his visit to the church a week after the shooting was profound. The sanctuary had been whitewashed and turned into a memorial. A tent had been set up down the street where the pastor conducted services. “He was holding it together in a superhuman kind of way,” Mr. Cornyn recalled. He said he left thinking he “never wanted to have to confront another grieving family whose loved one’s death may have been prevented by simply making sure that the background check system worked.”  Mr. Cornyn teamed up with Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and an ardent supporter of gun control, on the measure. Mr. Murphy said he gave Mr. Cornyn credit for being “willing to entertain a conversation in which there was no guarantee that the N.R.A. would support the bill.” The bill would impose penalties on federal agencies that fail to report mandated information to the background check system, and would give states grants to improve reporting. Critics, including Cal Jillson, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University who has followed Mr. Cornyn’s career, regard it as an attempt by Republicans to curry favor with voters who were demanding action after the Parkland shooting. “It might help the Republicans establish themselves after the Florida shootings,” Mr. Jillson said, “but there’s not a lot of credit, not a lot of honor in that.” At that, the usually easygoing Mr. Cornyn showed a rare flash of anger. “He’s wrong,” the senator said sharply, “and I would ask him to talk to the pastor at Sutherland Springs who lost his 14-year-old daughter because the background check system didn’t work.” A version of this article appears in print on March 14, 2018, on Page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: Cornyn Pushes a Modest Gun Safety Bill.

Foreign,170," By AUSTIN RAMZYFEB. 23, 2018 HONG KONG — A newspaper controlled by the Communist Party of China criticized the United States for its high level of gun violence, calling it hypocritical that a country that condemns others over human rights violations is failing to stem such slaughter at home. The opinion column in The Global Times, which is run by the Communist Party’s People’s Daily Group, said that after a gunman killed 17 people last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., the United States should look to China, which has strict controls on guns. “It’s inhumane for the U.S., which boasts about its human rights record, to turn a blind eye to gun violence, snub increasing calls for gun control and risk more innocent lives,” the piece said. The column on guns appeared Friday in the English-language edition of the newspaper, but not in the Chinese print version. While The Global Times is controlled by the Communist Party, it is not an authoritative voice, meaning its pugnacious opinion pieces don’t necessarily reflect the views of the Chinese government in the way a commentary in The People’s Daily would.  Still, the view that guns are a human rights issue in the United States is regularly stated by official sources in China. China’s annual report on human rights in the United States, which it issues in response to the State Department’s reports on China’s human rights situation, usually mentions gun violence.  “In 2016, the U.S. government exercised no effective control over guns, law enforcement departments abused their power, and crimes were not effectively contained,” said the most recent report on human rights in the United States from China’s State Council Information Office. “As a result, civil rights, especially the right to life, were seriously threatened and people’s personal rights were continuously infringed upon.” The Global Times regularly covers gun violence in the United States, publishing a commentary after the deadly shootings at a church in Texas in November and a lengthy analysis after the Orlando, Fla., nightclub killings in 2016.      “Gun ownership in China is strictly regulated, which helps reduce gun-related crimes and deaths,” the latest commentary said. “The U.S. should learn from China and genuinely protect human rights.” While China has tight controls on firearms and gun crimes are rare, shootings with illegal firearms do sometimes happen. Knives are the most common weapon used in attacks, leaving unarmed people better able to defend themselves. On Feb. 11 a man with a knife attacked shoppers at a Beijing mall, killing one person and injuring 12 others. Some shoppers and one security guard were seen fending of the assailant with stools and chairs. Terrorist attacks on civilians have sometimes been carried out in China by groups armed with knives, including an attack on a train station in Kunming that killed 31 people in 2014. The killings at Stoneman Douglas High School occurred just as China prepared to celebrate the Lunar New Year, and as a result weren’t widely covered or discussed by the Chinese news media. Some Chinese outlets, including the overseas edition of The People’s Daily, did make note of the death of Peter Wang, a Chinese-American student who was credited with holding open a door to help students flee as the attacker fired. Mr. Wang, 15, was born in Brooklyn and spent some of his childhood in China, friends and family told The Miami Herald. He was a Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps cadet who dreamed of one day attending the United States Military Academy at West Point. The academy issued him a ceremonial letter of acceptance, saying his actions showed commitment to “duty, honor and country.” Zoe Mou and Olivia Ryan contributed research from Beijing.

National,171," By PATRICIA MAZZEI and JESS BIDGOODFEB. 23, 2018 Gov. Rick Scott and top state lawmakers proposed on Friday the most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades, backing new limits that defy the National Rifle Association but fall short of demands from survivors of last week’s school shooting. Faced with massive protests, the Republican governor announced a plan to raise the minimum age to buy any firearm, including semiautomatic rifles, from 18 to 21. Mr. Scott also vowed to strengthen rules to keep weapons away from people who have mental health problems or injunctions against them for stalking or domestic violence. “I want to make it virtually impossible for anyone who has mental issues to use a gun,” said Mr. Scott, who is widely expected to run for a United States Senate seat this year. “I want to make it virtually impossible for anyone who is a danger to themselves or others to use a gun.” Student protesters who rallied at the State Capitol on Wednesday had demanded a complete ban on military-style assault rifles. On Friday, students said they were disappointed, if unsurprised, that Mr. Scott had stopped short of a ban, but vowed to keep pushing for one.  Sofie Whitney, 18, who survived last week’s shooting in Parkland, Fla., and traveled to Tallahassee to lobby lawmakers for stricter gun laws, watched Mr. Scott’s news conference and started texting other survivors as it ended.  “What he’s doing is at least a start,” Ms. Whitney said. “We’re glad that we’ve made progress in such a short time, which is obviously an accomplishment, and we’re more determined to talk to more people to get more things done.” The move from Republicans demonstrated how quickly the politics around guns had shifted in Tallahassee, where the N.R.A. has wielded enormous influence for years. After mass shootings at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016 and in Fort Lauderdale last year, the state’s leaders resisted demands to respond with stricter gun laws. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     Over seven years as governor, Mr. Scott has earned an “A+” rating from the N.R.A. He has opposed stricter background checks and pushed for lowering the cost to get a concealed weapon license. The N.R.A., in turn, flooded voters’ inboxes with pro-Scott mailers during his re-election campaign four years ago. “I’m an N.R.A. member, I’m a supporter of the Second Amendment, and the First Amendment, and the entire Bill of Rights for that matter,” Mr. Scott said on Friday. “I’m also a father, and a grandfather, and a governor. We all have a difficult task in front of us: balancing our individual rights with our obvious need for public safety.” Senator Bill Nelson, the Democrat the governor might challenge in November, denounced Mr. Scott’s proposals, saying they failed to ensure comprehensive criminal background checks or ban assault rifles. “Students, parents and teachers across our state are demanding action — but instead of listening to them, it’s clear the governor is once again choosing to listen only to the N.R.A.,” Mr. Nelson said in a statement. “His leadership is weak and by recommending raising the age to 21 he is doing the bare minimum.” Republicans faced mounting pressure this week to act, as student survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 17 dead, emerged as powerful voices in the national gun control debate.  Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old shooting suspect, was able to legally purchase an AR-15 under Florida’s law allowing 18-year-olds to purchase semiautomatic rifles. By comparison, a person must be at least 21 to buy a handgun. Mr. Scott’s proposed rule, which Senator Marco Rubio also supports, would make 21 the minimum age across the board for all gun purchases. President Trump and the N.R.A. have endorsed putting more armed educators in schools, but Mr. Scott and state Republican legislators did not follow their lead. Instead, Mr. Scott’s plan, which has largely been endorsed by Florida House and Senate leaders, would mandate at least one armed police officer for every 1,000 students at public schools. “I disagree with arming teachers,” Mr. Scott said. “My focus is on bringing in law enforcement. I think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.” Mr. Scott, House Speaker Richard Corcoran and Senate President Joe Negron said they would also push to ban “bump stocks,” which enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster. Bump stocks were used in the Las Vegas mass shooting last year, but not in Parkland. Passage of any legislation would require Republican lawmakers to buck the N.R.A., which says the focus after the shooting should be on keeping “violent criminals and the dangerously mentally ill” from acquiring guns. “Legislative proposals that prevent law-abiding adults aged 18-20 years old from acquiring rifles and shotguns effectively prohibits them from purchasing any firearm, thus depriving them of their constitutional right to self-protection,” Jennifer Baker, an N.R.A. spokeswoman, said in a statement on Thursday. After mass shootings, Republicans have frequently tried to direct attention to the mental health of the gunmen and not the weapons that were used. Experts say that mental illness is not the root cause of most cases of gun violence.  On Friday, Mr. Scott proposed spending $50 million to bolster the state’s mental health resources. He said he wanted to expand access to counseling for young adults with serious mental illnesses and hire dedicated mental health counselors at schools. Going further than the governor’s plan, lawmakers said they would seek to impose a three-day waiting period on all firearms purchases, which now exists only for handguns. They also would create a statewide commission to investigate the school shooting in Parkland, including a number of failures by the authorities. “Government has failed on multiple levels,” said Mr. Corcoran, a likely candidate for governor. “That can never happen again.” The only armed security guard at Stoneman Douglas High, Deputy Scot Peterson, failed to rush into the building as the shooting took place, Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward County revealed on Thursday, a few hours after the deputy had resigned. On Friday, Mr. Trump said the deputy “certainly did a poor job.” Since the shooting, Sheriff Israel has ordered deputies to carry rifles on school grounds. A joint legislative announcement on Friday by Mr. Corcoran and Mr. Negron, about an hour after Mr. Scott’s, indicated that a gun control package has a good chance of passing, even though the annual lawmaking session ends soon, on March 9. It would normally take lawmakers much longer than two weeks to vet and approve major legislation. Senate Democrats have vowed to attach an assault-weapons ban as an amendment to any Republican gun bill, but they are comfortably outnumbered in both chambers. A procedural maneuver by House Democrats on Tuesday to bring a ban to the floor for consideration failed by a party-line vote. The student protesters, who had returned to South Florida early Thursday morning after their trip to Tallahassee, parsed Mr. Scott’s proposals, looking for signs of a shift in the political winds and hints that their activism had swayed the state’s Republican lawmakers. Melanie Weber, 16, said she was not impressed by the governor’s proposal to raise the age to buy firearms from 18 to 21. “The shooter in Las Vegas was in his 50s and the Pulse shooter was 29,” she said, rattling off a grim list of previous mass shootings. But she said Mr. Scott’s mental health proposals were a small step in the right direction.  “If we had laws like that before everything happened,” Ms. Weber said, “it probably would never have happened in the first place.” The students said they were looking to the midterm elections, when they hope voters will elect more lawmakers who support a ban on assault weapons and other gun control measures. “It just makes me want to keep fighting even more,” Julia Bishop, 18, said. “I really don’t want my classmates to die in vain, that’s the biggest thing.” A version of this article appears in print on February 24, 2018, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: In Florida, Plan for Age Limits on Gun Owners.

National,172," By JULIE BOSMANMARCH 2, 2018 FULTON, Ill. — Chris Tennyson, the principal of Fulton High School, was winding his way through the school hallway just before lunch on Tuesday when a female student stopped him, worry etched on her face. From the quiet of Mr. Tennyson’s office, she handed him her phone. On it were screenshots of Snapchat messages sent that morning from a former student. “I’m locked, loaded, and ready to go,” one message read. “People will be hurt, hell maybe even killed. I won’t stop.” Within three minutes of reading the messages, Mr. Tennyson called the police, setting off a response that would force a lockdown of three public schools in Fulton and send several municipal and county law-enforcement agencies in northwestern Illinois hunting for a suspect. Parents throughout this hilly, blue-collar town on the Mississippi River were soon notified that their children, ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade, were being held in their classrooms for their own safety.  In his five years as the principal at Fulton High, Mr. Tennyson, a former Illinois police officer, had never presided over an unplanned lockdown of his school. This time was different. “There’s no standard answer for when you get the police involved,” he said. “I saw what was written as a threat.”  Since the mass shooting last month that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla, scenes of gun threats, scares and lockdowns have played out around the country dozens of times each day. Schools in New Jersey, Michigan, California and Texas have reported a threat of violence, a scramble by police, a rush by school officials to secure a school and the ripples of fear that follow. Communities find themselves navigating a fine, sometimes blurred, line between vigilance and overreaction. A high school in Westport, Conn., was evacuated after a student was overheard threatening a teacher. Worries over a toy gun caused a lockdown at three schools in Arlington, Tex. In Pensacola, Fla., a middle school went into lockdown after a rumor spread that there was a gun inside the school, terrifying students; the rumor turned out to be false. Attentive school administrators are facing a daily dilemma: Take every possible threat seriously and risk a needless disruption to the school day, a noisy police response and a crush of worried parents. Or, ignore what could be a real threat and risk the nightmare of your school becoming the next Parkland. In Fulton, a city of 3,300 people just across the river from Iowa, Tuesday morning began like any other. Students showed up for classes at Fulton High, a low-slung brick building where a red sign in front heralds its team name, the Steamers. Mr. Tennyson, a burly, gregarious former police officer known to his students as “Mr. T,” was making his usual rounds through the hallways, passing rows of shiny lockers where students had fastened Post-its with inspirational messages. (“Try to be a rainbow in someone’s cloud,” one read.)  Before he became a principal, Mr. Tennyson, 48, spent years as a school resource officer in suburban Chicago. He vividly remembers the day of the Columbine massacre in 1999, when he watched news reports from the high school where he was responsible for student safety. “We just thought, ‘Oh my goodness, how could this ever happen in a school?’” Mr. Tennyson recalled. “I knew that the world had changed.” Since the Florida shooting, schools around the country have seen an uptick in threats, incidents of violence and false alarms reported in the media. A group that tracks such reports, the Educator’s School Safety Network, says an average of 70 incidents have occurred daily in the weeks since the Florida shooting, as compared to a more typical pace, of about 10 to 12 incidents a day. Hard to measure, though, is how many of these incidents represent an increase in false alarms, due in part to heightened vigilance, and how many reflect a new surge in truly dangerous threats. On Tuesday morning, when Mr. Tennyson read the messages on the worried Fulton High student’s phone, he instantly knew who was involved. This high school is small — 288 students — and the student who had handed over her phone told him that the messages were from Blake Dornbush, an 18-year-old who graduated from Fulton High last year and had played on the football team. In the eyes of Mr. Tennyson, who knows all of his students, he and Mr. Dornbush had a great relationship. But it had been almost a year since they talked. “I don’t know what’s going on with his life,” Mr. Tennyson said. “I don’t know what’s changed. I don’t know the stressors in his life. There’s no way for me to determine anything that’s going on with Blake in the last year.” He picked up the phone and called the police. The Fulton Police Department is housed in a former bank, eight blocks from the high school. Lt. Donnie R. Pridemore was on duty Tuesday morning. At 11:05 a.m., he got word of a threat at the high school, and when he heard the name of the suspect, Mr. Dornbush, he made an instant connection. This was Fulton. The lieutenant knew Mr. Dornbush’s parents.  Lieutenant Pridemore immediately told school administrators that if they had not yet gone into lockdown, they should now. The elementary, middle and high schools in Fulton instituted a “soft lockdown,” where students are kept in their classrooms and out of hallways.      Jenna Schrader, 18 and a senior, was in the library. She was calm, she said later, reasoning that if the situation was truly dire, the school would have gone into full lockdown with even more extreme measures. After 45 minutes, though, other students began to grow nervous, she said. “You always think about what could happen,” she said. As the students waited, police went to Mr. Dornbush’s home, a pale yellow house with burgundy shutters, where he lived with his parents. Nobody was home. Mr. Dornbush’s parents, called by police, told them that their son was at school. The Midwest Technical Institute in Moline, Ill., where he is studying welding, was a short drive down the river. After a while, Mr. Dornbush returned a call from police on his phone and drove up Route 84 from Moline under strict instructions from the officers. Trailed by unmarked police cars, he drove directly to the Fulton Police Department, where he was interviewed about the Snapchat messages, the police said. Lieutenant Pridemore said he arrested Mr. Dornbush, who was charged with two counts of felony disorderly conduct. Mr. Dornbush was booked into the Whiteside County Jail, where he would remain until Wednesday afternoon, the authorities said, when he was released on $25,000 bond. Mr. Dornbush did not respond to messages, and a woman who answered the door at Mr. Dornbush’s house on Thursday declined to talk. He has yet to enter a plea in the case. Lieutenant Pridemore said that a recent breakup with the student who got the Snapchat messages may have been behind what had happened. “He knew what he did was wrong,” Lieutenant Pridemore said. “He didn’t have a great explanation for why he did it.”  At the Sunrise diner in Fulton on Thursday morning, as a waitress made the rounds and refilled coffee cups, one topic of conversation briefly dominated the room: the lockdown at the schools. Melissa Werner, sitting in a booth by a window, said that her son, Blake, is a 15-year-old sophomore at Fulton High. He seemed to be fine once the lockdown was over, she said, though he was shaken while it was happening. After what occurred on Tuesday, she gave him a stern reminder. “I told my son, ‘You have to watch every little thing that you say,’” she said. “‘People don’t know if you’re being serious.’” Police said that before Tuesday, they had not had any contact with Mr. Dornbush, aside from a few traffic stops. They searched the Dornbush home and found no weapons. Tod Goodell, a friend and former classmate from Fulton High, said he believed that Mr. Dornbush was harmless. “I know Blake and I also know he would not hurt anyone,” he said in a Facebook message. “He said what he said out of anger and I know he regrets it. He wasn’t going to do anything he said he’d do.” The uncertainty of that — whether a threat will result in violence or amount to frightening, rash talk — has sent schools into lockdowns, again and again. Belligerent claims and rumors of violence spread instantaneously in the never-slowing flood of social media. In light of the Parkland attack and other school shootings, Lieutenant Pridemore said, there is no way that police now can risk overlooking a detailed threat. “We can no longer say, ‘Aww, he didn’t mean it,’” Lieutenant Pridemore said. “Times have changed.”  Darryl Hogue, the superintendent of the school district, said he was satisfied that the incident at Fulton High was “isolated, independent and definitely over.” He said he has no way of knowing whether someone will follow through on a promise of violence or not. “I think of that all the time,” Mr. Hogue said. “Was it a real threat? It was a threat enough that we had to act upon it. I don’t know the intentions of the young man.” A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2018, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: A False Alarm? A True Threat?

National,173," By ALEXANDER BURNS and PATRICIA MAZZEIFEB. 22, 2018 When a gunman slaughtered 49 people at an Orlando nightclub in 2016, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, described it as a moment of revelation — a tragedy so grave that it helped prompt his decision to seek a second term. A year and a half later, with no gun violence legislation having been enacted in the interim, Mr. Rubio is again at the center of a churning national debate about public safety and gun control. In a state now stricken by a second catastrophic shooting, Mr. Rubio is under intense scrutiny. So far, he has struck an unsteady balance between firmly supporting gun rights and appearing proactive in response to atrocities at home, with decidedly mixed results. In a televised town hall-style meeting on CNN Wednesday night, Mr. Rubio gamely strained to convince grieving parents and students from Parkland, Fla., that they should view him as an ally. He suggested he might back specific new regulations on weaponry, perhaps including a ban on high-capacity magazines, which allow a gunman to fire a huge number of rounds without reloading. But in a lengthy and emotional colloquy with Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter died in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Mr. Rubio politely refused to endorse a ban on assault weapons, drawing jeers from the audience and visibly frustrating Mr. Guttenberg.  Mr. Rubio leaned further into a different idea on Thursday, saying in an interview that he might file legislation to ban certain large magazines, though he acknowledged that he had yet to settle on a specific proposal or discuss the idea with Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.  “I hope that we can put together a package that I intend to be in the lead on, together with others,” Mr. Rubio said. Mr. Rubio may face intense skepticism in any such effort from Democrats, who see him as frequently feinting toward political independence but seldom actually breaking with his party, and from fellow Republicans who are uncertain of his plans and motives. Republicans have largely given Mr. Rubio a wide berth to respond to a tragedy in his home state, but he is likely to encounter significant resistance on the right in any effort to restrict magazine sales. David Keene, a former president of the National Rifle Association who supported Mr. Rubio in his difficult race for the Senate in 2010, said magazine restrictions would be a nonstarter. “When something like this happens, politicians want to say: I did something,” Mr. Keene said. “Marco Rubio knows better, I think, than to think that’s a realistic response.” Since his defeat in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Mr. Rubio has tried to reorient himself as a man of the Senate — an institution for which he expressed little love during his first term — and make a deeper mark on legislation. He has exercised significant influence in matters of foreign policy, including toward Venezuela and Cuba, and, during the tax debate last year, forced Republicans leaders to modestly expand a refundable child tax credit he has long championed. But in other matters, Mr. Rubio has taken a more muddled approach. He has castigated the Trump administration for its handling of Russia and threatened to vote down Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson’s nomination, only to back away from the confrontation. After advocating a comprehensive immigration overhaul under the Obama administration, Mr. Rubio opposed a bipartisan immigration deal this month, saying that it did not do enough to bolster enforcement. Mr. Rubio maintains that he has demonstrated independence from the G.O.P. by consistently defending Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the presidential election, and been openly critical of the federal government’s initial response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. His reaction to the Parkland shooting, in his view, has built on his longstanding gun policies, now informed by lessons law enforcement and schools officials have learned in the first few days since the massacre at Stoneman Douglas High. On the Democratic side, a mood of cynicism tends to pervade discussions of Mr. Rubio: Representative Ted Deutch, a Democrat who joined Mr. Rubio in the Wednesday town hall and whose district includes Stoneman Douglas High, accused Mr. Rubio of favoring only “legislation that the N.R.A. can live with.”  Still, some Democrats welcomed Mr. Rubio’s apparent openness to new legislative options. Representative Charlie Crist of Florida, a Democrat and former Republican who was once Mr. Rubio’s bitter rival in a Senate primary, said Mr. Rubio’s comments offered reason for optimism. “I’m encouraged by that, to be honest, and I hope that that evolution continues,” Mr. Crist said Thursday. “In the wake of an event such as this, that can happen.” Mr. Crist, a onetime N.R.A. ally who now supports a ban on assault weapons, said much of Florida had undergone a similar reassessment of gun rights orthodoxy after two massacres in the state that targeted young people.      Pushing back on criticism from Mr. Deutch and others, Mr. Rubio fiercely disputed that he operates with great deference to the N.R.A. He countered that he is focused on practical ideas that might stand a chance of becoming law, and said the assault weapons ban favored by Parkland families is not among them. “If that is what the expectation of what action is, by some, they’re going to be disappointed,” he said. Mr. Rubio warned against “heading down the same path” lawmakers followed after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando in 2016. At the time, Mr. Rubio proposed stopping gun purchases for people who had appeared on a federal terrorism watch list in the previous decade, but that idea went nowhere. Without going into detail, Mr. Rubio said on CNN and again in an interview on Thursday that he had become aware of information from law enforcement, arising from the Parkland shooting, that led him to reconsider the magazine limit. “My position has always been that I would vote for anything that would make these shootings either less likely or less lethal — or both,” he said. Precisely how to regulate magazine capacity is unclear, he added: “I don’t know what the right number is.”  In addition to restricting magazine sales, Mr. Rubio also supports raising the minimum age to purchase semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21, an idea he said he mentioned to Mr. Trump on Friday when they flew together on Air Force One from Washington to West Palm Beach. The change has become necessary to update older laws that did not envision the widespread use of AR-15s and similar weapons in mass shootings, Mr. Rubio said. “I’ve never advocated for that in the past, because it largely has never been an issue before,” he said. “Our laws today reflect a time when dealing with gun violence was largely keeping handguns out of the possession of a gangbanger or street thug or what have you. “Obviously since this increase in mass shootings and the epidemic we now face, it’s now become more of a semiautomatic rifle-based tragedy, so our laws have to change to reflect that.” Whether Mr. Rubio has found himself back in the spotlight as a matter of chance, or placed himself there as a political choice, is a matter of some debate among his colleagues in Washington and Florida. Students who disagreed with Mr. Rubio nevertheless thanked him for attending the televised meeting, unlike Mr. Trump and Gov. Rick Scott, who did not accept invitations from CNN. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who appeared at the event with Mr. Rubio, also applauded Mr. Rubio for showing up. Still, Mr. Nelson demanded a far more expansive version of gun control than Mr. Rubio has been willing to consider, and a political adviser to Mr. Nelson said the two men had not conferred about specific bipartisan legislation. “I think he recognizes that there may be productive incremental steps,” Pete Mitchell, a Nelson adviser, said of the senator. “But I think he made it pretty clear that the actual solution has to include — in his words — getting those weapons off the street.” Participating in the CNN event, Mr. Rubio’s allies said, reflected both his sense of duty and perhaps a certain masochistic streak in his personality. There were no illusions within his circle that Mr. Rubio would not face indignant and sometimes hostile questions — and loud jeers on national television — but Mr. Rubio decided to proceed all the same. “No one forced me to run for re-election — I wasn’t even going to,” Mr. Rubio said on Thursday. “I chose this job, and I voluntarily chose to be in this position, because I want to make a difference.” A version of this article appears in print on February 23, 2018, on Page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Senator Finds Himself at Center of a Bitter Debate, Again.

Business,174," By JULIE CRESWELLMARCH 2, 2018 The national debate over gun control is now sweeping up bike helmets and water bottles. REI and Mountain Equipment Co-op, two outdoor retail chains that are also customer cooperatives, said Thursday they were suspending orders for popular items like Bell bicycle helmets and CamelBak water bottles from the company that owns the brands, Vista Outdoor, because Vista also makes assault-style rifles. The move signals an escalation of the stances businesses have taken in the past week in the controversial gun debate since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last month that killed 17 students and staff members. The wave of responses started with a number of companies cutting ties late last week to the National Rifle Association, and gained momentum when Dick’s Sporting Goods, Walmart and Kroger announced changes to their gun policies, including halting the sale of firearms to customers under the age of 21. Late Thursday, L.L. Bean joined its retail counterparts, also announcing a minimum age of 21 to purchase weapons or ammunition in its flagship store in Freeport, Me., the only one where it sells firearms. 
            In the wake of this shooting we have reviewed our policy on firearm sales, and we will no longer be selling guns or ammunition to anyone under the age of 21. ^kw         The stance by REI and Mountain Equipment also signals a widening of the goods and products that are coming under scrutiny in the gun debate. In recent years, Vista Outdoor, like other leading gun manufacturers, has acquired brands that are unrelated to their core firearm or ammunition businesses.  The acquisitions were done, in part, to diversify their revenue sources as gun sales, particularly in the past year under President Trump, have slumped, but also to rebrand, or emphasize, their connection to broader outdoor activities.  On Friday, the stock of Vista Outdoor was down 7.3 percent at the close of the market. In February, the company reported that revenue for its guns and ammunition business in the most recent quarter had fallen more than 20 percent. But its outdoor products group, which makes up about half of its sales and includes brands like Camp Chef outdoor cooking products, Bollé eyewear and Jimmy Stykes paddleboards, showed modest growth. Likewise, in reporting quarterly earnings Thursday, American Outdoor Brands, formerly Smith & Wesson, said that revenue from its firearms segment fell 40.6 percent, and that revenue from Outdoor Products & Accessories increased of 13.4 percent. In its statement, REI said it believed it was the job of companies that manufacture and sell guns and ammunition to “work towards common sense solutions that prevent the type of violence that happened in Florida last month.” REI suggested it was disappointed with Vista for not coming forward with an approach to finding those solutions. After several days of active discussions, REI said it learned that Vista did not plan to make a public statement, outlining a clear plan of action. “As a result, we have decided to place a hold on future orders of products that Vista sells through REI while we assess how Vista proceeds,” the company said. “Companies are showing they can contribute if they are willing to lead. We encourage Vista to do just that.” Vista did not respond to an email seeking comment and has not issued any public response to the decision by the retailers. But one of its brands, CamelBak, tried to distance itself from Vista’s gun selling operation, arguing in a statement that it was an “incorrect assumption that the purchase of any of our products may support a cause that does not fit the mission/values of our brand.” CamelBak, founded in 1989, is popular with athletes for its packs that allow athletes to hydrate without using their hands as well as its brightly colored water bottles. It was acquired by Vista in 2015 for $412 million. “Our brand falls within the Outdoor Products segment of our company, which operates separately from Vista Outdoor’s Shooting Sports segment,” the company said in a statement. That segment manufacturers a variety of guns, including AR-15-style rifles. On social media, some argued that boycotting brands like CamelBak and Giro would only hurt people making quality products. Others chided REI for what they saw as mixing business with politics.      But retailers are being forced to respond to the growing call to arms that is racing across the internet. On Twitter and Facebook, lists and petitions are being widely circulated of myriad companies associated with the gun lobby or brands owned by gun manufacturers, urging customers to boycott and retailers to drop them.  “I only discovered a week ago that my children’s CamelBak water bottles and the Bushnell binoculars that I bought for my 10-year-old who is into birding were associated not only with the gun lobby, but with companies that manufactured assault weapons,” said Sarah Latha, a 39-year-old mother of three who works for the provincial government in Ontario. “It was incredibly disturbing.” On Sunday evening, Ms. Latha put up a petition on change.org demanding that Mountain Equipment stop selling brands owned by Vista Outdoor. It quickly drew more than 50,000 signatures. Mountain Equipment was caught off guard. The cooperative had long sought out products for its five million members that were ethically sourced and environmentally sustainable. As myriad acquisitions occurred in the outdoor goods space in recent years, it had not paid attention to who currently owned the companies and brands. “The ownership links to these products caught us by surprise,” David Labistour, the chief executive of Mountain Equipment, said in an interview Friday afternoon. After reading more than 70,000 comments made in two days through the petition and emails and on its Twitter and Facebook pages, Mountain Equipment reached out to Vista, alerting the company it was suspending further orders of the five Vista brands the retailer carried. Existing inventory would continue to be sold in the store. “Our general purpose is to get all of the brands that we deal with to become advocates in the conversation for the sensible and safe ownership of guns,” said Mr. Labistour, who grew up hunting on his farm in South Africa. “They’re in a tough place, though. They have two very different stakeholder groups.” In an open letter posted Thursday to Mountain Equipment’s members, Mr. Labistour said the decision would not satisfy everyone, noting there were “as many opinions as there are people expressing them.” Mr. Labistour said when it came to consumer activism, he had been fairly cynical, noting there was often a gap or disconnect between what consumers said they would do in a tweet versus what they actually did. But he believes this movement is different. “We’re seeing the industry rally together, and I believe that we can have some influence in starting this conversation about the appropriate ownership and use of firearms,” Mr. Labistour said. “And when it comes to the sale of assault-style and military-grade firearms, that conversation needs to happen now.” A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2018, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Not Just Firearms, but Helmets and Bottles, Too.

National,175," By MATTHEW HAAG and TIFFANY HSUFEB. 26, 2018 The lieutenant governor in Georgia threatened on Monday to kill a proposed lucrative tax cut for Delta Air Lines after the company eliminated a discount fare program for the National Rifle Association over the weekend. The move by Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, who presides over the State Senate, immediately put the legislation in jeopardy and put him at loggerheads with other top state officials, including the governor, who had championed the tax deal. The showdown between one of Georgia’s most powerful politicians and one of the state’s largest employers was the latest clash in a national debate around guns after the deadly school shooting in Florida this month. Mr. Cagle, a Republican, fired the salvo at Delta on Twitter on Monday afternoon, saying that the Atlanta-based company must restore its program with the N.R.A. “Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” Mr. Cagle, who had expressed his support for the bill earlier this month, said on Twitter. 
            I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA. Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.         Mr. Cagle, who received an A+ grade by the N.R.A. when he was running for his position in 2006, did not return a call seeking comment on Monday evening. As the Senate president, Mr. Cagle wields significant influence over legislation and how it flows through the Senate, where Republicans hold a 37 to 19 majority over Democrats. A spokeswoman for Gov. Nathan Deal, who had said the tax bill was necessary to encourage airlines to open direct routes from Georgia to destinations around the world, did not return an email seeking comment.  Other Republicans in the State Legislature also on Monday pulled back their support for the bill, which would grant a $50 million sales tax exemption on jet fuel, primarily benefiting Delta. Among the new critics was the House speaker, David Ralston, who said on Monday that he was disappointed with Delta and wished it had announced the decision before the House approved the tax bill on Thursday. The legislation moved the next day to the Senate, where it seemed to have broad support.  But on Saturday, that support all but evaporated after Delta announced it had eliminated a discount fare program for travelers to attend the N.R.A.’s 2018 annual meeting in May. The airline, which had come under growing pressure from its customers and others to cut ties with the gun group, said its decision “reflects the airline’s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings.” Delta said in a statement on Saturday that it supported the Second Amendment but has refrained from political issues before. The airline noted that it withdrew financial support of a New York production of “Julius Caesar” last summer because it depicted the assassination of a Trump-like Roman ruler. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     In the days after the shooting massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., more than a dozen companies, including MetLife Insurance, Symantec and Enterprise, cut ties with the N.R.A. Many were being threatened with boycotts over the deals and discounts they had offered to the gun group’s members. Also on Monday, FedEx made an unusual move by declaring its opposition to the N.R.A.’s stance on gun policy and safety while saying it “does not and will not deny service or discriminate against any legal entity regardless of their policy positions or political views.” FedEx said that the N.R.A. was one of hundreds of organizations whose members receive discounts on shipping rates. It also pushed for “urgent action” from local, state and federal politicians to prevent future mass shootings. “FedEx opposes assault rifles being in the hands of civilians,” the company said in a statement. “While we strongly support the constitutional right of U.S. citizens to own firearms subject to appropriate background checks, FedEx views assault rifles and large-capacity magazines as an inherent potential danger to schools, workplaces, and communities when such weapons are misused.” Over the weekend, celebrities like Julianne Moore, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Zach Braff posted their plans to boycott FedEx until the company stopped partnering with the N.R.A.

Culture,176," By JAMES PONIEWOZIKFEB. 22, 2018 What makes teenagers amazing — or infuriating, if you’re in an argument with one — is they don’t know what they’re not supposed to be able to do. They haven’t learned that being smart means being cynical about what you can accomplish. They haven’t been hard-wired with platitudes and euphemisms. They haven’t internalized a list of questions that are too naïve or impolite to ask. At CNN’s town hall on gun violence Wednesday, “Students of Stoneman Douglas Demand Action,” this resulted in something you rarely see on TV: accountability. A week after 17 people died in a mass school shooting in Parkland, Fla., a group of angry, grieving constituents was questioning public officials as if they worked for the public. It’s not unusual for news programming after a tragedy to be cathartic or argumentative — cable news can’t resist emotion and conflict. But this was both at once, and that made it something remarkable.  The town hall, moderated by Jake Tapper, was part debate, part memorial (it ended with “Shine,” a song written and sung by students), part public trial for the political and educational system.  The crowd of thousands, clearly favoring the gun regulations advocated by Stoneman Douglas student activists, howled and jeered at Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Dana Loesch, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association. One student condemned politicians for taking the N.R.A.’s “blood money.” The raw, sometimes heartbreaking exchanges didn’t just involve students. Fred Guttenberg, the father of a slain student, told Mr. Rubio that his comments after the shooting had been “pathetically weak.” A teacher who said she had voted for Donald J. Trump spoke out against the president’s suggestion that school faculty carry guns. But it was the students who made it possible, by using their distinctive status as survivors of a tragedy to become the drivers of their story instead of its subjects. They couldn’t be told that it was disrespectful to the victims for them to bring up gun policy; they were among the victims, and the dead were their friends and teachers. They had the aura of ordinary nonpoliticians, but they were also digital-native media savants, organizing hashtag campaigns, planning protests, delivering speeches that went spectacularly viral and nimbly engaging detractors on social media. 
            The big question is: should the media be promoting opinions by teenagers who are in an emotional state and facing extreme peer pressure in some cases?         
            Yeah probably https://t.co/i3HZFY4un8         It fell to Mr. Rubio, as the lone Republican senator at the town hall — and one highly rated by the N.R.A. — to grimly take much of the scolding. It wasn’t just a conflict between liberalism and conservatism, it was a clash between the established dogma of the gun debate and a newly engaged, enraged audience. One exchange in particular summed up this disconnect. Mr. Rubio was challenged by Mr. Guttenberg, who seemed to support a ban on weapons like the AR-15 that the shooter killed his daughter with. The problem, Mr. Rubio said, was that in order to eliminate every weapon with that sort of capability, “You would literally have to ban every semiautomatic rifle that’s sold in America.” The crowd cheered, which did not seem to be the effect Mr. Rubio desired. Mr. Rubio, after years of political argument, may have assumed that his answer was sufficient: You can’t ban that many guns because — well, you just can’t. Everybody knows it. It has been deemed outside the universe of practical solutions.      Suddenly, Mr. Rubio’s rehearsed comebacks wilted like a wizard’s magic wand that had been transformed into a noodle. Pressed on whether he would reject campaign donations from the N.R.A., he kept repeating, “They buy into my agenda,” to no avail.  But Mr. Rubio did get praise from his Senate colleague, Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida (who received a friendlier reception), for showing up. Florida’s governor, Rick Scott (a Republican), declined. Also invited was President Trump, who instead counterprogrammed the CNN special with a “listening session” earlier in the day at the White House, for survivors and family members from Parkland and other shootings. Mr. Trump’s forum was a more controlled and quiet one, including fewer calls for gun regulation, and more supporters of the president’s positions. But by the standards of any other day, it would have been remarkable. Live on TV news, the president — accustomed to getting the first, last and middle words — sat largely quiet, holding a slip of handwritten notes (No. 5 read: “I hear you”) and asking survivors for their ideas and feelings. Their pleas were less political, but anguished, even furious. “It should have been one school shooting, and we should have fixed it — and I’m pissed,” said Andrew Pollack, whose daughter was killed in Florida. It felt raw and volatile in the way that politician-constituent meetings usually are not, especially in the White House. Andrew Pollack, who lost his daughter in the Florida shooting, was a guest at a listening session at the White House. Watching the session, I was reminded of the “arena” TV specials that Roger Ailes staged for Richard Nixon during the 1968 campaign, as described in Joe McGinniss’s “The Selling of the President 1968.” The idea was that depicting Mr. Nixon surrounded by questioners would show him heroically, regardless of his answers. “Nixon stood alone,” McGinniss wrote, “ringed by forces which, if not hostile, were — to the viewer at least — unpredictable. There was a rush of sympathy; a desire — a need, even — to root.” With Mr. Trump, the aim may have been more to show a president not engaged in trying to defeat his questioners but listening to their answers. By Thursday, though, Mr. Trump was vociferously pushing the idea of arming teachers that he’d spoken of warmly in the meeting. This is the part of this essay where I am supposed to note that there have been times when the conversation around an issue seemed to shift — the Sandy Hook shootings, for instance — and then shifted back. That’s what we expect from a smart take — a knowing cautiousness, informed by history.  That instinct is not inaccurate. But the last week of the Parkland students suggests that there is also value in not being too aware of what all the smart people know is impossible.

Washington,177," Supported by NRATV, the organization’s online video channel, has become a little-noticed but vital forum for the dissemination of some of the most strident pro-gun messaging in politics. By Jeremy W. Peters and Katie Benner WASHINGTON — Whenever there is a mass shooting, the National Rifle Association has a well-rehearsed response: Say very little until the inevitable discussion about gun control cools down.  But as the leaders of the country’s most influential gun advocacy group kept quiet after the school shooting last week in Parkland, Fla., that claimed 17 lives, a furious debate played out on NRATV, the organization’s online video channel.  Its hosts spoke chillingly of leftist plots to confiscate weapons, media conspiracies to brainwash Americans into supporting gun control and a “deep state” campaign to undermine President Trump. “Coastal, socialist media elites hate guns so much,” said one of the hosts, Grant Stinchfield, a Second Amendment activist based in Dallas and a radio commentator, that they would take everyone’s away, “leaving only criminals, of course, with the firepower — and all of us at the mercy of evil.” Critics of the N.R.A. say that they have observed a shift in the organization’s tone since Mr. Trump was elected that is much more pugilistic, and that NRATV is where the most outrageous commentary occurs. This change, they say, seems to reflect the fact that like many organizations on the right, the N.R.A. believes it has to guard against complacency among its members with a friendly president in the White House. “There’s no boogeyman in the White House now to make people afraid of,” said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy group. “So they have to make us afraid of one another, and that is how they will market guns in an age when they have a president beholden to them.”  The channel has become a little-noticed but vital forum for the dissemination of some of the most strident pro-gun messaging in politics today, with hosts and guests who are closely allied with Mr. Trump. Few news media operations seem as in sync with the political sensibilities of the Trump era.  They attack the enemies he attacks, condemning the news media as “dishonest” and “failing.” They have questioned the credibility of the F.BI., whose failure to act on tips about the suspect in the Florida shooting has intensified criticism from conservatives seeking to discredit the bureau — this week, Dana Loesch, an N.R.A. spokeswoman, encouraged mass demonstrations outside F.B.I. offices. And they often side with Mr. Trump in divisive cultural disputes — some of which have potent racial undercurrents — like his feuding with Black Lives Matter activists and the professional football players who knelt during the national anthem. With broadcast television-quality production and three dozen original series, NRATV has the ability to reach millions of people through the channels that distribute it like Apple TV, Roku and Amazon Fire TV.  And it has significant resources at its disposal as part of the N.R.A.’s far-reaching “membership support” program. In recent years, that operation alone spent $35.5 million, according to its most recent publicly available tax filing. But it is just the newest piece of a larger news media operation inside the N.R.A. that receives little attention compared with the group’s political and lobbying activity. The organization produces at least seven print and online magazines that have a combined circulation of more than 11 million, according to the N.R.A. Its biggest social media channels on Facebook and Twitter count about 8.7 million followers. On YouTube, five N.R.A.-controlled channels have shared videos that have received nearly 102 million views.  Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the N.R.A., declined to discuss the media effort, the size of its online audience or its programming in the wake of the Parkland shooting. As a matter of policy, he said, the N.R.A. does not discuss proprietary matters.  NRATV is a budding business for the organization, which has brokered sponsorship arrangements with gun makers like Kimber, Mossberg and Ruger to feature their firearms on its programs. Its series cover a range of topics and interests intended to appeal to gun owners of all kinds, like “Armed and Fabulous,” which profiles rifle-slinging women; “Frontlines,” a newsmagazine hosted by Oliver North; and “Under Wild Skies,” which follows hunters in  pursuit of big-game trophies.  But politics and provocation are NRATV’s specialty. It has singled out news outlets and attacked individual journalists like Don Lemon of CNN, who was targeted in an ad that accused the anchor and his network of smearing Mr. Trump and colluding with Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. In one video released this month, Ms. Loesch, a former Tea Party activist and Breitbart editor, pretended she was about to burn a copy of The New York Times. Stories that circulate throughout right-wing news media often find their way to NRATV, which has devoted numerous segments to portraying anti-Trump demonstrators as paid shills, violent extremists and evangelists for Shariah law in the United States. Its guests and hosts are not shy of trading in racially charged language and imagery. A promo for a program called “Noir” featuring a Navy SEAL member named Dom Raso opens with a dramatization of a foiled robbery. A black man wielding a knife grabs and forces a white woman to the ground as an armed bystander reaches for his handgun and rushes to her defense.       After Mr. Trump’s inauguration last year, an NRATV correspondent, Chuck Holton, tweeted that it was time to “get busy scrubbing Obama’s mocacchino stain off of America!” — an apparent reference to the color of President Barack Obama’s skin. The N.R.A.’s practice is to keep a low profile after mass shootings, as it did after the massacres in Newtown, Conn., and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. But it was always quietly talking to its members, first by email and later on NRATV, said Danny Barefoot, a partner at Anvil Strategies, an ad agency and communications company that has worked with gun control groups.  “In those moments, the goal isn’t to disseminate mass information and persuade a lot of people, ” Mr. Barefoot said. “The strategy is to be a messenger to the N.R.A.’s own people.”  Eli Pariser, the co-founder of Upworthy, a site that delivered progressive political videos to targeted audiences on Facebook, said that while videos produced by NRATV after a shooting might not go viral, they helped viewers “feel they’re part of a community, led by a news source that speaks to them.” NRATV can galvanize members in the wake of a shooting in part because the N.R.A. has coached its followers to believe that the organization is the only credible source for news and information on any gun issue or controversy.  NRATV’s slogan — “America’s Most Patriotic Team on a Mission to Take Back The Truth” — reinforces a sense of mistrust in traditional news media,  as do its hosts. In the days after the Parkland shooting, Mr. Stinchfield and Ms. Loesch, two of the channel’s most prominent faces, were relentless in their attacks on the news media. “If it can topple us, it gets a direct path to the Second Amendment,” Mr. Stinchfield told viewers this week from the organization’s studio in Dallas. “They will stop at nothing to put us out of business.” Some of his more recent antics have included taking a sledgehammer to a television set as clips from MSNBC, CNN and ABC play onscreen, and inviting North Korea to launch a nuclear weapon on Sacramento, where the California state legislature has approved numerous gun control measures opposed by the N.R.A. Mr. Stinchfield went on to question the competence and motivation of the F.B.I. “It is time the F.B.I. got back to the business of keeping Americans safe, instead of being so focused on political vendettas,” he said. He then turned the microphone over to Mr. Holton, who saw a slippery slope in new gun regulations and identified a new culprit in the proliferation of school shootings: the news media. “People could just as easily call for restrictions on the first amendment,” Mr. Holton said. “They could say, ‘Hey, let’s make it illegal to report on those school shootings because we all know, I mean, there’s no doubt that the media circus that takes place every time one of these things happens causes more school shootings.”  Jeremy W.

Almost everyone who lives or works in a big city knows the feeling: You’re sitting inside a quiet subway car when the doors open and a throng of children — often on a class trip — boards the train. Your quiet car is suddenly loud and packed with people jostling for space. Sometimes, it’s worth moving to another car. On my morning commute yesterday, one of these throngs entered my subway car, but this time I didn’t mind at all. The teenagers — a mix of black, white, Latino and Asian — were in a buoyant mood. Many were carrying signs. They were headed to a gun protest outside the White House. At times yesterday, the protesting students seemed to be everywhere — on social media, on television, in communities. And they offered a needed jolt of inspiration in a dark political time. David Axelrod, the political strategist, has said that today’s central political battle is cynicism versus idealism, and it’s clear which side the students are on. If you haven’t yet looked at photos, videos or media coverage of the protests, I encourage you to do so. • The students held a 17-minute silence outside the White House yesterday to honor the 17 victims from Parkland, Fla. (and Nathalie Baptiste of Mother Jones has a short video). • The Times collected images from around the country. • “The laws are going to be written, they’re going to be passed, and they’re going to be upheld, because we are not going to stop until it does,” said Cate Whitman, a junior at LaGuardia High School in New York, during a rally. Pennsylvania’s 18th. As expected, Conor Lamb, the Democratic candidate in Tuesday’s special election, continues to look like the winner as the final votes are counted. “Every single indicator suggests,” The Weekly Standard’s David Byler writes, “that Trump’s unpopularity has hurt Republican candidates—including Saccone—and will continue to do so through November.” A new militarization. Among the many reasons to be worried about a State Department run by Mike Pompeo (and Donald Trump) is what my colleague Roger Cohen has called “a radical militarization of American foreign policy.” Former military officers occupy a growing list of top government jobs, which suggests that military action may increasingly replace diplomacy as America’s main foreign-policy tool. “The tea leaves here are not encouraging,” Stewart Patrick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote for its website. He notes that Pompeo has been an outspoken advocate of paramilitary covert action and expanded it while running the C.I.A. Some State Department staffers, Vanity Fair’s Abigail Tracy reports, “fear that Pompeo will over-militarize the State Department.” As one of them told Tracy last year, when Pompeo’s tenure was still only rumored, “Pompeo ‘would be the secretary of war, not state.’” Bret Stephens, with a different take, sees promise in Pompeo’s appointment. Bret’s column, in fact, is titled, “Mike Pompeo Is Good for Diplomacy.” You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook. I am also writing a daily email newsletter and invite you to subscribe.

Opinion,179," Supported by Opinion By Anthony Swofford Before the United States Marine Corps allowed me to carry a live M-16 assault rifle, I went through hundreds of hours of firearms training. Classroom sessions devoted to nomenclature, maintenance and basic operation accounted for more than two weeks of study before I even set eyes on ammunition. For weeks, I carried an M-16 without a magazine — a dummy weapon, basically. I secured it with a padlock overnight while I slept in the barracks, and unlocked it each morning before chow. Only at the shooting range was I allowed to check out magazines and ammo from the armory. The first day at the range I spent 12 hours disassembling, cleaning and reassembling the weapon. I had to do this blindfolded. I had to do this while a drill instructor hurried me, yelling that enemies were at the gate. I had to do this while fellow Marines wept nearby from doing hundreds of burpees as punishment for not being able to reassemble their weapons fast enough. The military issue M-16 is the model for the AR-15 assault rifle that the accused shooter used to kill 17 people this month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The shooter bought the weapon lawfully. He received zero hours of mandated training. There is no reason that any civilian, of any age, should possess this rifle. At the White House on Wednesday, President Trump suggested that if a football coach at the high school, Aaron Feis, had been armed, he would have saved even more lives than he did, perhaps even his own, because rather than simply shielding students from gunfire, he could have drawn his weapon, fired and killed the assailant — putting a tidy end to the rampage. This is absurd. More likely, had Mr. Feis been armed, he would not have been able to draw his weapon (a side arm, presumably) quickly enough to stop the shooter, who with an AR-15 would have had the coach outgunned. Even if the coach had been able to draw his weapon — from where? his athletic shorts? — any shots he managed to fire would have risked being errant, possibly injuring or killing additional students. As some studies have shown, even police officers have missed their targets more than 50 percent of the time. In firing a weapon, Mr. Feis would have only added to the carnage and confusion. What if a history teacher had also been armed? And an English teacher, and a math teacher, and the janitorial staff members? In this National Rifle Association fever dream, a high school would concentrate so much firepower in the hands of its employees that no deranged individual with a weapon would dare enter the premises. This sort of thinking also has no grounding in reality. People attack heavily armed institutions all too often, as with the mass shootings in 2009 at Fort Hood in Texas and in 2013 at the Washington Navy Yard. Assailants in such cases aren’t typically worried about losing their lives in the process. Usually, losing their lives is part of the plan. A few days ago, the lunacy of the suggestion to arm teachers was driven home to me as I prepared to teach my undergraduate creative writing class. I arrived uncharacteristically early and sat down with a few students to banter about this and that. Suddenly, there was a loud bang outside. Everyone froze, until we realized it was a campus utility truck backing up to a loading dock. Then the students relaxed again. But I spent the next few minutes before class thinking about whether the windows opened fully and would enable 20 kids to escape an active shooter. I checked: They did not open at all. I noticed to my dismay that the door to the classroom opened out, not in, which thwarted my plan to throw my heavy table up against the door in case a shooter blasted his way down the hall. Even after class began, I found myself fantasizing about inventing a bulletproof Kevlar curtain that I could have at the ready to affix to the door frame if the need arose. Here is something I didn’t think about: I did not think about arming myself to protect my students. President Trump on Thursday specified that he wants only certain teachers — “highly adept people, people that understand weaponry” — to be armed. I will immodestly state that among professors in the United States, I am almost certainly one of the best shooters. But I would never bring a weapon into a classroom. The presence of a firearm is always an invitation to violence. Weapons have no place in a learning environment. Last month, the State Legislature in West Virginia, where my university is located, introduced the Campus Self-Defense Act. This would prohibit colleges and universities from designating their campuses as gun-free zones. If this act becomes law, I will resign my professorship. I will not work in an environment where professors and students pack heat. When I was a young Marine, I had to learn how to use many weapons. It was part of my mission to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States.” My mission these days is to write books and teach literature and creative writing. It’s a noble calling, too. But no one should be asked to put his life on the line for it.

Washington,181," By ALI WATKINS and KATIE BENNERFEB. 22, 2018 WASHINGTON — The Justice Department plans to ask United States attorneys to prioritize the prosecutions of prospective gun buyers who lie on federal background check forms, according to two law enforcement officials briefed on the decision. The request, part of a larger set of recommendations by the Justice Department expected to be announced in the coming days, would essentially enforce existing laws that govern gun purchases. It allows the Trump administration to take action on gun-related violence without riling opponents of more restrictive gun policies. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. The directive comes as the Trump administration weighs responses to the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last week, in which  17 people were killed. But the renewed emphasis on background checks would not have stopped the suspect in that shooting, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, who legally purchased several firearms — including an AK-47 within the past month.  Thousands of prospective gun buyers are denied firearm purchases every year through the F.B.I.’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Prospective buyers must fill out a six-page application, including whether they have ever been convicted of or indicted in a crime, which would disqualify them from purchasing a firearm.  The buyer can be approved, denied or issued a delay for the purchase. Under the third option, the firearms dealer must wait three days while the F.B.I. determines whether the prospective buyer’s application is truthful and whether that person is eligible to buy a gun. If firearms dealers do not hear back from the bureau during the waiting period, they are legally allowed to sell the gun. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     While lying on the background forms is a felony, it is a crime that has rarely, if ever, been prosecuted. Thousands of prospective gun buyers are denied firearms purchasers annually, but between 2008 and 2015, fewer than 32 cases a year were even considered for prosecution, according to the Justice Department’s inspector general. The new directive is expected to be welcomed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is responsible for policing background check violations. But it is unclear whether federal prosecutors offices will share the enthusiasm, and whether there will be any recourse if the guidance is not heeded. Gaps in the background check system have prompted scrutiny in an array of high-profile failures. Its three-day waiting period loophole allowed Dylann Roof, who in 2015 murdered nine people in a Charleston, S.C., church, to buy the gun used in the shooting, despite having been charged that same year with felony drug possession. Despite issuing a hold on his purchase, the F.B.I. did not get back to the local gun dealer who sold Mr. Roof the weapon he used in the shooting within the three-day waiting period. The dealer legally sold Mr. Roof the gun when he returned after the waiting period. In November of last year, Devin P. Kelley killed 26 people at a Texas church with firearms that a background check should have indicated he was not permitted to purchase. Mr. Kelley’s criminal record — he was kicked out of the Air Force after being convicted of domestic violence in 2014 — was never transmitted from the service to the F.B.I. More recently, thousands of people with outstanding warrants were purged from the background check system over a discrepancy over the definition of the word “fugitive,” which the Justice Department said should not necessarily preclude someone from purchasing a firearm.

National,182," By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS and JACEY FORTINFEB. 22, 2018 Paul Hankins keeps a box of smooth, colorful river stones — he calls them “fidgets” — in his classroom for students to hold when they need to soothe their nerves. The stones also have a different purpose, as do the billiard balls and the plank from the old gym floor. They can all be used as weapons in an emergency. “Before we go to the corner where everybody gets invisible, grab one of those,” he tells his students at Silver Creek High School in Sellersburg, Ind. “We could cause one hell of a ruckus if we need to.” Mr. Hankins does not begrudge teachers who argue that they should be allowed to carry guns to class, especially in the wake of attacks like last week’s shooting that killed 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.  For him, stones are better. They put the fight in “Run, hide, fight,” the mantra that he and countless other teachers are learning as lockdown drills become routine.  Yet experts are as divided as Mr. Hankins and his colleagues on how to protect students from violence or whether, for that matter, there is anything that can be done to prevent a determined attacker. The latest shooting has intensified the debate over what tactics to use to protect against imminent danger: whether teachers should carry guns, or hide with their students; whether schools should invest in fancy security devices like door jammers or put more resources into crisis teams that could identify and intervene with troubled students. What follows is some of the discussion. Most law enforcement experts argue that teachers should not carry guns. Civilians may be able to hit a bull’s-eye at the shooting range, but they lack the tactical knowledge of handling weapons that trained law enforcement personnel get. Accidents happen. Guns can fall out of holsters, be taken from the classroom or accidentally discharge. “You don’t want to have a gun that’s available to a student or another worker who may have mental health issues,” said Maureen S. Rush, vice president for public safety and superintendent of the Police Department at the University of Pennsylvania. But some disagree. Dave Workman, the senior editor of The Gun Mag and communications director of the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, said arming guards or teachers could act as a deterrent so that no one had to draw a weapon in the first place. “I understand the debate out there: ‘Should this be the job of a teacher?’” he said. “Why not? The teacher is going to be there,” Mr. Workman said. “They become the first responder sometimes. It does take a while for police to respond to an incident.”  The Parkland school had an armed sheriff’s deputy who never encountered the gunman. Metal detectors are unlikely to stop a gunman, experts say. But they can be useful in certain contexts, if, for instance, the school is in a neighborhood with high crime or gang activity, where students may try to bring guns or knives into school to defend themselves. In a lockdown drill, everyone in the school practices responding seamlessly to the presence of an intruder. Teachers and students go to a secure location, like a classroom, closet or storage area that can be locked, and move out of sight, away from windows or doors. Speed is important. The typical gunman is like water, the experts said, following the path of least resistance. Typically, a gunman will not try to kick in a closed door, but will look for one with a crack of light showing. “Within 20 or 30 seconds, I, as a bad guy, should have very little easy access to anybody,” said David R. Connors, head of Connors Security Consulting Services in Spencerport, N.Y., and a former police officer. The locks or barricades on the doors do not need to be very strong, just enough to last until help can arrive. The point of a lockdown drill is to know what to do automatically, without having to think. “When something’s going down, you will not respond from your head, you will respond from your stomach,” Ms. Rush said. “You need to get that in your stomach. You need to know what instinctively you will do. That’s got to be part of your psyche. So it requires constant training.” Different schools or districts may have different protocols. The important thing is that everyone, from teachers to students to parents, know what they are. “It has to be something that goes like clockwork,” said Dr. Irwin Redlener, a professor of pediatrics and public health and the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. It may be heart-wrenching, but don’t open the door, experts say. A teacher has to think of the lives of the many who have moved to a safe place over the one person outside in the hallway who may bring danger in. “You don’t open that door until you know the police are on the other side,” Ms. Rush said, adding, “You’re doing it for the masses of kids.”      It depends on their age. “We don’t have to scare the heck out of these kids,” Mr. Connors said. “In a kindergarten through third-grade building, you might tell the kids, come over here and sit down next to the wall. Be nice and quiet. I’m going to read you a book. That’s all the kids have to know.”  Mr. Connors does not believe in making drills too realistic. “You don’t have to have someone come over and try to kick in the door. I don’t think that’s constructive. With staff, yes. But not with kids.” Phones should be put on silent, not even vibrating. “Texting is fine,” Ms. Rush said. “You want to be invisible, and you want silence.” Ms. Rush said she was alarmed by the students who took videos while hiding from the gunman in Parkland, not because she disapproved of the video, but because it changed their mentality. “That could be taking them out of their survivor mode,” she said. The experts vary on whether this is possible. Some say that students who become violent are often not the ones who seem most troubled or who make the most noise. “The perpetrators are very often not the bullies or the guys roughing people up,” Mr. Connors said. “Quite often, it’s the guy who is quiet. In hindsight, they’ll go back and find that there’s some family or mental health issue.” Others say that schools can do more to enlist students to help identify troubled classmates. Social media can be an early warning system, the experts say. Students may express their violent thoughts there, as did Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged in the Florida shooting, according to law enforcement officials. “These kids are begging us to stop them,” said Amy Klinger, a co-founder of the Educator’s School Safety Network, who consults on school safety from the perspective of the former teacher and principal that she is. “We just have to be better at picking up the warning signs.” The schools alone cannot do it. Arguably, Dr. Klinger said, the failure to identify Mr. Cruz as troubled was a failure of the entire community, along with law enforcement agencies that had been warned about him. “A school can identify the individual of concern, but they didn’t create that individual,” Dr. Klinger said. “So yeah, there is a role that the community and parents and our society has to play in identifying and dealing with those individuals as well.”  Law enforcement experts suggest hardening the perimeter, that is, putting up security cameras, door buzzers, gates, and other barricades or high-tech devices. But they say that buzzers are not enough, especially at arrival and dismissal times when hundreds of students may be milling around. “After Sandy Hook, a lot of schools got very panicky and bought $5,000 buzzer systems,” Dr. Klinger said. “They bought the system that was breached by the intruder in the first 30 seconds of Sandy Hook. He shot out the door and walked into the school. So your buzzer system did absolutely no good.” Ms. Rush said that everyone at the front office should be informed when a student has been suspended or expelled. A photo should be posted, and they should call 911 if the person appears. “This happens in corporate America all the time,” she said. “Workplace violence, where the person comes back and wants to kill the boss.” Dr. Klinger said that schools should invest in teachers who mingle with students in the lobby or in hallways as a way to learn about troubling behavior that may be brewing. Even in a large school, the experts said, doors need to be manned by someone who knows the students and will recognize anyone who looks out of place. Dr. Klinger said that this should be a teacher, who relates to the students, not a security guard. “If you want to take this to the extreme, you can ensure the safety of kids by locking them in a cell, but that’s a prison,” Dr. Klinger said. “This is not a prison. It’s not a shopping mall.” Cultivate the survivor mentality, experts said. Fight. “If he’s coming no matter what, if you got that one guy who starts breaking the door out, you take every object in the room and you beat the hell out of him to disarm him, because you’re going to die if you don’t,” Ms. Rush said. “So you might as well take your chances of trying to fight.”  Ms. Rush gave the example of a professor who, as a gunman approached, took his phone out to look at pictures of his children one last time before he died. “But a female student jumped and ran and locked the door. She had survivor instinct.” A version of this article appears in print on February 24, 2018, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: What Experts Say About Armed Teachers and School Safety.

Opinion,183," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Ashley Nicolas For nine months in Kandahar, Afghanistan, I went through the same routine every day. I put on my uniform and tied my boots. I put a magazine in my 9-millimeter handgun and locked it in my hip holster. I put a 30-round magazine in my M4 and slung it over my shoulder. If the day included a patrol, I put on my body armor. I usually carried a knife and at least one tourniquet. Every day, our team discussed base security to identify where we were most prone to attack. That was my standard procedure while serving with the United States Army in a combat zone. When I left active duty in 2014, I never expected that those skills would be applicable to my next job, as a high school teacher in San Jose, Calif. But the reality is that much of what I learned in the Army is horrifyingly relevant in the classroom. My school conducted drills similar to those that took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., even before a gunman opened fire last week and killed 17 people. Our first drill, during which staff practiced sheltering students and barricading doors, exposed countless weaknesses, making it obvious to me that we were woefully unprepared to protect our charges. My classroom would be one of the first an attacker coming through the front entrance would see. So I set out to make it a “hard target” — a place that would appear difficult to attack — to deter an intruder. The classroom was big, with doors on opposite ends. I wrestled with the idea of enlisting the help of my maturest students in securing such a large space, ultimately deciding that I would take only volunteers from my upper-class classroom aides. I pondered how to construct impromptu blockades to delay or confuse an attacker. My helpers and I moved the cart of class iPads to where it could be easily pushed in front of the door — an ideal barricade. Still, the large windows extending the length of the room, once a pleasing feature, now looked only like a gaping vulnerability. We covered the windows in butcher block paper to obstruct the view from outside. I also took a tourniquet from an old Army first aid kit and put it in the top drawer of my desk, alongside the calculators and pencils. I knew that if there were multiple casualties, a single tourniquet wouldn’t do much, but it might save one of my kids. I considered the fastest way to get my students into cover, or at least concealment, and agonized over how to keep dozens of 14-year-olds calm during an attack. I was preparing my classroom for combat. But our school was built to cultivate learning, not withstand an attack; our teachers were trained to instruct, not shield students from bullets. Fortunately, I never had to confront the horror of a gunman roaming the hallways of my school. Still, Parkland could have been my classroom. Those kids — some of whom had only algebra textbooks as a defense against bullets — could have been my students. I felt more prepared than many of my colleagues because I knew how to stop bleeding, spot vulnerabilities and control a chaotic situation. Yet teachers shouldn’t need to have military or law enforcement experience. As children and parents appear on TV begging for action, our elected officials insist that even the best gun control and safety reforms would not eliminate attacks. Some, like Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, extol the virtues of layered defense systems, similar to those employed at military checkpoints. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos called for teachers to have the “opportunity and option” to carry weapons in school. President Trump proposed Thursday that trained teachers should be offered a bonus for carrying a concealed weapon at school. Others suggest putting combat veterans in classrooms. These people would prefer to subject our children to daily interactions with armed guards and our teachers to the awful possibility of using deadly force rather than engage in a principled conversation about gun control. Instead of curbing the violence, our leaders prefer to go on the defensive and fortify our schools against the next semiautomatic rifle that will “inevitably” walk through the door. But our legal system is designed to evolve, to push us toward a “more perfect union.” Yes, we need to arm our teachers — with the support of effective gun control, comprehensive background checks, better information-sharing between local and federal authorities, engaged parents and school-sponsored mental health care providers to identify troubled students before they become killers. Taking actions that make these calamities far less frequent and far less deadly should not be a partisan issue. When I took an oath to protect and defend, I did not consider that it would extend to my future classroom. Tragically, the heroism of educators in Parkland like Aaron Feis and students like Alaina Petty, Peter Wang and Martin Duque, cadets in their school’s Junior R.O.T.C. program, make it clear that unless we significantly strengthen gun control in this country, we must begin to expect the same levels of sacrifice from teachers and students when they pick up a pencil as we do of soldiers when they pick up a weapon. For many of us, spending our youth in a military at war means that we will spend a lifetime memorializing our brothers and sisters who did not come home. That is not a reality that 14-year-olds should have to confront when they head to school for the day. America’s schools should not be a combat zone.

Washington,184," By MICHAEL D. SHEARFEB. 26, 2018 President Trump criticized the armed sheriff's deputy who failed to enter Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School during a mass shooting there on Feb. 14. WASHINGTON — President Trump asserted Monday that he would have rushed in to save the students and teachers of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School from a gunman with an assault weapon, even if he was unarmed at the time of the massacre. Speaking to a meeting of the country’s governors at the White House, Mr. Trump conceded that “you don’t know until you test it.” But he said he believed he would have exhibited bravery “even if I didn’t have a weapon, and I think most of the people in this room would have done that, too.” The president’s remarks came during an hourlong televised conversation with the governors in the State Dining Room, during which Mr. Trump continued to grapple publicly with how best to respond to the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., discussing such things as arming teachers and reopening mental institutions. As Mr. Trump skipped from one possible solution to another, he mused about the “old days,” when potential criminals could be locked in mental hospitals, and he vowed to ban “bump stocks,” an accessory that can make a semiautomatic weapon fire rapidly, more like an automatic rifle. But he dropped any mention of raising the age required to purchase a rifle to 21 from 18, something he said last week he supported, despite opposition from the National Rifle Association.  But the president continued his dayslong verbal assault on Florida sheriff’s deputies, calling their reported failure to respond to the Parkland school massacre, which killed 17 staff members and students, “disgusting” and “a disgrace.” He said the deputies “weren’t exactly Medal of Honor winners, all right.”  A lawyer for Deputy Scot Peterson of the Broward County Sheriff’s Office said Monday in a statement that Mr. Peterson did not run into the school when the shooting began because he thought the shots were coming from the outside. Mr. Peterson retired Thursday after Sheriff Scott Israel branded him “a coward” for failing to run into the building to try to save students. Mr. Trump echoed that sentiment, saying that the performance of Mr. Peterson and three other deputies whose actions have been questioned “was, frankly, disgusting.” Later, he added that “the way they performed was really a disgrace.” As lawmakers returned to Washington after a weeklong break, the president used the White House forum on Monday to insist that politicians do something quickly to ensure that shootings like the one in Florida will never happen again. The politics of guns for Republicans continue to be difficult. Georgia’s lieutenant governor, Casey Cagle, a conservative Republican, said on Monday that he would block any tax break for his state’s largest employer, Delta Air Lines, if the company does not reinstate discounts for N.R.A. members that it suspended after the shooting. And Mr. Trump — who said he had lunch Sunday with N.R.A. leaders — publicly clashed with Washington State’s Democratic governor about the benefits of giving guns to some teachers. Mr. Trump said again that he supports a bill to strengthen the system of background checks made during some gun purchases. That legislation is sponsored by Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate who said on Monday that he would move forward with his background-check bill as early as this week. But the two top Republicans in Congress — Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader — have largely been silent on the broader debate about possible changes to gun laws after the Florida shooting. Mr. Trump tried to take the lead. “We have to have action. We don’t have any action,” Mr. Trump complained. “A week goes by, ‘Let’s keep talking.’ Another week goes by, we keep talking. Two months go by — all of the sudden, everybody is off to the next subject. Then, when it happens again, everybody is angry and, ‘Let’s start talking again.’ We got to stop.”  Mr. Trump said that was his message during his lunch on Sunday with Wayne LaPierre, the head of the N.R.A., and Chris W. Cox, the group’s top lobbyist. He called the pair “great patriots” and “great people” who want to “do something” quickly to prevent more school shootings. “Don’t worry about the N.R.A. They’re on our side,” the president told the governors. “You guys — half of you are so afraid of the N.R.A. There’s nothing to be afraid of. And you know what? If they’re not with you, we have to fight them every once in a while. That’s O.K.” But even as he chided his predecessors in Washington for their delays and inaction, Mr. Trump’s own preferred solutions remained elusive Monday as he continued what administration officials described as a “listening” phase of the response. “We’re still listening and making and determining the best steps forward,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters after the president’s session with the governors on Monday morning. Mr. Trump lamented a period in history when he said mentally unstable people who had not yet committed a crime could be committed to a mental hospital if it were clear they were acting like a “boiler ready to explode.”      “You could nab somebody like this,” Mr. Trump said of the Florida shooting suspect, Nikolas Cruz, citing the scores of warning signs that Mr. Cruz was troubled. “You can’t arrest him, I guess, because he hasn’t done anything.” But he said too many of the governors in the room had closed the mental hospitals that might have been a solution to that problem, often because of how expensive they were. “We have no halfway. We have nothing between a prison and leaving him at his house, which we can’t do anymore,” Mr. Trump told the governors. “So I think you folks have to start thinking about that.” Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State appeared to annoy Mr. Trump during a testy exchange about the president’s proposal to protect students by allowing trained teachers to carry concealed weapons in schools.  “It would just be a very small group of people that are very gun adept,” Mr. Trump told the governor. Mr. Inslee responded that giving guns to any number of teachers, coaches or administrators in the schools would be wrong, and he urged the president to abandon the idea. “I’ve listened to the first-grade teachers that don’t want to be pistol-packing first-grade teachers,” Mr. Inslee said as the president frowned and folded his arms across his chest. “I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. And let’s just take that off the table and move forward.” Mr. Trump did not acknowledge the criticism and moved quickly to remarks from Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican. In a separate meeting with the spouses of the governors, the first lady, Melania Trump, gave brief remarks that also touched on the shooting at the Florida high school. She praised the students from the school who have been demanding action from politicians. “I have been heartened to see children across this country using their voices to speak out and try to create change,” Mrs. Trump said. “They’re our future and they deserve a voice.” Ms. Sanders said later that the president also supported the students who had been protesting, even though he opposes the ban on assault weapons that many of them have been calling for. “That’s the reason why he had a number of them here at the White House just last week,” Ms. Sanders said. “It is one that is very important and should be listened to. We want to continue that dialogue as well as continue the conversations with state, local and federal officials.”  The governors came away impressed by Mr. Trump’s resolve to address the issue, according to Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, a Republican and chairman of the National Governors Association. Noting that he leads the state that last year endured the deadliest mass shooting in American history, Mr. Sandoval added that the governors shared the urgency. “There’s a consensus that something needs to be done.” But there was no consensus about Mr. Trump’s idea of arming trained teachers or other school personnel. “I have three kids,” said Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, a Democrat and the vice chairman of the association. “I don’t want my teachers armed. I don’t think most Americans do.” Reporting was contributed by Eileen Sullivan, Peter Baker and Katie Rogers from Washington, and Patricia Mazzei from Miami.

Washington,185," By PETER BAKER and MICHAEL D. SHEARFEB. 22, 2018 Charles Whitman opened fire on the University of Texas campus in 1966. Since then, the images of school shootings across America are almost indistinguishable. WASHINGTON — Around 2:30 p.m. on Valentine’s Day, President Trump was in the study off the Oval Office when John F. Kelly, his chief of staff, arrived with news of a school shooting in Florida. Mr. Trump shook his head, according to an aide, and muttered, “Again.” Mark Barden was visiting a playground named for his 7-year-old son killed in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School when a friend texted him: Be careful watching television. It’s happening. Again. His senator, Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, heard about the Florida shooting while he was on his way to the Senate floor and ripped up his speech to declare that through inaction, “we are responsible” for a mass atrocity. Again. Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the Republican whip and gun rights supporter who was himself grievously wounded last year when a man opened fire at a congressional baseball practice, huddled with colleagues on the House floor, reliving his horror. He knew what was coming: the activists who in his view would exploit tragedies like his to advance their anti-gun agenda. Again.  Within hours of the blood bath in Parkland, Fla., where 17 students and adults were killed on Feb. 14, the machinery of the American gun debate began grinding into motion.  By evening, one anti-gun group had mobilized and already sent out its first email: “RESOURCES + EXPERTS AVAILABLE: Florida High School Shooting.” Another group, Everytown for Gun Safety, founded and financed by Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, activated the 1,500 members of its “survivors network,” and soon paid $230,000 for an advertisement in The New York Times shaming pro-gun lawmakers. The National Rifle Association followed its own playbook: remaining silent for several days — a recognition that its message might be unwelcome during the initial burst of grief. But it used its NRATV channel to argue to its members that more guns in schools could prevent massacres. Sales of so-called bump stocks, which can make a semiautomatic weapon fire like an automatic, rose out of fear that they would be banned. The battles waged after shootings in Newtown, Conn.; Orlando, Fla.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex., began playing out all over, presumably heading toward the same stalemate. But this time, a few things are different: The gun control side has developed a well-financed infrastructure that did not exist when Mr. Barden’s son Daniel and other schoolchildren were fatally shot at Sandy Hook. Within days of the Parkland shooting, one anti-gun group flooded Florida lawmakers with 2,500 calls and 1,700 emails opposing a bill allowing guns in schools. Another difference is an unpredictable president who belongs to the National Rifle Association and promotes the N.R.A.-favored solution of arming trained teachers but has also embraced a couple of modest gun control measures opposed by gun rights groups. And perhaps most dramatically, the We-Call-B.S. teenagers of Florida have injected a passionate new energy into a stale debate, organizing demonstrations, flooding the Statehouse in Tallahassee, composing songs, creating protest signs, confronting politicians and taking to TV airwaves with an intensity and composure and power rarely seen in recent years. “The initial reaction was the same kind of sickened resignation — this is one of the worst ever, and this probably won’t be enough either,” said Matt Bennett, a founder of Third Way, a center-left advocacy group in Washington.  “What has changed since then is the kids and the extraordinary, galvanizing force they have become,” he added, interrupting an interview to take a call from his 17-year-old son, whose class was leaving school to march to the White House. “No one knows when we are going to hit a tipping point on this issue. We may have hit it — we don’t know. But if we did, it’s because of them.” Still, veterans of both sides said the fundamental dynamics of Washington have not changed. If President Barack Obama could not pass gun control in a Democratic-majority Senate in 2013, months after Sandy Hook, they said, it was unlikely that Mr. Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress would. The N.R.A. remains as potent as ever, and the debate resumes as Republicans head into a primary election season when many worry about challenges from the right. In December, the House passed a bill to bolster criminal background checks before gun purchases, but Republicans paired it with a provision requiring states to allow anyone to carry a concealed weapon if they are allowed to carry one in their home state, essentially making it a national right, anathema to Democrats, who have their own liberal base to satisfy. Gun rights advocates also plan to focus on the failure of the F.B.I. to pursue tips about the suspected Florida gunman, arguing that blame should be on the federal authorities, not the firearms. “We have seen breakdowns in existing laws,” Mr. Scalise said. “Before people talk about putting new laws on the books, when we find out that multiple laws on the books were not followed, that should be the first thing we figure out.” The rapid mobilization of the anti-gun movement is a phenomenon that has evolved with the emergence of lobbying groups filled with veteran political operatives and growing lists of supporters. By now they are used to it. “There’s something necessarily robotic about how an organization like ours, in a professional way, responds to a mass shooting,” said Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, a gun control group founded by Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman who was shot in the head in 2011. But the response has been an outpouring of support. Moms Demand Action, the grass-roots arm of Everytown, has 100,000 volunteers in every state, with an email list of four million. Since the Parkland shooting, the group has added 75,000 members. In Georgia, 1,500 people turned up Wednesday at the State Capitol to lobby for gun laws, compared with 160 last year. In Minnesota, the group had 16 RSVPs before the shooting for a meeting on Tuesday; 300 people attended.  “When Sandy Hook happened, the gun lobby was ready for us. They had been preparing for 20 years to take down those parents,” Mr. Murphy said, recalling that few Democratic lawmakers were willing to appear on television criticizing the N.R.A. “There was no anti-gun movement. It just didn’t exist.”      Now, he said, “there is an increasingly mature political movement that can combine with the unique moral authority of the kids.” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said each episode cracks the wall of resistance to new gun laws. “Each time you do think it’s a little different and people will move,” he said. “You have to believe it’s cumulative and you win more support. You win a vote here and there.” By last weekend, gun control groups were sending out fund-raising appeals. In recent days, some groups have begun quietly helping the students organize future activities, including a march on Washington on March 24 with hopes of drawing 500,000 people. On Wednesday night, a week after the shooting, Dana Loesch, the N.R.A. spokeswoman, offered the group’s first public defense of its position, enduring jeers at a CNN town hall-style meeting as she sought to focus attention away from broad new gun restrictions and toward preventing mentally ill people from buying weapons. “I don’t believe that this insane monster should have ever been able to obtain a firearm, ever,” she said. In the days after the shooting, Mr. Trump consulted advisers as well as Chris W. Cox, the N.R.A.’s chief lobbyist. The president called Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip, who was traveling in the Middle East, to discuss his bill with Mr. Murphy requiring states and federal agencies to report more often to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System offenses that would bar gun purchases. “These kids, they’re organizing, they want action,” an aide told Mr. Trump. “I want action, too,” he replied, according to another aide. “That’s why I ran for president.” At the request of Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, Mr. Trump called a girl wounded in the attack, and afterward, the call seemed to remain on his mind, as he kept bringing it up with aides. Last Friday, he visited a Florida hospital and met victims, a visit still on his mind when he had dinner Saturday night at his Mar-a-Lago estate with his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, his daughter-in-law Lara and the Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera. The president noted that the injuries he saw were more grisly than those portrayed in the movies. “He was definitely horrified by the severity, the savagery of those wounds that the children suffered,” Mr. Rivera recalled. “And he kept saying, ‘How do you recover from that?’”  Mr. Trump mentioned tightening background checks. “He brought up how absurd it is that someone can buy a gun even though they’re on the no-fly list,” Mr. Rivera said. Asked for his opinion, Mr. Rivera suggested raising the minimum age to buy an assault rifle to 21 from 18. Eric Trump, who like his brother is a big-game hunter, seemed to push back, noting that there are already more than 300 million guns in circulation in the United States, implying that new restrictions might be pointless. But the president, in defiance of the N.R.A., has since publicly embraced the age increase and ordered the Justice Department to develop regulations to ban bump stocks. By Thursday, Mr. Trump seemed to be following the lead of the N.R.A. again, talking enthusiastically of its proposal to arm highly trained teachers to fortify schools. Still, he has taken different views of gun laws before. In “The America We Deserve,” published in 2000 when he briefly ran for the Reform Party presidential nomination, Mr. Trump called both major parties extreme. “The Republicans walk the N.R.A. line and refuse even limited restrictions,” he wrote. “I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.” Mr. Trump owns guns and has had a concealed weapon permit since 2010. When he set out to win the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, he was pressed by voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to support gun rights, an experience that aides said hardened his views. He dropped support for an assault rifle ban. “I love the N.R.A.,” he declared. “I love the Second Amendment.” At the White House this week, Mr. Trump hosted an emotionally packed session with survivors of the Parkland shooting. Outside the White House, high school students from around the Washington area — including Mr. Bennett’s son  — gathered, carrying signs with slogans like “Abolish the N.R.A.” and calling for legislation. “No more waiting!” one student said into a microphone. Whether they change the outcome, the students have at least changed the debate. “It’s going to be traumatic for a long time,” said Mr. Scalise, speaking from experience. “The fact that they want to get more engaged and find out what they can do to help to prevent this, I think, is courageous.” Follow Peter Baker and Michael Shear on Twitter: @peterbakernyt @shearm.

National,186," By PATRICIA MAZZEIMARCH 5, 2018 MIAMI — One of the big questions facing Florida lawmakers after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School is whether schoolteachers ought to be allowed to carry weapons. Gov. Rick Scott argues that schools would not be safer with armed teachers. His fellow Republicans in the legislature, however, appear much more open to the idea. After a debate on the State Senate floor on Monday, Republican legislative leaders struck a compromise that would keep guns away from teachers, but keep guns in schools. How? By arming librarians, counselors and coaches. The Senate agreed to exempt only teachers who work full-time in the classroom from having weapons on campus. Everyone else — no matter how closely they also deal with students — could be eligible to carry.  A $67 million voluntary school “marshal” program would allow school superintendents to work with local sheriffs to train and arm designated personnel on campus. The restriction adopted on Monday would eliminate the “vast majority” of school staff from participating, said the sponsor of the legislation, Senator Bill Galvano, a Republican. His $400 million legislative package also contains funding for school safety and mental health programs, and numerous gun control measures opposed by the National Rifle Association. It now heads to the State House for approval.  But the legislation, written and advanced unusually quickly after last month’s deadly shooting in Parkland, Fla., would still bring more guns into schools in districts that opt into the marshal program. That was not among the far-reaching demands for gun control pushed by student activists after the shooting. However, lifting gun-free safe zones in schools has been a longtime goal of the N.R.A. “This is fulfilling part of the N.R.A.’s dream,” lamented Senator José Javier Rodríguez, a Democrat whose party is far outnumbered in the State Capitol. Still, not even Mr. Rodríguez could bring himself to vote against the amendment scaling back the marshal program. Not a single Democrat said “no” when Joe Negron, the Senate president, asked for a voice vote. The amendment, despite allowing for librarians, counselors and coaches to carry guns, was still the biggest concession Democrats got from Republicans on the legislation. Mr. Scott, Mr. Negron and House Speaker Richard Corcoran have made passing the gun package a priority before the annual legislative session ends on Friday. In the end, a majority of senators decided some action was better than none — even if the legislation is disliked by Democrats who oppose arming any school personnel, and by Republicans who oppose enacting any new gun restrictions. The legislation passed, 20-18, with three Democrats voting in favor, and six Republicans against.      “Do I think this bill goes far enough? No, I don’t,” Senator Lauren Book, a Democrat who voted in favor of the measure, said through tears after she recalled walking through the bloodied halls of Stoneman Douglas High. “But what I disagree with more is the idea to allow the great to be the enemy of the good.” In a statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Scott, who has advocated more police officers in schools, called the Senate’s amendment “a step in the right direction.” Monday’s debate began when Senator René García, a Republican, offered the amendment to prohibit teachers assigned full-time to the classroom from carrying weapons. The marshal program had been labeled the Coach Aaron Feis Guardian Program, after one of the Parkland victims. Senator Rodríguez read subsections of the state statute defining a classroom teacher and rattled off a list of educators who are not included: counselors, psychologists, librarians, media specialists, teacher’s aides, adjunct teachers. “The cafeteria person or the janitor,” Senator Audrey Gibson, a Democrat, later quipped.  Senator Gary Farmer, also a Democrat, asked about a scenario that is hardly unusual: a full-time classroom teacher who also coaches an athletic team, or heads an after-school club. Scott Beigel, a geography teacher killed at Stoneman Douglas High, also coached the girls’ cross-country team. “Would the person who is both teaching and coaching after school be excluded from the guardian program?” Mr. Farmer asked. Mr. García said it would be up to each school district to decide. Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.

National,187," By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS, AMY HARMON and JESS BIDGOODFEB. 16, 2018 From New Jersey to Kansas to Texas, the aftermath of the Florida high school shooting has turned the routine of going to class into a nerve-racking proposition, as schools have ordered new lockdown drills, beefed up security and in some cases closed down entirely. Since the killing of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday, teachers and administrators have been working to avoid a repeat in their own schools, while in many cases having to react to copycat threats or jittery nerves misinterpreting innocent sounds as approaching gunfire. There were metal detectors and bag checks at B.M.C. Durfee High School, in Fall River, Mass., on Friday morning, after an anonymous Snapchat post warned the school could turn into “Florida part 2.” In Nutley, N.J., the superintendent, Julie Glazer, shut down schools for all 4,100 students in the district after a parent reported seeing a video that included images of a student firing a gun and a school building. (The police said that there was no “imminent threat” and that the student was cooperating with them.)  “As both the superintendent of the Nutley Public Schools and as a parent, and because of the nature of the world in which we live, there was no other decision to be made,” the superintendent said in a statement.  Law enforcement officers have been busy rushing to schools. A Broward County deputy accidentally shot himself in the leg on Thursday while answering a mistaken report of a shooting in a school not far from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High. A community college south of Seattle that serves 17,000 students locked down its 80-acre campus on Friday morning as the police investigated reports of shots fired. No evidence of a shooting was found. Some of the incidents have led to arrests on charges that include making threats or false reports. Among those arrested: A 16-year-old student who, the local authorities said, got off a school bus in Macon County, N.C., threatened to return the next day and kill people, then mimed raking the area with gunfire; an 11-year-old girl in Davie, Fla., who was accused of leaving a note under an assistant principal’s door threatening to bring a gun to her middle school and kill people; and two high school students at Brooklyn Prospect Charter School who were accused of threatening on Snapchat to “gun down” their school, according to Sgt. Brendan Ryan of the New York Police Department. Threat or no, many schools ordered teachers to immediately practice lockdown drills. A teacher in Denver, Carlee Easton, said she moved items from a closet in her classroom “to make more space for 9-year-olds to hide.” A teacher in the Bronx, N.Y., Kaela Brundage, said she and her students practiced cramming into a bathroom, staying silent inside for five minutes. “A few students cried even though they knew it was just practice,” she wrote on Twitter. 
            When we practiced the drill, all 25 students and 4 teachers were able to lock the door, shove ourselves in the bathroom, and lock that door in about 20 seconds. We stayed inside for about 5 minutes, totally silent. A few students cried even though they knew it was just practice.         Mindful of the Florida shooting, administrators supplied Jennings Senior High School in Jennings, Mo., with portable metal detectors and wands to search for weapons at the championship basketball game being held Friday night, said Rhonda Key, the principal. Dr. Key said this would not be permanent. “We’re just doing this because it’s so fresh,” she said. “You don’t want to scare them,” Dr. Key said. “But when you talk about these things, you must also say there is a real world out there.” Some districts sent messages on Friday that parents found disconcerting. “We assure you that all rumors are being thoroughly investigated,” read one from the administration of the Haldane Central School District in Putnam County, N.Y. “At this moment, there is no credible threat to the district.”  “Needless to say, I am freaking out,” wrote one parent on Facebook. At Da Vinci Arts Middle School in Portland, Ore., a drama teacher, Nicole Accuardi, took a different tack after listening to the fear and sadness expressed by many of her students. During the day on Thursday, her 150 or so drama students cut out paper hearts and stuffed them in their pockets. At a routine end-of-day assembly, on Ms. Accuardi’s cue, they stood up, threw the hearts in the air and sang “You Are My Sunshine” to the surprise of the other teachers and students. Many joined in.      Many schools and districts have developed protocols for handling school shootings since 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 20 students and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. But those protocols would probably be revised, education officials said, with lessons learned from the latest shooting. “There has to be an autopsy to really understand what went wrong and what went well,” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said Friday. “I was really concerned the first day that there was too much self-congratulation by the pundits on TV. The first responders did an unbelievable job. The teachers did an unbelievable job. But kids were killed, people were killed.” For instance, she said, it appeared that despite a well-honed intruder plan, the suspect in the Parkland shooting, an expelled former student named Nikolas Cruz, may have been able to take advantage of his knowledge of dismissal procedures to slip into the school at the end of the day, according to the authorities. But Ms. Weingarten also cautioned about overreacting. Not every threat was equally serious, she said: “We have no idea these days what’s a Russian bot and what’s a copycat.” Some schools took pains to try to keep nerves calm. At Dysart High School in El Mirage, Ariz., the principal took extra steps to make sure students knew the previously scheduled drill on Thursday was, in fact, just a drill. The reminder was included in the morning announcements, and was reiterated on the public address system several times throughout the day, said Zachery Fountain, a district spokesman. Eureka High School in California postponed its drill that had been scheduled for Thursday, partly because officials were concerned about the mental state of students, said Fred Van Vleck, the district superintendent.  “We determined it was best to allow the teachers the time in the classroom to have the conversations with students, rather than running them through drills at this point,” he said. But across the country, other officials were on edge as rumors and hoaxes flew at broadband speed. In the East Texas school district of Redwater, the superintendent, Kelly Burns, said the schools would be closed Friday, “to address a rumor about a possible shooter.” In Topsham, Me., an elementary school was evacuated on Friday morning in response to a threat, following frenzied speculation about a different threat to the high school. “These are unsettling times. I too am a parent, and understand the fear and anxiety that school incidents generate,” Brad Smith, the superintendent, said in a statement on Friday. “We are pleased that neither situation proved to be as significant as initially reported.” In Kansas, the Atchison County sheriff’s office and the local school district declared a lockdown Friday while investigating a threat. The lockdown was quickly lifted, and the sheriff’s office said on Facebook, “We apologize for the panic this may have caused.” Reporting was contributed by Claudio Cabrera, Elizabeth A. Harris, Kirk Johnson, Mitch Smith Nikita Stewart and Daniel Victor.

Opinion,188," Supported by Letters To the Editor: In the 1950s and ’60s, when the Southern states remained committed to racial segregation, many of us marched and spoke out against this blight on our democracy. But marching wasn’t enough to end this abuse of African-Americans. Nor were court orders sufficient to overcome this national embarrassment. As the Kennedys and Lyndon B. Johnson understood, substantial change would come only with congressional action — not simply through marches and sermons, however essential they may have been, but by changing the laws of the land. The young people who are protesting today are the advanced wave of what must come next: gun control legislation that takes weapons meant for battlefields out of our schools, off the streets and away from disturbed individuals with no respect for human lives. And the way to achieve these legislative advances is through the ballot box. Every reasonable voter in this country should make a candidate’s position on gun control a test of his or her ballot. ROBERT DALLEK, WASHINGTON The writer is the historian and author of presidential biographies. To the Editor: Re “In Halls of Power, Gun Survivors Urge Action” (front page, Feb. 22): President Trump advocates arming some teachers with guns. When the SWAT teams enter the building, how will they know whom to shoot? I foresee a lot of innocent teachers losing their lives simply because they have a gun in their hands. But this is what bothers me even more: Will future teacher hirings be based on whether or not a person is willing to carry a firearm instead of on teaching ability? If so, it will not be long before we have a militia instructing our children instead of people who truly care about education and carry with them the tools to inspire and teach our next generation. Once again our children will be the losers and the National Rifle Association the winner. NANCY MCCAFFREYEAST MORICHES, N.Y. To the Editor: Re “Arm School Staff? No, Says Armed Educator Who Held a Gunman at Bay” (news article, Feb. 22): It was a relief to see Joel Myrick, a gun owner, former assistant principal and the subject of your article, speak out against arming school staff members. Research shows that the presence of a gun makes a tense situation more likely to be deadly. I have been teaching high school for 17 years; we have no shortage of tense situations. The risk of an unintentional shooting is unacceptably high, and my students are extremely uneasy with the notion that their teachers could be carrying loaded weapons. Training civilians to have both the skill and the judgment to shoot an intruder is unreasonable. Can we ask a teacher to make the split-second decision to shoot and kill another person, possibly a student he has known for years? My colleagues and I did not enter education for this. Arming school staff members is not the solution to this problem, and I applaud Mr. Myrick for saying so. Common-sense gun laws are what we need. REBECCA JACOBSENPENNINGTON, N.J.

To the Editor: Re “I Can’t Stop Mass Shooters,” by Amy Barnhorst (Op-Ed, Feb. 21): As a psychiatrist practicing for many decades, I have long understood the problems that stop mental health professionals from effectively preventing angry, hating young men from using automatic weapons to murder large numbers of young people whom they both envy and hate. Dr. Barnhorst has described her experience as an emergency psychiatrist so clearly that anyone who reads her article should be able to comprehend why reliance upon psychiatrists and other mental health workers to prevent future occurrence of mass murders is unrealistic. As she demonstrates, it may be easy as a psychiatrist to hospitalize and treat a delusional patient experiencing command hallucinations, but this isn’t the case with the kind of raging young man intent on revenge against those he blames for his outsider misery. Dr. Barnhorst’s article is an example of a psychiatrist successfully educating the public and her colleagues in psychiatry about the limitations of concentrating on mental illness as the cause of mass murders.

To the Editor: Re “Dubious Theories on Shooting in Florida Find an Audience” (news article, Feb. 21): As pediatricians, who devote our careers to taking care of children, we are appalled by the conspiracy theories, vitriol and slander being directed at the teenage student survivors of the shooting in Parkland, Fla. These adolescents are grieving the loss of their friends; they have witnessed violence that will stay with them the rest of their lives; and they are now respectfully raising their voices to seek change after a tragedy. We stand in support of them. As pediatricians who have responded to crisis events, including mass casualty events in schools, we know firsthand that these children need and deserve to feel safe, and to trust that those they rely on are here to help them recover.

Washington,190," By KATIE ROGERSFEB. 26, 2018 WASHINGTON — In rare public remarks on Monday, the first lady, Melania Trump, voiced support for the student-led demonstrations that have unfolded after a school shooting left 17 dead in Parkland, Fla., many of which have called for gun restrictions her husband has resisted. “I have been heartened to see children across this country using their voices to speak out and try to create change,” Mrs. Trump said. “They’re our future and they deserve a voice.” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a briefing on Monday that the president also supported the student protesters. “That’s the reason why he had a number of them here at the White House just last week,” Ms. Sanders said.  Mrs. Trump’s remarks were delivered at the White House to about two dozen spouses of governors visiting Washington to meet with President Trump. At just over three minutes, the remarks amounted to a lengthy speech for a first lady who has not offered more than a few public words in months, and spent much of the winter shielding herself and her 11-year-old son, Barron, from view.  Mrs. Trump, who recently traveled with her husband to Florida to meet with two victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, was light on details but voiced a willingness to address school safety and the opioid epidemic. “As a parent, I cannot imagine the kind of grief and tragedy like that brings,” Mrs. Trump told the governors’ spouses, who had gathered in the Blue Room for lunch on Monday. Many of the students have called for more restrictive gun control measures than Mr. Trump and most congressional Republicans have been willing to endorse. Their push has resulted in tense moments with lawmakers, as when students heatedly questioned Senator Marco Rubio of Florida last week at a forum and one survivor tearfully pleaded with Mr. Trump at the White House last week to ban weapons like the one used in the Parkland shooting.      The East Wing has not unveiled a significant policy initiative, but Mrs. Trump recently hired a policy director who could push any nascent plans forward. In the past, Mrs. Trump has given few clues as to where she may focus her efforts, but she has also publicly expressed interest in helping children affected by the opioid crisis, advocating anti-bullying measures and aiding disaster relief efforts. On Monday, shortly after reflecting on the Parkland shooting, Mrs. Trump said adults should take responsibility for monitoring children’s behavior on social media. “As I have said before, it is important that, as adults, we take the lead and the responsibility in helping our children manage the many issues they are facing today,” she said. “This means encouraging positive habits with social media and technology, even limiting time online and understanding the content they are exposed to on a daily basis.” In recent days, students with connections to the shooting have called for Mrs. Trump to take action on her past remarks about combating cyberbullying. Lauren Hogg, the younger sister of David Hogg, one of the most outspoken of the Parkland students, said her family had received death threats since Mr. Trump’s oldest son, Donald Jr., appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory about her brother on Twitter. “Hey @FLOTUS you say that your mission as first lady is to stop cyber bullying,” Ms. Hogg wrote, “well then, don’t you think it would have been smart to have a convo with your step-son @DonaldJTrumpJr before he liked a post about a false conspiracy theory which in turn put a target on my back.” As she closed her speech, Mrs. Trump told members of her audience that the East Wing would reach out in the near future “as we travel the country and work to promote and fight for the well-being of our children.”  The White House did not provide details about what those plans would entail. “It just means that as she is cultivating these relationships with political spouses, she wants to work with them on issues that they all care about — children,” Mrs. Trump’s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said in an email.

Washington,191," By KATIE ROGERSFEB. 19, 2018 WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump signaled on Monday that he was willing to join a discussion on gun restrictions amid the national outcry led by teenagers who survived last week’s mass shooting at a Florida high school. Mr. Trump is open to improvements in federal background checks for prospective gun buyers, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement. She said the president had also spoken on Friday to Senator John Cornyn of Texas about legislation to revamp the system that the senator helped introduce last fall. The White House stopped short of backing the bill, but the statement was a departure for a president who has focused on the mental health of gunmen and suspects, rather than the firearms used in the attacks, after other mass shootings. “While discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered,” Ms. Sanders said, “the president is supportive of efforts to improve the federal background check system.”  The proposed legislation — introduced by Mr. Cornyn, three other Republicans and four Democrats in the Senate — would make significant changes to the national instant criminal background check system. The bill would hold federal agencies accountable for failing to add relevant information. It would also establish an initiative to better monitor gun buyers with records of domestic abuse.  The bill was also backed by the National Rifle Association, which spent tens of millions of dollars on supporting Mr. Trump in the presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton. But the legislation would have done little to stop the shooting last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people. The suspect, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, had no criminal record. He bought at least seven guns legally, including an AK-47 he had purchased in the past month, a federal law enforcement official said on Monday. Mr. Cruz, who has confessed to investigators, appeared on Monday in a Fort Lauderdale courtroom in shackles and a red jumpsuit as lawyers argued over whether a defense motion filed last week should be kept confidential. Mr. Cruz did not look up during the brief hearing. Several other Republicans have expressed a willingness since the shooting to discuss a change in gun laws, though they have given few specifics. On Monday, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida announced he would hold meetings with state and local leaders, focusing on ways to improve school safety, expand mental health care and keep guns out of the hands of people with mental illness. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio said on Sunday that some “small steps” should be taken on gun control, addressing background checks and mental illness. Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont said in a statement that his administration would review its procedures and policies on gun safety. Neither suggested that change was imminent. Their remarks recalled other murmurings of change that ultimately fizzled. Congress has been marked by intransigence on gun legislation, including a failure last year to ban so-called bump stocks, an accessory that the gunman in the October shooting in Las Vegas used to transform his semiautomatic rifles to mimic automatic weapon fire. That shooting left 58 people dead and wounded hundreds. Students from Parkland and across the country have organized protests and marches to urge Mr. Trump and lawmakers to act. About 100 people gathered in front of the White House on Monday to rally for stricter gun control. Seventeen students, representing the number of people killed in Florida, lay on the ground in protest. Parents, teachers and friends joined them on the pavement, and high school students stood in clusters in 40-degree temperatures, chanting “Enough is enough!” and waving signs that read “Am I next?”      “I’ve been afraid to go to school since the shooting in Florida,” said Maya Galanti, a 12-year-old from Bethesda, Md., who attended the rally with her mother and two siblings. “Those students thought they were having a normal day, and we have the same chances of getting shot as they did.”  Students from the Parkland area have also lashed out at Mr. Trump on Twitter, and some were incensed when he suggested in a tweet that the shooting had occurred because the F.B.I.’s resources had been diverted to the Russia investigation. “Seventeen innocent people were brutally murdered at my school, a place where they should have felt safe,” one student wrote. “Their lives were gone in an instant. You are the president of the United States, and you have the audacity to put this on Russia as an excuse.” The legislation last fall was considered a modest step toward a bipartisan compromise on gun safety. The lead senators behind the bill — Mr. Cornyn and Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut — have seen some of the worst mass shootings in United States history unfold in their states. A shooting that killed 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 came near the start of Mr. Murphy’s time in office, and gun restrictions became a defining issue for him. The shooting deaths of over two dozen people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., in November prompted Mr. Cornyn to be a co-sponsor of the bill. After the Texas shooting, Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked the F.B.I. to conduct an extensive review of the database because, as he said in a statement at the time, “relevant information may not be getting reported.” In a tweet on Monday, Mr. Murphy said that the bill alone would do little to stop the what he called an “epidemic” of violence. The president, who has spoken favorably about gun rights over the years, has held wavering views on gun restrictions. He had a concealed weapon permit in New York when Rudolph W. Giuliani was mayor, but it is not clear whether he maintained it. In 2000, as he considered an earlier run for president, Mr. Trump wrote in his book “The America We Deserve” that “I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.” He added, “With today’s internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record.” In 2016 on CNN, Mr. Trump said guns should not be allowed in classrooms, and then followed up moments later by saying that some teachers should have access to firearms.  “You look at some of our schools, unbelievable what’s going on, but I’m not advocating guns in the classroom,” Mr. Trump said at the time. “Remember in some cases, a lot of people admit this, trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms.” Reporting was contributed by Patricia Mazzei from New York; Neil Reisner from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and Ali Watkins and Emily Baumgaertner from Washington.

National,192," By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.FEB. 15, 2018 For the latest on the Florida school shooting, read Friday’s live updates. Newtown. San Bernardino. Las Vegas. Sutherland Springs. And now, Parkland. Five of the six deadliest mass shootings of the past six years in the United States. In each of them, the gunman had an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle. The N.R.A. calls the AR-15 the most popular rifle in America. The carnage in Florida on Wednesday that left at least 17 dead seemed to confirm that the rifle and its variants have also become the weapons of choice for mass killers. It is not hard to see why. Originally designed for troops to kill enemy fighters, the weapon became the military’s M16 and the shorter M4 carbine.  It was easily adapted for civilian use, with one major difference: Military versions can fire fully automatically — or in bursts of several shots — by depressing the trigger once. The civilian semiautomatic version requires a pull of the trigger for each shot.  But other features that make the AR-15 so deadly on the battlefield remain. It is light, easy to hold and easy to fire, with a limited recoil. Bullets fly out of the muzzle more than twice as fast as most handgun rounds. Equally important for a gunman looking to do a lot of damage in a hurry: AR-15-style weapons are fed with box magazines that can be swapped out quickly. The standard magazine holds 30 rounds. Equipped in this way, a gunman can fire more than a hundred rounds in minutes. The man accused of the killings in Parkland had “countless magazines” for his AR-15, the local sheriff said. And there is still one more reason the weapons are so popular in states like Florida: They are very easy to buy — and for a 19-year-old like Nikolas Cruz, the shooting suspect, far easier to obtain than a handgun. Florida has a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases. But anyone without a felony record, domestic abuse conviction, or a handful of other exceptions — such as a commitment to a mental institution — can walk into a gun store, wait a few minutes to clear a background check, and walk out with an AR-15 -style rifle, magazines and ammunition. Under federal law, you also must be 21 to buy a handgun from a firearms dealer. But 18-year-olds can buy semiautomatic rifles. The AR-15 rifle used in the attack was purchased legally, at Sunrise Tactical Supply in Florida, according to a federal law enforcement official. “No laws were violated in the procurement of this weapon,” said Peter J. Forcelli, the special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Miami. The AR-15 assault rifle, and others like it, is commonly used in mass shootings in the United States. Here's a closer look at likely reasons. Congress explicitly banned AR-15s and other semiautomatic rifles that fit its definition of assault weapons from 1994 to 2004.  Since that law expired 14 years ago, in most states it has been just as easy to buy an AR-15-style gun as it is in Florida. (Buyers can also purchase the weapon in person or online from private sellers who are not required to perform a background check — an exemption known as the “gun show loophole.”) Only New York, California, Washington, D.C., and five other states have their own assault-weapon bans, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Washington, D.C., and eight states also limit the large capacity magazines that have made many mass shootings so deadly. Even so, there have been efforts to circumvent the bans, legally and illegally, by making minor changes to the weapons.      “These guns are much more deadly than traditional bolt-action rifles or traditional shotguns, but they are regulated the same way” in most of the country, said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel of the Giffords center. Among the six deadliest mass shootings in the last six years, the only one not carried out with an AR-15 style rifle was the Orlando nightclub attack two years ago that left 49 dead. The gunman, Omar Mateen, had a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle, which shares features with the AR-15, though it functions via a different semiautomatic design — and is just as deadly. All of these military-style semiautomatic weapons have something else in common. They have been heavily marketed as home-defense and marksmanship weapons, and their sales have been a major driver of profits for gun manufacturers over the past two decades. “Americans own about five million AR-15s and it should go without saying that virtually all AR-15s are never misused,” a post on an N.R.A. website said a few years ago, describing home protection and shooting competitions as among the ways the guns “are used by good people for perfectly good reasons.” The industry also now calls these weapons “modern sporting rifles.” Gun organizations detest the label “assault rifle,” even though the federal legislation that enacted the decade-long ban specifically described the AR-15 and similar models as assault weapons. (The “AR” in the name, however, does not stand for assault rifle — it actually stands for ArmaLite rifle, reflecting the name of its original manufacturer.)  Paradoxically, the industry has boomed when under threat of new regulations, as buyers made new purchases because they feared additional ownership limits were about to be imposed. For similar reasons, the election of Donald J. Trump helped clobber the share prices of some gun makers, as fears of new restrictions eased. The publicly traded gun makers Sturm, Ruger & Company and American Outdoor Brands both lost about a quarter of their market value in the days after Mr. Trump’s victory. Earlier this week the Remington Outdoor Company, one of the country’s biggest and oldest gun manufacturers, said it would seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection amid plunging sales and mounting losses.

Washington,193," By ERICA L. GREENMARCH 13, 2018 WASHINGTON — After a gunman marauded through Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last month, conservative commentators — looking for a culprit — seized on an unlikely target: an Obama-era guidance document that sought to rein in the suspensions and expulsions of minority students. Black students have never been the perpetrators of the mass shootings that have shocked the nation’s conscience nor have minority schools been the targets. But the argument went that any relaxation of disciplinary efforts could let a killer slip through the cracks. And this week, President Trump made the connection, announcing that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will lead a school safety commission charged in part with examining the “repeal of the Obama administration’s ‘Rethink School Discipline’ policies.” To civil rights groups, connecting an action to help minority students with mass killings in suburban schools smacked of burdening black children with a largely white scourge.  “Yet again, the Trump administration, faced with a domestic crisis, has responded by creating a commission to study an unrelated issue in order to ultimately advance a discriminatory and partisan goal,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, the president and director-counsel at NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc.  “School shootings are a grave and preventable problem, but rescinding the school discipline guidance is not the answer,” she said. “Repealing the guidance will not stop the next school shooter, but it will ensure that thousands more students of color are unnecessarily ushered into the school-to-prison pipeline.” The issue of the Obama-era discipline guidance was raised formally by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who, after seeing a flurry of conservative news media reports, wrote a letter to Ms. DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions questioning whether the guidance allowed the shooting suspect, Nikolas Cruz, to evade law enforcement and carry out the massacre at Stoneman Douglas High. It was, on its face, an odd point: Mr. Cruz is white, and far from evading school disciplinary procedures, he had been expelled from Stoneman Douglas. “The overarching goals of the 2014 directive to mitigate the school-to-prison pipeline, reduce suspensions and expulsions, and to prevent racially biased discipline are laudable and should be explored,” Mr. Rubio wrote, asking that the guidance be revised. “However, any policy seeking to achieve these goals requires basic common sense and an understanding that failure to report troubled students, like Cruz, to law enforcement can have dangerous repercussions.” Broward County educators and advocates saw Mr. Rubio’s letter as an indictment of a program called Promise, which the county instituted in 2013 — one year before the Obama guidance was issued — and has guided its discipline reforms to reduce student-based arrests in Broward County, where Stoneman Douglas is. The N.A.A.C.P. said that Mr. Rubio “notably backs away from raising the purchase age for assault-style rifles and restricting magazine capacity,” and instead focuses on a system that once sent one million minority students to Florida jails for “simple and routine discipline issues ranging from talking back to teachers to schoolyard scuffles.” The program was praised by former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, and echoes the goals of the 2014 Obama guidance in discouraging schools from using law enforcement as a first line of defense for low-level offenses.  In the days before making his request, Mr. Rubio released a proposal that he said would remedy lapses in the  Promise program and the 2014 guidance.  In a tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Rubio noted that the gunman was not in the Promise program, but had displayed violent and threatening behavior. “The more we learn, the more it appears the problem is not the program or the DOE guidance itself, but the way it is being applied,” Mr. Rubio said, referring to the Education Department. “It may have created a culture discourages referral to law enforcement even in egregious cases like the #Parkland shooter.” Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.     Long before the attack in Parkland, Fla., the 2014 discipline guidelines, which encouraged schools to examine their discipline disparities and to take stock of discriminatory policies, were already on Ms. DeVos’s radar — but not because they were seen as a possible culprit in the next school shooting. Conservatives were using the Trump administration’s effort to rein in federal overreach to reverse policies designed to protect against what the Obama administration had seen as discriminatory practices. The “Rethink Discipline,” package that Mr. Trump’s commission will examine includes guidance that the Obama administration issued on the legal limitations on the use of restraints and seclusion, corporal punishment and equity for special education students. In recent months, educators and policy experts from across the country have traveled to Washington to voice support for and opposition to the disciplinary guidance, in private meetings with officials at the Education Department and in a series of public forums. At a briefing hosted by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, dozens of policy experts, researchers, educators and parents sounded off on the Obama-era discipline policy in a meeting that became so racially charged that some black attendees walked out. Since the discipline guidelines were issued, conservatives have blamed the document for creating unsafe educational environments by pressuring schools to keep suspension numbers down to meet racial quotas, even if it meant ignoring troubling and criminal behavior. Teachers who sought suspensions or expulsions of minority students were painted as racists, conservatives maintained.  “Evidence is mounting that efforts to fight the school-to-prison pipeline is creating a school climate catastrophe and has if anything put at-risk students at greater risk,” said Max Eden, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, who argued that teacher bias was not the driving force behind school discipline. But proponents argued that racial bias was well documented. When the guidance was issued, federal data found that African-American students without disabilities were more than three times as likely as their white peers without disabilities to be expelled or suspended, and that more than 50 percent of students who were involved in school-related arrests or who were referred to law enforcement were Hispanic or African-American. “Children’s safety also includes protection from oppression and bigotry and injustice,” Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles’s Civil Rights Project, wrote in testimony to the Civil Rights Commission. “Fear-mongering and rhetoric that criminalizes youth of color, children from poor families and children with disabilities should not be tolerated.” The Education and Justice Departments wrote in a 2014 Dear Colleague letter that discipline disparities could be caused by a range of factors, but the statistics in the federal data “are not explained by more frequent or more serious misbehavior by students of color.” The departments also noted that several civil rights investigations had verified that minority students were disciplined more harshly than their white peers for the same infractions. “In short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem,” the guidance said. In recent months, Ms. DeVos has said change will be coming. She has already moved to rescind a regulation that protects against racial disparities in special education placements. Her goal, she said last month, was to be “sensitive to all of the parties involved.” In a bruising interview on “60 Minutes” on Sunday, Ms. DeVos said that the disproportionate discipline issue “comes down to individual kids.” She declined to say whether she believed that black students disciplined more harshly for the same infraction were the victims of institutional racism. “We’re studying it carefully and are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments,” she said. Ms. DeVos’s office for civil rights also announced that it would scale back the scope of investigations, reversing an approach taken under the Obama administration to conduct exhaustive reviews of school districts’ practices and data when a discrimination complaint was filed.  But Ms. DeVos’s own administration has continued to find racial disparities. In November, the Education Department found that the Loleta Union Elementary School District in California doled out harsher treatment to Native American students than their white peers. For example, a Native American student received a one-day out-of-school suspension for slapping another student on the way to the bus, in what was that student’s first disciplinary referral of the year. A white student received lunch detention for slapping two students on the same day — the student’s fifth and sixth referrals that year. While Mr. Cruz was repeatedly kicked out of class and ultimately expelled, it is unclear whether he was ever referred to the police for his behavior in school. However, Mr. Cruz was known to law enforcement, which never found cause to arrest him, and a report of troublesome behavior to the F.B.I. went unheeded. The Broward County superintendent, Robert Runcie, said that Mr. Rubio’s effort to connect the district’s discipline policies to the Stoneman Douglas shooting was misguided. “We’re not going to dismantle a program that’s been successful in the district because of false information that someone has put out there,” Mr. Runcie said on Twitter. “We will neither manage nor lead by rumors.” A version of this article appears in print on March 14, 2018, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Trump Points to Culprit in School Shootings, and It Isn’t Guns.

Opinion,194," Supported by By Timothy Egan Here’s a thought: The next politician to express sorrow over the slaughter of students at a school without offering any specific remedy should be run out of office, for cowardice and failure to protect American children. Here’s a prayer: Let us remember to hold that thought for at least seven months, to the next election. President Trump delivered 702 words to the nation Thursday on the murder of 17 kids in Parkland, Fla. — one of more than 150 school shootings over the last decade. Not once did he mention guns, or more specifically the semiautomatic rifle used by the mentally unstable white-supremacist teenager who entered a school with an AR-15. The president did order the flag lowered to half-staff. He should have run up a white flag of surrender. Along with a gutless majority in Congress, Trump is hiding behind the shield of “thoughts and prayers” while showing himself derelict of duty in failing to defend the lives of school children. “You have people who care about you, who love you, and who will do anything at all to protect you,” said Trump, in addressing the children of America. That is a flat-out lie, which is chewing gum to Trump. If the adults were really willing to take any measure to protect them, Trump wouldn’t have signed a bill last year making it easier for mentally ill people to get guns. If the “people who care about you” really wanted to ensure your safety, they wouldn’t have led a filibuster in the Senate, as Mitch McConnell did in 2013, to prevent an expansion of simple background checks for purchasers of firearms. If those “who love you” wanted to show that love, they would say something more than the platitudinous mush that came out of the mouth of the do-nothing House speaker, Paul Ryan, whose response to the latest mass killing was, “I think we need to pray.” Since 1995, there have been more than 4,000 instances of someone rising in Congress to express “thoughts and prayers.” And since that time, about seven children or teenagers have been killed, on average, every day by guns. Trump, McConnell, Ryan — they all have children of their own. But in their roles as protectors of many other children, who should be free to attend school without fear of being shot, this trio that controls the federal government is leading a bad parent caucus. The kids know it — they get that people who should be looking after them are looking the other way. After Trump spoke, a sophomore at the Parkland school stated the obvious in an interview with CNN. “There’s no reason that a kid 19 years old that’s been investigated already, and not even a year ago, being able to purchase an AR-15,” said Isabella Gomez. The gun used in Florida is similar to the kind of rapid-firing weapons used to mow down first graders in Newtown, club-goers in Orlando, civil servants in San Bernardino, and music-lovers in Las Vegas. In our country, a nation with a gun homicide rate 49 times higher than other wealthy countries, lunatics have easy and legal access to these guns. The cops know the politicians are failing the kids as well. “What about the rights of these students?” said the Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, in relaying the grim news of the latest massacre. “Don’t they have the right to be protected by the United States government, to the best of our ability?” Of course they do. But the government will not protect them. The invertebrates in Congress and the soulless blowhard in the White House will not take even the most common-sensical measures to limit the use of militarized weapons by deeply troubled people. Remember the outrage over bump stocks, the modification used by the man who killed 58 people in Las Vegas last fall? If you don’t, please remember it next November, at the ballot box. Congress has done nothing on this issue, but many states are moving on it, pressed by popular movements unafraid of the gun lobby. Other countries act to protect their people, which is the most elemental duty of governance. After Australia suffered the deadliest mass shooting in its history, a massacre of 35 people in 1996 by a man with a semiautomatic rifle, the country banned such weapons. There hasn’t been a mass shooting since. Let me try another take for you bad parents in office. Pretend you live in a pleasant, well-protected community of like-minded people, and you’re in charge. O.K., you don’t have to pretend. And let’s say there was a natural gas leak every three days in one of the homes in that community, a leak that killed entire families. Your response would be to pray and do nothing. Or to pray and talk about everything except the gas leak. Or to pray and say you’re powerless to act because the gas company owns you. The response of those suffering would be to take control and kick you out. That’s what we have to do, and will, next November. I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@nytegan).

Washington,195," By MICHAEL D. SHEARFEB. 21, 2018 WASHINGTON — Senator Marco Rubio and a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association were repeatedly heckled at a nationally televised forum on Wednesday night in Florida after they refused to back new gun control measures. The spokeswoman for the N.R.A., Dana Loesch, offering the group’s first public comments after a shooting last week at a Florida high school, strongly defended the gun advocacy group’s positions in front of students and teachers from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. “People who are crazy should not be able to get firearms,” she said, insisting that enforcement of mental health laws, not new gun restrictions, would prevent future massacres. Mr. Rubio, Republican of Florida, also drew the ire of the crowd for refusing to support a ban on assault weapons and for saying that he intended to continue accepting money from the N.R.A. and other groups that support his pro-gun agenda.  Ms. Loesch and Mr. Rubio appeared during the two-hour forum, broadcast on CNN from a site near Stoneman Douglas in Parkland, Fla., knowing full well that they would be assailed by the gathering of people directly affected by the mass shooting last week.  President Trump and Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, both declined invitations to participate in the town hall-style meeting. The father of a 14-year-old girl who was killed at Stoneman Douglas angrily lectured Mr. Rubio for his refusal to support gun control legislation. The father, Fred Guttenberg, demanded that Mr. Rubio explain his opposition to a ban on the kind of assault weapon that the gunman at the school used to shoot his daughter, Jaime. “My daughter, running down the hallway, was shot in the back with an assault weapon, the weapon of choice,” Mr. Guttenberg said during the forum as Mr. Rubio stood stone-faced. “It is too easy to get. It is a weapon of war. The fact that you can’t stand with everybody else in this room and say that, I’m sorry.” The room erupted in applause for Mr. Guttenberg and repeatedly booed as Mr. Rubio sought to explain his opposition to a proposed assault weapons ban. The bill, he said, is riddled with loopholes that would make it easy for criminals to get around. “First, you have to define what it is. It basically bans 220 specific models of gun,” Mr. Rubio said, prompting applause from the audience. He continued, saying that the bill also allows for “2,000 other types” of guns that operate the same way but are not classified as assault weapons.  Ms. Loesch repeatedly deflected questions about restrictions on the availability of guns, insisting instead that keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill or people with criminal records would keep students safe. “I don’t believe that this insane monster should have ever been able to obtain a firearm, ever,” Ms. Loesch told Emma González, a senior at the high school. “None of us support people who are crazy, who are a danger to themselves, who are a danger to others, getting their hands on a firearm.” But her answers prompted angry taunts from the audience. At times, Ms. Loesch struggled to answer, but she steadfastly refused to back down on the N.R.A.’s position opposing new gun restrictions. She said the group opposed raising the legal age for purchasing an assault weapon to 21 from 18, an idea that Mr. Trump had earlier signaled support for. Students who are old enough to serve in the military should be allowed to own firearms, she said. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     Diane Wolk Rogers, a history teacher at Stoneman Douglas, confronted Ms. Loesch by asking her to defend the idea that allowing the suspect in the shooting, a 19-year-old, to own an assault rifle represents “a well-regulated militia” as is written in the Second Amendment. Ms. Loesch said the phrase was meant to protect the rights of anyone who “could operate and service their firearm,” an answer that drew loud yelling and more boos from the audience. Mr. Rubio, for his part, had offered opening remarks that he clearly hoped would deflect criticism during the event. He expressed grief for those who were affected by the shooting, but he said that people in the United States needed to find ways to disagree “without accusing one another of being evil people.” But the audience, including Mr. Guttenberg, did not hold back in criticizing Mr. Rubio’s position on gun control. Mr. Guttenberg repeatedly asked whether Mr. Rubio believed that “guns were the factor in the hunting of our kids.”  The senator said he agreed, but he insisted that other types of laws would better prevent such attacks. He said that he would support a bill to increase the minimum age for the purchase of an assault weapon to 21 from 18. And he said that he backed improvements to background checks and a ban on so-called bump stocks, which can convert semiautomatic weapons to fire automatically. Students and teachers at the forum on Wednesday also had questions for Florida’s other politicians, including two Democrats, Senator Bill Nelson and Representative Ted Deutch. One young student talked about how her best friend was killed in front of her, and she asked Mr. Nelson about background checks, and how to improve them. Another student, whose brother died in the shooting, bluntly said to Mr. Deutch that “my friends and I are worried that we are going to be murdered in our classrooms.” He asked what Mr. Deutch was going to do about it. “As a starter,” the congressman said, “I’m going to introduce legislation to make sure that assault weapons are illegal in every part of this country.” The audience burst into applause. But Mr. Rubio, who ran for president in 2016, was repeatedly challenged on his positions on gun control and his willingness to accept donations from the N.R.A. The issue of donations was raised by a junior at Stoneman Douglas who stood just feet from the senator and asked him whether he would renounce money from the gun advocacy group in the future. When Mr. Rubio refused, the audience booed loudly. “People buy into my agenda, and I do support the Second Amendment,” Mr. Rubio said, repeatedly refusing to say he would stop accepting money from the group. “The influence of these groups comes not from money, the influence comes from the millions of people who support the agenda.”  Mr. Deutch at one point engaged in a brief debate with Mr. Rubio, saying that a gun allowing someone to fire off 150 rounds in six to seven minutes “should be banned.” Later, Chris Grady, a student at the high school, thanked Mr. Rubio for appearing at the forum, unlike Mr. Trump and Mr. Scott. “A lot more than can be said for our so-called president and governor,” Mr. Grady told Mr. Rubio. “We need you and your colleagues on both sides to come together with us and find a compromise if we are ever to solve this epidemic.” Mr. Grady asked the senator whether he supported legislation to limit high-capacity magazines that allow weapons to fire many bullets quickly. Mr. Rubio said that he had long opposed such legislation, but was now reconsidering that position. The senator said that there could be evidence from the Florida school shooting that suggested the gunman might have killed fewer people if he did not have high-capacity magazines. “It wouldn’t have prevented the attack, but it would have made it less lethal,” Mr. Rubio said.

Metro,196," By LISA W. FODERAROFEB. 20, 2018 KENT, N.Y. — It was a small-town raffle intended to raise money for the local fire department here, with a Windham AR-15 semiautomatic rifle as one of the prizes. But after the high school shooting rampage last week in Parkland, Fla., the fund-raiser suddenly took on much larger implications, and thrust the town, about 50 miles north of New York City, into the national debate over gun control. The debate occurred in New York, a true-blue state with some of the most restrictive gun laws in the nation. But there are broad swaths of New York — indeed, most of the state — where hunting is a favorite pastime and gun enthusiasts are proud members of the community. This town of 13,000 in Putnam County is one of them. The raffle, planned before the Florida shooting, had seemed like a good idea to the organizers. The 40-member Kent Volunteer Fire Department had struck out with previous fund-raisers, from a pancake breakfast to sales of T-shirts and chocolate-covered pretzels. None sold like hot cakes, especially the breakfast, which drew three families.  But the $20 raffle tickets for a 20-gauge shotgun and an AR-15, a semiautomatic weapon similar to the ones used in recent mass shootings, were a different story.  “This has been the most successful fund-raiser we have ever done,” said Gladys Bolbrock, a firefighter and president of the volunteer department. “We have been selling tickets for over a month. We put our heads together and found something that people wanted, that they were interested in it. We have hunters everywhere.” But the Florida shooting suddenly cast the raffle in a new light and parents protested. Some firefighters dug in their heels, vowing to proceed with the fund-raiser. It all came to a head over the last two days, culminating in an angry meeting of the fire district on Monday night, in which parents turned out in force. In different parts of the nation, guns have been a popular raffle item — even, or perhaps especially, AR-15s. A group of elementary schoolchildren in Missouri has received national attention for raffling an AR-15 weapon to raise money for their baseball team, while a suburb in Sacramento, Calif., has apologized for including an AR-15 rifle at a fund-raiser over the weekend for its fire department. New York State enacted stringent gun-control measures after the massacre in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. It imposed universal background checks, created a database of people who are dangerously mentally ill and banned the sale of certain assault weapons, as well as magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds. The AR-15 that the Kent fire department was raffling off complied with New York State law. Semiautomatic weapons like the AR-15 can still be sold with 10-round magazines in New York as long as they do not include some key features, including a pistol grip, a muzzle flash suppressor and a collapsible stock. An employee at Precision Armory, a firearms store in nearby Carmel, said that the stripped-down AR-15 was favored for target practice and also hunting nuisance animals. “It’s very good for coyotes and stuff like that,” said the employee, who asked that his name be withheld since his shop did not sell the weapons to the fire department.      Ms. Bolbrock of the fire department said the meeting on Monday became heated. “There was shouting,” she said. “There were people talking over people. There were mothers saying they were worried about their children.” On Tuesday afternoon, the fire department had a slight change of heart: It decided to award gift certificates, in the value of the two guns, from a local gun shop, rather than the guns themselves.  The department’s about-face was so sudden that Andy Irvin, the local schools superintendent, had not heard about it until he was informed by The New York Times. “I’m thrilled they are changing the prize,” said Mr. Irvin, who oversees the Carmel Central School District, which draws 4,400 students from Kent and neighboring towns. “And I would have said that three weeks ago. I’m just angry that it’s only now that these conversations have ramped back up to the level they have. I still don’t understand how it fell off the radar after Newtown.” He said he was disappointed that New York State continued to allow the sale of a semiautomatic like the simplified AR-15. “I don’t think there is any room for semiautomatic weapons,” he said. “To me, whether it’s semiautomatic or assault, nothing that falls into those categories should be legitimate. Once you buy it legally, the modifications can be done by anybody. I guarantee you there are YouTube videos.” At a bustling shopping center in Kent on Tuesday afternoon, a flag still flew at half-staff in honor of the victims in Parkland, Fla., across the street at the public elementary school. Interviews with a half-dozen residents who were dropping off children at a karate class, or buying doughnuts and coffee, revealed a cross-section of opinion. Few people were willing to share their name, regardless of their views, including a mother with a young child in tow who said she was infuriated by the gun raffle. But Bill Ercoli, a home contractor who has never owned a gun, thought the fire department was within its right to raffle an AR-15. “I’m not a gun advocate and all, but it’s a matter of rights,” he said. “Why don’t you take my car away too, since cars kill people every day.” In a statement explaining its decision, Ms. Bolbrock said that the Kent fire department “recognizes that this is a sensitive time,” adding that “our hearts are out to everyone affected” by the Florida shooting. “We are cooperating with the community,” she said, “and we are hoping to move on from here.” An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the replacement raffle prizes. The new prizes are gift certificates from a gun shop — in the value of the two guns that were to be raffled off — not the cash value of the guns.

Opinion,197," Supported by By David Leonhardt This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Vermont has some of the weakest gun laws in the country. After the school shooting in Florida last week, Vermont’s governor — Phil Scott, a Republican — initially vowed that those laws would remain the same. But then he changed his mind. He changed it just one day after his initial response. Why? In the meantime, an 18-year-old from Poultney, Vt. — a small town in the southwestern part of the state — was arrested for allegedly planning yet another school shooting. “If we are at a point when we put our kids on a bus and send them to school without being able to guarantee their safety, who are we?” Scott said, according to Seven Days, a Vermont publication. “I need to be open-minded, objective and at least consider anything that will protect our kids.” The governor’s about-face may be only words, but it’s still encouraging. And encouragement is important. I fully understand the instinct to despair about guns: Kids keep dying, and things never seem to change. But the only way they will change is if people outraged by gun violence resist despair. “This world-weary prediction of inaction is pernicious,” ProPublica’s Alec MacGillis wrote this weekend, in a perceptive mini-essay on Twitter. “It demoralizes those who are actually motivated to fight against gun violence. And it lets off the hook those who are opposed to reform.” MacGillis continued: “The NRA’s influence depends heavily on the PERCEPTION of its power. By building up the gun lobby as an indomitable force, pessimistic liberals are playing directly into its hands.” Among the reasons for hope: • The courageous — and deeply political — response of many Florida survivors, which felt different from any previous response. “The people in the government who are voted into power are lying to us,” Emma González, a senior at the Parkland, Fla., high school that was attacked, said at a rally this weekend. “And us kids seem to be the only ones who notice and are prepared to call B.S.” (Christine Yared, a freshman at the school, has an Op-ed in The Times.) • Inspired by that response, the movement to reduce gun violence seems to have a new energy, driven by students — who of course have provided much of the energy for previous political movements. Individual schools have already held or planned walkouts. A nationwide protest is scheduled for March 14, with help from organizers of the Women’s March. Teachers are also talking about mass protest, as Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick explains. • The share of Americans who own guns has fallen to its lowest level in almost 40 years: to 36 percent recently, from 51 percent in 1978. That, as MacGillis notes, “limits the voting power of the gun lobby.” • State policy is a flawed way to regulate guns, since they can obviously cross state lines. But recent state changes nonetheless make the case for gun-safety laws. In Missouri, which recently repealed background checks for gun purchases, violence is up. In Connecticut, which passed tough laws after the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, gun violence is down. Finally, if you have any doubt about the stakes here, I encourage you to look at the chart that ran with my column this week. It compares the overall child mortality rate across 10 high-income countries. The United States just isn’t trying as hard as every other rich country to keep its children alive. The value of disagreement. “On the left, there has been some outrage at conservative voices on the Times Op-ed pages,” my colleague Nick Kristof writes. “But as a progressive myself, steeped in the liberal worldview, I must say that I often learn a lot — however painfully — from these conservatives with whom I utterly disagree, partly because they gleefully seize upon inconvenient facts that my side tends to ignore because they don’t fit our narrative.” Nick concludes his column with this: “It should be possible both to believe deeply in the rightness of one’s own cause and to hear out the other side. Civility is not a sign of weakness, but of civilization.” You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook. I am also writing a daily email newsletter and invite you to subscribe.

Business,198," By MICHAEL CORKERY and TIFFANY HSUFEB. 16, 2018 As the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., stokes the national debate over firearms, it may be easy to overlook another major development in the gun world this week. One of the nation’s oldest and largest gun makers, Remington, said it was nearing a bankruptcy filing. Hit with slumping sales and unable to sell itself, Remington has negotiated a deal with its lenders to cut its debt and keep operating. Other gun makers are also struggling. Colt completed its trip through bankruptcy last year, while sales and profits at Smith & Wesson’s parent company have plummeted and its stock price is sagging. All three companies make a version of the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle, which was used by the killer in Parkland on Wednesday and is the weapon of choice for mass shootings.  The problems demonstrate the paradoxical and tumultuous nature of the gun industry. It has prospered when the prospect of tighter regulations induces people to buy more guns.  And it slumps when that threat of new regulation subsides, as it has done during the Trump administration. President Trump, who has called himself a “true friend and champion” of guns, did not mention gun control in his remarks on Thursday about the Parkland shooting. And many leaders in the Republican-controlled Congress, where gun restrictions have withered over the years, have shown no change of heart in light of this week’s school shooting. “When people feared there would be increased gun regulation, they went out and bought more guns,” said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, who covers the gun manufacturers. Firearm background checks, often used as a proxy for firearm sales (for which data is not readily available), fell farther last year than they had before.

Similarly, the number of background checks swung up more than 43 percent after the shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015 and nearly 40 percent after the massacre in Orlando six months later. But that trend has reversed since Mr. Trump has been in office. In October, when a gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas and injured hundreds, background checks slumped, falling 13 percent from the same month a year earlier. Over all, background checks tumbled more than 8 percent last year, the largest fall since the F.B.I. began keeping track in 1998. “There is no panic buying of guns because there is clearly no threat of federal government action in response to mass shootings that would restrict or regulate firearms,” Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, wrote in an email. “The gun lobby can’t scare their followers into thinking Donald Trump would sign any piece of gun control legislation as they could under an Obama presidency.” Remington, founded in upstate New York by Eliphalet Remington II in 1816, is the oldest manufacturer of rifles and shotguns in the country.  DuPont, the chemical company, bought a majority share in Remington in 1933, purchased the firearms maker outright in 1980 and then sold it to an investment firm in New York in 1993. The private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management bought the company in 2007 for $118 million and rolled it up with other gun manufacturers into a conglomerate called Freedom Group. Under Cerberus, the company enjoyed years of expanding gun sales. In 2012, the number of guns made in the United States totaled 8.5 million, more than double the 3.3 million that were produced a decade earlier. But in December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and killed 20 children and six adults. When the authorities reported that the gunman had used an AR-15-style rifle made by Remington, public anger focused on the manufacturer. Large investors, like the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, began taking steps to divest from the gun maker. Cerberus said it would seek to sell the company. Despite the public outcry, the fallout from Sandy Hook helped the company’s bottom line. Spurred by calls that gun controls were imminent, buyers purchased more Remington firearms, and sales surged 36 percent, to $1.3 billion in 2013, Moody’s said. Some investors may have had objections to Remington, but not everyone. After the Sandy Hook shooting, Remington was able to borrow millions more as gun production boomed, particularly heading into the 2016 presidential election because Hillary Clinton was expected to win and push for tighter gun controls.      The company borrowed $12.5 million from the City of Huntsville, Ala., in 2014 to open up a new plant there. The city has agreed to eventually forgive the loan if Remington meets hiring targets over a number of years, said Chip Cherry, chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Huntsville and Madison County. Remington also borrowed $175 million to buy out investors that wanted to divest. (Remington has paid out a total of $48 million, according to a company filing.) The company does not disclose its lenders, but an analysis by Morningstar shows that some of Remington’s debt is held in funds managed by JPMorgan Chase. Oppenheimer, the large mutual fund company, also owned some of the bonds issued by Remington, but said it sold its debt holdings last year.  In 2017, Mr. Trump’s first year in office, sales fell 27 percent in the first nine months (the most recent data available) from the same period a year earlier. After production was ramped up in expectation of a Clinton presidency, gun inventories have piled up. On Monday, Remington announced that its lenders had agreed to cut its $948 million debt load by $700 million in exchange for an ownership stake in the company. Analysts said at the time that even with its lower debt, the company still faced a challenging sales environment. But this week, things are looking up to some on Wall Street. The price of Remington’s bonds have increased more than 16 percent since Wednesday — a sign that some investors believe the company has promise.

Washington,199," By LINDA QIU and JUSTIN BANKFEB. 23, 2018 WASHINGTON — Since last week’s deadly shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., a pitched national conversation about gun policy has dominated town hall meetings, a White House summit meeting, the annual Conservative Political Action Conference and the never-ending stream of social media feeds. Below is a brief review of several laws governing guns in the United States and how effective those policies have been in curbing violence. Some of the toughest laws that regulate the production, distribution and use of firearms in the United States were passed after major acts of violence. ■ The National Firearms Act of 1934 was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt after high-profile gangland crimes, including the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre in 1929 that killed seven in Chicago. The law imposed a $200 tax on transfers of machine guns, short-barrel rifles and shotguns, and it required gun owners to register those weapons.  At the time, the tax was “considered quite severe and adequate” to discourage or eliminate sales of those guns, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It still stands at $200 — even though its current value, after adjusting for inflation, would come to about $3,700.  ■ The Gun Control Act of 1968 was passed after the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. It banned interstate mail orders of all firearms, interstate handgun sales and weapons with no “sporting purpose.” It prohibited the sale of firearms to minors, felons, fugitives, drug addicts and those committed to a mental institution. And it required gun manufacturers and dealers to be licensed and maintain records of sales. ■ After an intense lobbying effort by gun advocates, the Firearms Owners’ Protection Act of 1986 lifted some of those restrictions. The 1986 law allowed dealers to sell rifles and shotguns through the mail, and it limited federal inspections of gun dealers. It also prohibited the sale of machine guns manufactured after May 19, 1986.   We will not publish your contact information. It will only be used by our journalists to contact you.

And you agree to our Terms of Service. Thank you for your submission. ■ The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 further amended the 1968 law: It required gun purchasers not already licensed to possess a firearm to undergo background checks when buying from sellers licensed by the federal government. However, private transactions were exempted, creating the so-called gun-show loophole. ■ The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned the possession, transfer or domestic manufacturing of some semiautomatic assault weapons for 10 years. Known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, it expired in 2004, despite efforts by gun control advocates to extend it. ■ In 2008, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act after a shooting at  Virginia Tech a year earlier had killed 33. The law created a series of incentives and systems — but not requirements — for states to share information with the federal government about people who have been disqualified from obtaining guns. Eight states have enacted some kind of ban on assault weapons. Two other states regulate military-grade firearms. State gun laws are tracked, in detail, by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which lobbies for gun control. According to the law center, states with the strictest gun control measures have the lowest rates of gun-related deaths. Those states include California, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. Conversely, states that do not aggressively regulate guns — like Alabama, Alaska and Louisiana — have the highest. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     Still, as Lisa Foderaro and Kristin Hussey have reported for The New York Times, “Cities like Chicago and Baltimore, with rigorous gun laws, also have two of the highest murder rates in the country. The black market for illegal guns has thrived in those cities, with gang members and criminals turning to the streets to get firearms.”  Some state gun control laws have come under court review. In one prominent case, the Supreme Court limited gun control efforts in its 2009 ruling District of Columbia v. Heller. Since then, however, the United States’ highest court has opted to not consider other Second Amendment cases, including in 2016, when it declined to hear challenges to bans on assault weapons in Connecticut and New York. Those state laws were passed after 20 first graders and six adults were killed in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. In choosing to not hear those cases, “the justices have given at least tacit approval to broad gun control laws in states and localities that choose to enact them,” wrote Adam Liptak, the legal affairs correspondent for The Times. It’s difficult to directly link declines in crime or gun violence to any specific law, given the limited scope and loopholes in each one, according to experts and research. The National Rifle Association has “successfully built in ineffectiveness” to gun control legislation, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.” “Part of the story is that the N.R.A. fights tooth and nail against any policy,” Mr. Winkler said. “The laws that result are much less ambitious in their goals.” The gun control laws had some effect. The 1934 restrictions curbed access to machine guns; crimes with those types of fully automatic firearms have essentially dried up since the era of Al Capone. The 1968 prohibitions on who can own a weapon, and requirements for licensing dealers, are still in place.  The 1994 ban on assault weapons has become a particular and recent subject of intense debate. The N.R.A. has cited a 2004 analysis funded by the  Justice Department to argue that the “ban could not be credited with any reduction in crime.” On the other hand, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has claimed in a Twitter post that “the number of gun massacres fell by 37%” while the ban was in place. Christopher Koper, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and the lead author of the study that is cited by the N.R.A., has repeatedly said that the ban had mixed effects and final results would not be immediately evident. “My work is often cited in misleading ways that don’t give the full picture,” Mr. Koper said Thursday in an email. “These laws can modestly reduce shootings overall” and reduce the number and severity of mass shootings. Ms. Feinstein’s claim that the ban drastically reduced gun massacres comes from analysis by Louis Klarevas, a lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Boston. But Mr. Winkler noted that most mass shootings are committed with a handgun, not a military-grade assault weapon. “There’s no anti-mass shooting law to test,” said Charles Branas, the chairman of the epidemiology department at the School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York. “In terms of all of these instances, not just mass shootings, we need the politicians to create more laws to test.” Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.

National,200," By VIVIAN YEEFEB. 18, 2018 A child is shot to death. Maybe at school, maybe at the movies. It is all over TV, all over Twitter, just like the last mass shooting. Then the cameras go away, and the parents are left in a wilderness of heartbreak. They do not know how to plan a funeral, where to get a therapist. They’re not aware that scammers will try to fund-raise off their grief, that conspiracy theorists will question their tragedy, or that — hard to believe — they might, eventually, be O.K. But lots of people do know. “When we had this happen to us, had our daughter slaughtered, we didn’t know what to do, or what was going to happen next,” said Sandy Phillips, whose 24-year-old daughter, Jessica Ghawi, was one of the 12 killed in the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., in 2012. “We didn’t want to live. It was horrific. And nobody else understood, except other survivors.” So it is that Ms. Phillips and her husband, Lonnie Phillips, are raising money to travel to Parkland, Fla., where the Phillipses will quietly let the families of 17 of America’s latest victims of mass gun violence  know that they are there to listen, to advise, to hug, to cry, and, perhaps, to recruit them to the ranks of the most committed gun-control activists in the country.  The mass shootings of recent years, the proliferation of grief from rural Oregon to the tip of Florida, have forced hundreds of family members into an unwanted fellowship. Veterans like the Phillipses serve as guides in the immediate aftermath, introducing the bereaved of Sandy Hook to those of San Bernardino and the parents of Virginia Tech to those of Roseburg, in a loose but growing network.  Some mourn in private. Some confront politicians, join gun-control groups and flock to rallies. But whether they turn to advocacy or not, many gravitate toward one another, checking on each other by Facebook or phone whenever another gunman strikes. In a gun-control debate that often splinters along ideological lines, no one speaks more powerfully than those who survived a high-profile shooting, or the families of those who did not. The power of their testimonials goes beyond their authenticity: They, unlike politicians and advocates, can usually avoid the accusation that they are politicizing a tragedy. Recognizing the emotional heft of such stories, groups like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence  and Everytown for Gun Safety often make themselves available to survivors and victims’ families in the aftermath of mass shootings, sometimes even paying for them to travel to meet other survivors and advocates or to attend rallies, hearings and meetings with politicians. Everytown, the group founded and funded by the former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, runs a network of about 1,500 family members and shooting survivors who are trained in activism, including many who were affected not by mass shootings but by the smaller ones that occur daily. They join a long tradition of families who have turned private heartbreak into public advocacy. There is Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which has successfully shifted public awareness around drunken driving and pushed for tougher laws. There is John Walsh, who became a well-known anti-crime TV personality after his son was kidnapped and killed. There are the parents of people killed by undocumented immigrants, who have seen their campaign against illegal immigration taken up by President Trump. The difference is that mass-shooting survivors have yet to win any major victories on the federal level. So they do what they can, hoping that when the next mass shooting happens, more people will take to their cause. “The more people that are affected in some way, the more people care; yeah, that’s what it’s going to take,” said Jenna Yuille, whose 54-year-old mother, Cindy Yuille, was one of two people shot and killed at the Clackamas Town Center outside Portland, Ore., in December 2012. “It’s horrible, but that’s part of what it’s going to take.” Ms. Yuille’s mother died three days before the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in which 26 people were killed, 20 of them first graders. The gun-control debate was suddenly everywhere, and Ms. Yuille, encouraged by a friend, began to speak up. She testified in support of background-check legislation in Oregon and got involved with the Everytown Survivor Network. Ms. Yuille now works for Americans for Responsible Solutions, an advocacy group founded by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot outside an Arizona supermarket in 2011, and her husband, the retired astronaut, Capt. Mark E. Kelly.  At an Everytown training event in the spring of 2015, Ms. Yuille met Erica Lafferty, the daughter of one of the Newtown victims, Dawn Hochsprung, Sandy Hook’s principal. They were around the same age; their mothers had died three days apart. The connection was instantaneous. When they heard about the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Wednesday — Ms. Yuille in a text from her boyfriend, Ms. Lafferty when she glanced at CNN — Ms. Yuille texted Ms. Lafferty to check on her. They felt the same, they said: Tired. “Is it bad that we’re feeling so numb? Is it bad that I haven’t cried?” Ms. Lafferty asked Ms. Yuille on Friday, during a joint interview. “Because I haven’t.” “Same,” said Ms. Yuille, 29. “I know there are other people, especially in Oregon, that see me as a leader on this issue, and being a spokesperson on this issue, so I worry about that. I don’t want to let people down.” “Exactly,” said Ms. Lafferty, 32, who works for Everytown. “Like, if I slow down, am I going to disappoint anyone? Am I going to disappoint myself?” Many families, of course, do not want to be the faces of anything. They want to struggle in quiet, if not quite in peace. Some of the families of the Newtown victims have never spoken publicly about their ordeal. And some family members, Ms. Phillips said, continue to support gun rights. Soon after the Sandy Hook shooting, Mark Mattioli, whose son James was killed at the school, testified that legislators should focus on mental health support instead of gun control. He also spoke at a National Rifle Association news conference to praise the group’s school safety proposals. But a large and growing number of families who want gun laws strengthened have chosen to seize the platform the media offers in the wake of a shooting and never to relinquish it. One man who lost his son in the Columbine High School shooting almost two decades ago, Tom Mauser, is still deeply involved in gun-control efforts in Colorado.  “People who are affected in a personal way become lifelong dedicated volunteers to this,” said Robert Bowers Disney, the vice president for organizing at the Brady Campaign. “It just fundamentally changes people’s lives and experiences.” The Phillipses have been to the scene of almost every major shooting since their daughter died, usually letting local authorities and charitable organizations know that they are there if families need them. In Florida, they are planning to offer to connect the families of the teachers killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School to the daughter of a teacher killed at Columbine in 1999. “They may not be wanting to talk, but when you tell them, ‘I lost my daughter in the Aurora theater massacre,’ they’re like, ‘Oh … my God,’” Ms. Phillips said. “It’s that initial, ‘Oh, you get this.’” What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     They offer advice on grim matters like psychological treatment (you don’t need a grief counselor, they say; you need a trauma therapist) and how to fend off scammers who pretend to raise money for families, only to keep it for themselves. Increasingly, they have had to warn people about the online trolls who will inevitably inundate them with claims that the shooting was a government hoax. Some people take months to get in touch. Others, angry, want to talk about activism even before they bury their loved one. One man in Las Vegas who had lost his wife in the country music festival shooting knew no one else in town. So, while he waited for his wife’s body to be released, he turned to Lonnie and Sandy Phillips. They are still talking. One of the first people the Phillipses spoke to after beginning this work was Nicole Hockley, whose son, Dylan, was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary. Ms. Hockley waited a month to meet with the Phillipses, and even then, she wondered if it was too soon. “It can also be scary to potentially see your future self from a path that you didn’t choose,” she said. “But also knowing that other people have survived and have found ways to keep walking forward — that can help as well.”  Ms. Hockley, the co-director of the anti-gun-violence group Sandy Hook Promise, now tries to let the families of each successive wave of shooting victims know that they can lean on her for support when they are ready. She is careful to put aside her political agenda in those conversations, she said, not wanting to exploit their grief. Ms. Hockley heard about Wednesday’s Parkland shooting while on a work trip to Los Angeles. She crumbled as she learned that it was a school. By Thursday, she was on a plane to Florida.

National,201," By JULIE TURKEWITZ and ALEXANDER BURNSFEB. 21, 2018 One hundred Marjory Stoneman Douglas students traveled to Tallahassee to advocate for gun control. Survivors spoke to legislators while supporters protested across the country. TALLAHASSEE — Seven days after the killing of 17 students and school staff members in Florida, Republican state leaders are facing pressure unlike any they have experienced before to pass legislation addressing gun violence. On Wednesday, swarms of student protesters carrying signs and boxes of petitions stormed the Florida Capitol, pleading with lawmakers to pass tougher gun control in the wake of the deadly shooting at a Broward County school last week. On one floor, they crowded the doorway of the office of Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican and an ardent supporter of gun rights, shouting, “Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you!” On an upper floor, they gathered outside the office of the powerful speaker of the Florida House, Richard Corcoran. “Face us down! Face us down! Face us down!” And on the House floor, Alondra Gittelson, who survived the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, confronted Mr. Corcoran, a Republican, demanding to know why “such a destructive gun” — the AR-15 rifle — is widely accessible.  “How is an individual in society able to acquire such a gun?” Ms. Gittelson, 16, asked Mr. Corcoran.  Mr. Corcoran replied that he saw the rifle as a legitimate hunting weapon and did not believe a ban would help matters. “I’ll just be honest with you,” he said. “Me, personally — I don’t believe that’s the solution.” With about two weeks left in the legislative session, Republicans led by Mr. Scott have concluded that it would be politically catastrophic if they failed to do something to address the growing outcry. But they appear likely to pursue legislation narrower than what students are demanding, avoiding a ban on assault weapons. In the Florida House and Senate, lawmakers said they were involved in bipartisan efforts to craft gun-related legislative proposals that could be introduced Friday or earlier. State Senator Bill Galvano, a Republican, said in an interview that the Senate proposal would likely involve raising the age to purchase semiautomatic rifles to 21 from 18; introducing a three-day waiting period to purchase such guns; banning “bump stocks,” an attachment that enables a semiautomatic rifle to fire faster; and expanding the power of law enforcement to restrict the actions of mentally ill people under Florida’s Baker Act. “Nothing about this is par for the course,” Mr. Galvano said. “We’ve had one too many horrific incidents in this country and really around the world. And to have this tragedy occur here in the State of Florida has in some ways been very sobering.” He added that there was a “true commitment in the Senate and the House to try to address issues that would prevent something this devastating from ever happening again.” In addition to the students amassing in Tallahassee, Democrats in Florida have vowed to make gun control a central campaign issue in 2018, and a national gun-control group is already targeting Mr. Scott with television ads that say he neglected public safety.  The developing clash over firearms has the potential to define Florida politics in a critical election year, thrusting the state into the center of a stalemated national debate around gun violence and the Second Amendment. In a politically divided state where the National Rifle Association has held broad influence for decades — every governor for 20 years has been an ally of the group — even fierce supporters of gun rights now believe Republicans cannot afford to seem passive in response to gruesome scenes of violence. The arrival of the student protesters from Stoneman Douglas, who traveled hundreds of miles by bus to the state capital, drastically raised the political stakes for Florida’s long-ruling Republicans. Having reached Tallahassee overnight, the young activists quickly set about advocating for sweeping new gun restrictions, included expanded background checks for gun purchases and an outright ban on the sale of military-style firearms. Inside the Capitol, the students divided into groups of 10. Senator Lauren Book, a Democrat, had helped the students arrange meetings with lawmakers in both parties, and the groups planned to meet with some 70 elected officials. Throughout the day, the Stoneman Douglas students moved through the labyrinthine building, and met for 20 or 30 minutes at a time with lawmakers in their offices. They crowded around small conference tables and packed onto leather couches or sat cross-legged on nubby carpets. Some lawmakers asked for photographs they could use for promotional materials. At least one, a Democrat, pulled students into a picture before even introducing himself. Group No. 6 crammed into the elevator with two parent chaperones. They met with Representative Patricia H. Williams, a Democrat, and Senator Debbie Mayfield, a Republican. Ms. Mayfield said that changes were needed, perhaps including raising the minimum age to buy powerful weapons, but she rebuffed criticism from a student, Daniel Bishop, 16, that such a change would not actually prevent deaths.      “We can’t stop crazies,” she told the group. Afterward, Amanda De La Cruz, 16, looked distraught. “I want the ban on semiautomatic weapons,” she said. “I don’t care about the crazies.” Will Weatherford, a former speaker of the Florida House, said on Tuesday that the ferocious public response to the Parkland shooting exposed pent-up feelings of horror and fear that have mounted over time. Mr. Weatherford, a conservative Republican, said legislators might be able to move quickly on a few tailored proposals, such as raising the legal age for possessing assault rifles. “With Pulse, with what took place in Las Vegas, there’s been an aggregate effect,” Mr. Weatherford said, referring to the mass killings in 2016 and 2017 at an Orlando nightclub and an outdoor concert in Las Vegas. “All of it is adding up and there’s a lot of frustration that’s boiling over.”  Mr. Weatherford said he expected the Legislature to take action of some kind, but cautioned: “It’s hard to write a thoughtful policy in three weeks.” Proponents of stricter gun control, however, seem unlikely to be appeased by what they perceive as half-measures. Students at the Capitol Wednesday denounced the Legislature for having voted down a proposal on Tuesday to consider banning assault weapons. “The people around us failed us,” declared Delaney Tarr, a student at Stoneman Douglas. “And if they continue to fail us, then they will no longer be in office because soon we will have the ability to vote, and we will vote them out.” The mood in the Capitol grew progressively more contentious throughout the day, as respectful disagreements between students and lawmakers gave way to blunt expressions of indignation by frustrated activists. By the afternoon, the Stoneman Douglas students had been joined by thousands of other Floridians, including college students, who had come to voice their support for changes to gun laws. The revival of gun regulation as a political issue comes at a precarious moment in Florida politics, as a polarizing president warps traditional political boundaries in a state he narrowly won in 2016. Republicans in Florida have experienced several setbacks recently in special elections, as traditionally Republican-friendly voters have deserted the party in heavily suburban and Hispanic areas. Representative Stephanie Murphy, a Democrat from the Orlando area, said voters in her largely suburban district had reached a breaking point. “People are angry and they’re outraged and they’re motivated,” said Ms. Murphy, who defeated an N.R.A.-backed candidate after the Pulse shooting in 2016. This year, control of Florida’s governorship, the State Senate, several congressional seats and a United States Senate seat are expected to be intensely contested. The growing pressure on Florida Republicans may reflect the changing national contours of the gun debate, which for years has been shaped chiefly by ardent supporters of the Second Amendment who vote in force. While several Democratic-leaning states, like Connecticut and Colorado, passed ambitious gun-violence laws after mass shootings, no state wholly controlled by Republicans has enacted legislation even on the comparatively modest scale currently being contemplated in Florida. As a matter of electoral politics, the Republican with the most at stake may be Mr. Scott, a wealthy former hospital executive who is closely aligned with the N.R.A. Mr. Scott has been moving to challenge Senator Bill Nelson, a long-serving Democrat who supports gun control, and the governor’s political allies believe passing some form of public-safety legislation is essential to his prospects in the race.  A commercial blasting Mr. Scott for rejecting “policies that could keep Florida children safe” was released this week by Giffords, a gun control group founded by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot outside an Arizona supermarket in 2011, and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly. The Stoneman Douglas students saved their final meeting on Wednesday — a two-hour sit-down to which the press was not invited — with Mr. Scott. Afterward, one student, Piero Guerra, 15, said the governor had been “kind of neutral” on their proposal to ban semiautomatic rifles but had been “adamant” in support of mental health reforms. The meeting with the governor ended after dark, and Mr. Guerra and his classmates headed for the three buses that would take them some eight hours home to Parkland. Lindsey Salomone, 15, said that after a day speaking with lawmakers — she sat next to the governor during their meeting — she was ready to go home and do the real work: grieve. “I was in the building; my friends were shot in my class,” she said. “So emotionally, I’m pretty much in shock. I’m not feeling anything, actually.” She added, “But everybody is telling me: It will come.” Jess Bidgood and Patricia Mazzei contributed reporting.

Foreign,202," By ISABEL KERSHNERFEB. 20, 2018 JERUSALEM — Nir Barkat, the mayor of Jerusalem, knows a thing or two about taking on assailants. A former Israeli paratrooper with combat experience, he packs a Glock 23 semiautomatic pistol as a civilian. In 2015, after a series of stabbings in the city by Palestinians, Mr. Barkat urged Israelis with licensed firearms to carry them at all times, saying they should think of it “like military reserve duty.” In Israel, armed guards stand outside movie theaters and shopping malls, and off-duty soldiers go to the beach or the bar with an M-16 slung over their shoulders. The seeming availability of guns, savvy intelligence gathering and the can-do, tough-guy image of Israelis like Mr. Barkat have impressed some American gun-rights advocates. Indeed, after some of the most horrifying school shootings in the United States, gun-rights supporters like Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, and Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, have cited Israel as a potential model.  In fact, contrary to the advocates’ arguments for more guns, Israel has strict gun control. Those citizens who are licensed to own a personal weapon have generally undergone some military training. Guns are not seen as a hobby, but as a tool for self-defense, and if necessary, to help protect others from terrorism. And while Israel has sophisticated policing and intelligence aimed at stopping terrorism, it has little experience with the kinds of civilian mass shootings that have become the source of anguished debate in the United States.  Even Mr. Barkat, who once told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that Americans could benefit from armed civilians and “smart” profiling, sees a big difference. “There’s no misuse of rifles and guns in Israel,” Mr. Barkat said. “On the contrary, they give extra measures, extra security.” That, he said, was “exactly the opposite” of what was happening in the United States. The issue came to the fore again last week. Mr. Huckabee was visiting Israel when a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla. On Twitter, he said that Israel had “pretty much eliminated” school shootings by “placing highly trained people strategically to spot the one common thread — not the weapon, but a person with intent.” After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., in which 28 people were killed, Mr. LaPierre praised Israel for placing armed guards at schools. “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” he said. A 2012 study by Janet E. Rosenbaum, an epidemiologist at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, examined the perception of many gun-rights advocates that Israel and Switzerland were “gun utopias” that had fairly permissive firearms laws and widespread gun ownership, and encouraged armed civilians to intercept shooters. She found that gun ownership was in fact far lower in Israel than in the United States. In the United States there are roughly 310 million firearms in the hands of civilians, nearly one for every adult and child. In Israel — which has a population of about 8.5 million, not counting about 5 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza — about 135,000 citizens are currently licensed to own guns. Of those, 37,500 work as guards, according to the Ministry of Public Security, which issues the permits. The United States considers handgun ownership a constitutionally protected right, while Israel considers gun permits a privilege, granted by the Ministry of Public Security strictly on the basis of need.  It is true that Israelis tend to exhibit more comfort with firearms than, say, civilians in countries like Germany and Japan, where handguns are almost impossible to obtain. Most Jewish Israelis are conscripted for mandatory military service at 18 for a period of at least two years, and receive at least some formal firearms training. Soldiers are issued guns only for their period of service. “As we are a people’s army, a lot of the population has at least undergone basic training and knows how to handle and conduct themselves with a weapon,” said Simon Perry, a criminologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “We don’t have a gun fetish here,” he added. Israelis who have completed military service or national service may apply for a gun license at 21; others must wait until 27. Those who are eligible include civilians who live or work in areas considered dangerous; people working in security and emergency services or as civilian security guards; and some farmers, tour guides, veterinarians and registered hunters.      Applicants must go through background checks and need a signed bill of health from their doctor. Gun licenses have to be renewed every three years, and require an annual practice at a shooting range. Many requests are refused. A majority of the licenses are granted for 9 mm pistols. The few licenses for automatic rifles are reserved for people who need them for ongoing security roles. Annual bullet supplies are limited to 50 per licensed individual, or 100 for security guards. The gun death rate in Israel is low by international standards: about two homicides per 100,000 people in Israel, according to Arye Rattner, a criminologist at the University of Haifa. Some years in the United States the rate has been four or five times higher. “I would say that for many males, especially, military service serves as a kind of catharsis for their aggressive emotions, therefore much less of it is being expressed in civilian circles,” Dr. Rattner said. Civilians who carry licensed guns are expected to use them if confronted with a dangerous situation, but “only if in a life-threatening situation can they open fire,” said Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman.  Israel has had horrific experiences with gun violence, but nearly all of them in the context of political violence. Yigal Amir, the right-wing extremist who assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, did so with a licensed gun. There have also been occasional nationalist attacks against Palestinians by armed Israelis, such as the massacre perpetrated by Baruch Goldstein in Hebron in 1994 with an army-issued automatic rifle. He was an officer in the reserves. Palestinian gunmen carried out deadly terrorist attacks on a school in Maalot, near the border with Lebanon, in 1974 and at a rabbinical seminary in 2008. But both attacks were in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Licensed commercial security firms guard schools; contrary to some perceptions, armed civilians have not been deployed as school guards on a large scale since the 1970s. At times, civilians have used guns to stop attacks. Last year, a tour guide was among those who opened fire at a Palestinian driver who plowed his truck into a group of soldiers in Jerusalem. But on other occasions, a civilian response has caused harm, as when a civilian guard shot an Eritrean asylum-seeker during a Palestinian attack at the Beersheba bus station in 2015, mistaking him for one of the assailants. And occasionally, Mr. Rosenfeld said, security guards had used their work-issued weapons to commit deadly acts of domestic violence, prompting new limits on taking weapons home. Amid the upsurge in Palestinian stabbings, shootings and car rammings that began in the fall of 2015, the Ministry of Public Security eased the criteria for obtaining a gun permit, but maintained the same levels of supervision and control. Among Israel’s Arab minority, which makes up more than 20 percent of the population, there is a proliferation of illegal weapons, mostly kept for self-protection or used for criminal purposes or in internal feuds. That has been worrying police and community leaders. In June 2017, Muhammad Barakeh, a then lawmaker and the chairman of the High Follow-Up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel, said after a week in which six Arab citizens were murdered, “There is no structured decision within the government and police to control crime on the Arab streets.” But he added, “We also bear responsibility internally regarding education, conflict resolution and more.” Earlier this month, a 17-year-old student was shot and wounded by masked men inside a school in the Arab town of Jaljulya in central Israel. Still, Israelis tend to reject any comparison with the United States. “We don’t worship guns, we don’t sell assault rifles to people, we don’t have a genius creation like the NRA, we don’t regard every bunch of guys a ‘well regulated militia’ and we’re pretty much done fighting the British,” Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat who has advised several foreign ministers and served as his country’s consul general in New York, wrote in a sarcastic tweet responding to Mr. Huckabee.

Express,203," Supported by Students used Twitter, the news media and a courthouse rally to pressure lawmakers for gun control after a deadly shooting at a Florida high school. By Julie Turkewitz, Matt Stevens and Jason M. Bailey FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — They shouted into a microphone until their voices became hoarse. They waved handmade signs. They chanted. And sometimes, in the middle of it all, they choked up. At the federal courthouse here on Saturday, students — including many of the very people who had to endure the trauma of a shooting on campus — continued to speak out about guns. Since Wednesday, when a gunman killed 14 students and three staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., their youthful voices have resonated where those of longtime politicians have largely fallen flat. And on Saturday, another young woman’s words captivated the nation. Speaking publicly at the rally, Emma González, a senior, pledged that her school would be the site of the nation’s last mass shooting. How could she know? Because, she said, she and her peers would take it upon themselves to “change the law.” “The people in the government who are voted into power are lying to us,” she said. “And us kids seem to be the only ones who notice and are prepared to call B.S.” “They say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence — we call B.S.!” she continued as a chorus of supporters echoed her. “They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun — we call B.S.! They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars — we call B.S.! They say that no laws could have been able to prevent the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred — we call B.S.! That us kids don’t know what we’re talking about, that we’re too young to understand how the government works — we call B.S.!” She wiped her eyes aggressively. Then, she urged the people in the crowd to register to vote — and to give their elected officials “a piece of your mind.” Just hours later, one video of the speech had been viewed more than 100,000 times.  In a telephone interview early Sunday, Ms. González, 18, said she was surprised by the enthusiastic reaction to her speech.  “I just got off the phone with Demi Lovato,” she said. “That’s not normally something that ever should have happened.”  Ms. González said she was encouraged to speak out, in part, by other supportive people in her community, especially those who she said do not yet feel comfortable talking publicly.  “This is my whole world now,” she said. “I cannot allow myself to stop talking about this.” A person Ms. González met at a party was killed in the shooting, she said; another person she has known for “an incredibly long time” is still in the hospital.  “Everybody needs to understand how we feel and what we went through, because if they don’t, they’re not going to be able to understand why we’re fighting for what we’re fighting for,” Ms. González said.  She noted that some have criticized students for raising their voices, suggesting that they take the time to grieve instead.  “This is the way I have to grieve,” Ms. González said. “I have to make sure that everybody knows that this isn’t something that is allowed to happen.”   Here are the voices of some other students who, like Ms. González, have spoken out in recent days.  While David Hogg, 17, and dozens of his Stoneman Douglas classmates were hiding in the dark in the school chef’s office, he interviewed them on camera about their views on gun policy. Mr. Hogg, a senior and the student news director, later told The New York Times that lawmakers must make schools safer. “We need to do something,” he said. “We need to get out there and be politically active. Congress needs to get over their political bias with each other and work toward saving children’s lives.” Referring to politicians, Mr. Hogg told CNN: “We’re children. You guys are the adults.” Hours after the mass shooting, surviving students turned to social media to discuss gun control. They addressed the prevalence of such attacks and why someone with a mental illness can buy a gun. “Guns give these disgusting people the ability to kill other human beings,” Carly Novell, a 17-year-old senior who is an editor for the school’s quarterly magazine, wrote on Twitter. “This IS about guns.” In a video interview with The Times, Ms. Novell said she was trying to use her anger fruitfully. “People always talk about gun control and how things need to change, but nothing ever does,” she said. “And that is so frustrating.” The public outcry from some Stoneman Douglas students was vastly different from the response of survivors of the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. Those students two decades ago did not turn to activism as they grieved. In contrast, Tyra Hemans, a senior at Stoneman Douglas, brought a poster featuring the word “ENOUGH” to a funeral for one of her classmates on Friday. She said she also wanted to deliver a message to President Trump. “I want our politicians to stop thinking about money and start thinking about all these lives we had lost,” she said. “I want to talk with him about changing these laws.” Among those who attended Saturday’s rally was Daniela Palacios, 16, a sophomore at another Broward County high school, Cypress Bay.  This was her first protest, she said, and she stood with her mother, a tiny gold cross on a chain around her neck.  Returning to school after the shooting at Stoneman Douglas had been difficult, she explained, and she said she was there to call for a ban on firearms like the semiautomatic AR-15 rifle used by the gunman. “Wherever you bump into someone, there is the fear that they’re the next shooter,” she said, “and every bell is a gunshot.” “I feel like some change is going to come of this,” she went on, her voice barely audible amid the roar of the crowd. “I feel hopeful.” When the protest ended, a group of teenagers stayed behind, chanting and hugging — and chanting again.  “It could have been us,” one sign read. “My friend died for what?” said another.  “No more guns! No more guns! No more guns!” they yelled. Among those leading the group was Ellie Branson, 16, a junior from South Broward High School. She wore a yellow and white T-shirt, her cheeks wet with tears. When the protest finally ended, she texted a reporter.  “Can you include the names of the victims?” she asked. “Their names are more important than mine.” Julie Turkewitz reported from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Matt Stevens and Jason M. Bailey from New York. Jack Begg contributed research.     Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS",2018-02-18,0.035418548,Sunday
Washington,204," By KATIE ROGERSFEB. 16, 2018 POMPANO BEACH, Fla. — President Trump made an unannounced visit on Friday to a hospital here to console victims of a school shooting in nearby Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest mass shootings of his presidency, before meeting with law enforcement officials. “It’s very sad something like that could happen,” a solemn Mr. Trump told reporters who had gathered at the hospital, Broward Health North. In his public remarks, the president focused on praising law enforcement officials and doctors; he hailed the speed of emergency medical workers as “record setting.” The president’s visit came as students at schools nationwide were on edge, and as an intense debate waged among lawmakers and public officials about gun restrictions. Criticism has also been directed at Mr. Trump, who has so far focused on the mental health of the suspect, Nikolas Cruz, rather than on Mr. Cruz’s access to an AR-15-style rifle that he had legally obtained at a gun shop.  While at the hospital, the president did not respond to a question about whether gun laws should change.  Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, accompanied him to Broward, where they paid tribute to doctors and emergency workers for quickly moving people from the site of the shooting, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, to the medical facility, which took in eight victims. “The job they’ve done is incredible, and I want to congratulate you,” Mr. Trump said as he shook the hand of Dr. Igor Nichiporenko, a trauma surgeon at Broward.

After the hospital visit, Mr. Trump went to the Broward County Sheriff’s Office, where he was introduced to law enforcement officers. When the president met Officer Michael Leonard of the Coconut Creek Police Department, who captured the suspect, he said that Officer Leonard had played down his introduction. “That was so modest; I would have told it much differently,” Mr. Trump joked. “I would have said, ‘Without me, they never would have found him.’”      Arriving in Florida after a week of challenges directed at his administration, Mr. Trump appeared ready to charm a crowd and forget the troubles he left behind. He instructed the Broward sheriff to give his deputies “a raise,” but he did not address the chaos back in Washington, including reports that indictments had been filed against 13 Russians for meddling in the 2016 election. (He did post a message on Twitter as he left Washington: “The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!”)  The president also offered encouragement to a local F.B.I. agent at the sheriff’s office. “We had a lot of F.B.I. guys down here quickly,” Mr. Trump said. “So great job, thank you very much.” On Friday, F.B.I. officials acknowledged that they had not acted on a previous tip about the suspect. Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, who was also at the sheriff’s office, had earlier in the day called on the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, to resign over the episode. Meanwhile, Mrs. Trump, who has in recent weeks kept out of public view, praised the group of law enforcement officers. “Thank you all for what you do,” she told them, adding that children “are our future.” “Let’s take care of them,” she said, “because they will go through a lot.” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who said this week that gun restrictions would not have prevented the shooting, also made brief remarks. Mr. Rubio, who flew to Florida from Washington on Friday with the president, has asked Congress to investigate how the F.B.I. failed to act on a tip about the suspect. “This is a community and a state that is a deep pain, and they want action to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” Mr. Rubio said. “You can count on it,” the president responded.

Washington,205," By ALI WATKINS, JOHN ISMAY and THOMAS GIBBONS-NEFFMARCH 3, 2018 Here’s a look at how AR-15-style rifles and other firearms are marketed. Jeff Swarey bought his AR-15 rifle five years ago after shooting guns in video games. Jessie K. Fletcher, a former Marine sniper, was given one by his platoon after he stepped on a bomb in Afghanistan that blew off his legs. Jessica Dorantes, a Texas police officer, will not go on patrol without hers. Their shared communion is a firearm that has in recent decades become a staple of American gun culture. Its iconic silhouette is immediately recognizable — and polarizing. The AR-15 won its place in American culture through a confluence of circumstances, described in interviews by more than 15 gun industry professionals, hobbyists, lawyers and gun owners. They pointed to 2004, when the AR-15 re-entered the gun market after the end of the federal assault weapons ban, at a time of heightened interest in the military. It was popularized by the rise of a video game culture in which shooting became an accessible form of mass entertainment, and it was marketed as accessible and easy to personalize. For those who love the rifle, it is seen as a testament to freedom — a rite of passage shared between parents and children, a token to welcome soldiers home, a tradition shared with friends at the range. But in its relatively short life span, the AR-15 has also become inextricably linked with tragedy and has been vilified as the weapon of mass murder.  Nineteen-year-old Nikolas Cruz confessed to gunning down 17 people last month at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in which an AR-15 was used, the latest mass shooting to prompt a new round of the intractable gun debate.  Whether beloved or reviled, the AR-15 is more than just a gun for much of the United States. Light, precise and with little recoil, the Colt Armalite Rifle-15 Sporter hit the market in the early 1960s as the first civilian version of the military’s M16 rifle. What set it apart was, much like its military counterpart, the inventor Eugene Stoner’s patented gas operating system, which allowed for rapid fire and reloading. The weapon could easily handle a 20-round magazine, was easy to disassemble and was marketed, in one of Colt’s early advertisements, to hunters, campers and collectors. Billed as “America’s rifle” by the National Rifle Association, the AR-15 is less a specific weapon than a family of them. When Mr. Stoner’s rights to the gas system expired in 1977, it opened the way for dozens of weapons manufacturers to produce their own models, using the same technology. The term AR-15 has become a catchall that includes a variety of weapons that look and operate similarly, including the Remington Bushmaster, the Smith & Wesson M&P15 and the Springfield Armory Saint. Over the ensuing decades, as the American military modified the M16’s exterior to allow for accessories such as sights, grips and flashlights, the civilian market followed. Today, gun enthusiasts consider the AR-15 the Erector Set of firearms. Online message boards, video games and advertisements all provide how-to guides for customizing the rifle. But the guns were taken off shelves after President Bill Clinton signed a law in September 1994 banning what Congress called “assault weapons.” Prompted by a string of mass shootings — including one in 1989 in Stockton, Calif., in which five children were killed and 32 wounded in a schoolyard — the legislation stopped production of civilian rifles like the AR-15, and introduced the term “assault weapons” to the public. The number of assault weapons recovered by the police in crimes and reported to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives dropped sharply after the ban was carried out, according to a Justice Department report. But it stops short of directly tying the ban to a decrease in gun violence, and the ban’s broader effect remains in dispute. Gun rights advocates say loopholes allowed for the sale of slightly modified versions throughout the ban. Its defenders cite law enforcement statistics showing a drop in the criminal use of automatic and semiautomatic weapons during that time. The number of rifles manufactured in the United States has steadily increased since the ban ended through congressional inaction when the ban sunset in 2004, though it is not clear how many are semiautomatic firearms. Some 3.7 million rifles were manufactured in the United States in 2015, according to A.T.F. data.  Determining the true effect of the ban is all but impossible because federal regulations prohibit the government from tracking the guns. Though gun industry lobbyists touted the popularity of AR-15s, no public information is available on how many Americans own them, where they are bought or concentrated or exactly how many exist. Culturally, the ban did what marketers could not: In outlawing it, the government made the AR-15 tantalizing. “If you want to sell something to an American, just tell him that he can’t have it,” said Mark Westrom, who owned Armalite, the gun’s original manufacturer. When the ban ended, enthusiasts could finally buy what for a decade had been forbidden. And when the AR-15 reappeared in gun stores that fall, American culture had changed. Now, this civilian-model military rifle was being sold amid not only a swell of anticipation but also post-9/11 patriotism and at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Special Operations forces were being mythologized in news segments, shown carrying their rifles through the desert in imposing tactical gear. Children were shooting the AR-15’s military equivalent in wartime video games. Manufacturers designed rival versions, creating a competitive market that made the AR-15 more affordable.      “So you want to buy a rifle like our troops are using in Iraq?” National Public Radio asked in November 2004. “Well, step up to the counter and tell the man what you want.” Gun store owners scrambled to meet demand, contemporaneous news accounts show. Shops that historically sold traditional bolt-action guns and older firearms started stocking AR-15s. Steve Clark, whose family has owned Clark Brothers Gun Shop in Warrenton, Va., since 1956, said his customers are drawn to newer and more modern rifles. “If the whole world went to ARs, that’s what I’d be selling,” said Mr. Clark, who prefers older firearms for what he views as superior craftsmanship. “It would make me sad, but I’m going to sell them what they want.” AR-15 owners, asked why they bought the firearms, cited recreation as well as the larger mythology that has enveloped the rifle of embodying freedom and the Second Amendment.  Joshua Boston, a Marine who spent two deployments in Iraq and two in Afghanistan and owns several AR-15s, said he keeps them for personal defense. He is looking for the serial number of his old military rifle so he can engrave both it and the Colt logo onto the AR-15 he plans to give years from now to his son, now 11 months old. Chris Cerino, a former federal law enforcement officer and firearms instructor in Ohio, said he hated the AR-15, until he used one. “It was so fun to shoot,” said Mr. Cerino, 48. Now, he and his wife, who has a purple AR-15, love them. “It’s an icon,” he said. “It’s a symbol of freedom. To me, it is America’s rifle.” Critics say the firearm’s branding positioned it for notoriety. Josh Koskoff — a lawyer who represents parents of victims of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in a lawsuit against the gun manufacturer Remington — cited a concerted effort by the gun industry after the assault weapons ban to use the AR-15 to shape popular opinion around semiautomatic weapons — rebranding them as “modern sporting rifles.” “When they market it to young men, there’s no ‘sporting rifle’ angle to it,” Mr. Koskoff said. “It’s all military. It’s all violent. And it’s all incendiary marketing.” Indeed, the AR-15 is also inextricably linked to tragedy. Mass shootings are central to the gun’s narrative, and its popularity. Police departments stocked up on them after a string of massacres in the 1990s. Some supporters attribute their fondness to fear of being outgunned should they encounter an aggressor. Hobbyists, like Mr. Swarey, 23, have swarmed to gun shops after mass shootings, fearful that they could be a catalyst for the government to outlaw them again. “It was right around the time of the first school shooting that made the news and scared everybody,” Mr. Swarey said of buying his first AR-15 about five years ago, when, he said, the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting was fueling talk of another assault weapons ban. “It was one of those things, that I wanted to get one before they were impossible to get.” Compared with pistols, assault rifles are used rarely in shootings. According to F.B.I. statistics, 374 people were murdered with any kind of rifle in 2016; 7,105 were killed by a handgun.  But the AR-15 has been a recurring character in some of America’s most infamous violent crimes. Adam Lanza used his to kill 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook. Stephen Paddock used an enhanced AR-style gun to kill 58 concertgoers and wound hundreds on the Las Vegas Strip in October. A month later, Devin Kelley murdered 26 congregants with a Ruger AR-15 variant at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex. And the rampage last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., renewed calls for assault-style rifles to be banned — a common refrain after mass shootings. It is unclear when and how the rifle worked its way into the United States’ lexicon of violent crimes. In 1982, George E. Banks shot to death 13 people with the weapon, and in 1997, an AR-15, among other semiautomatic military-style rifles, was used in the North Hollywood shootout, a daytime robbery in California that devolved into a nearly hourlong firefight and was televised live across the country. During the gun battle, police officers were forced to run to a local gun store and take rifles to try to contend with the robbers’ firepower and body armor. Afterward, police departments around the country started making AR-15s standard issue for officers. Mr. Koskoff, the lawyer for Sandy Hook victims, criticized the marketing of the AR-15 as hypermasculine and inflammatory, aimed at attracting young men, “ringing the bell of the lone gunman.” “What we’re seeing right now with the increasing velocity of shootings with AR-15s is a little bit of a ‘chickens coming home to roost’ scenario,” he said. “They sold so many to so many, and so indiscriminately to this younger demographic, that it’s just become a risk that increases with each sale.” An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to government data on rifle manufacturing. The data, from 2015, was not the most recently available information; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released 2016 statistics earlier this year.

Washington,206," By PETER BAKER and DAMIEN CAVEFEB. 23, 2018 WASHINGTON — One of the most powerful moments during President Trump’s meeting with survivors and relatives of the Florida school shooting this week came when a student pleaded with the president to do what Australia did after a similar tragedy. As it happened, Mr. Trump had an opportunity on Friday to get a firsthand report on Australia’s crackdown on guns when he hosted the country’s prime minister at the White House. But both men quickly discounted any comparisons, saying their nations are too different. “It’s a completely different context, historically, legally and so forth,” Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said when asked about his country’s example during a news conference. “We are very satisfied with our laws,” he added. “But we certainly don’t presume to provide policy or political advice on that matter here. You have an amendment to your Constitution that deals with gun ownership. You have a very, very different history.” Standing beside him in the East Room of the White House, Mr. Trump repeated the point. “They’re very different countries with very different sets of problems,” said the president, who has embraced a couple of modest new gun restrictions since the Florida shooting, even as he promotes the idea of arming trained teachers. “But I think we’re well on the way to solving that horrible problem that happens far too often in the United States.”  Mr. Turnbull’s visit had been in the works long before the mass shooting that left 17 dead in Parkland, Fla., and was already freighted with a complicated history between the two men for other reasons. But the timing threw a spotlight on a case study that has roiled the gun control debate here in the United States.  Australia embarked on one of the world’s most expansive efforts to rid a society of gun violence after a mass shooting in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur on April 28, 1996, left 35 dead and many other injured. At that time, it was Australia’s 13th mass shooting in less than two decades and the deadliest such incident to date in the Western world. Even in the United States since then, only two episodes have eclipsed that death toll, the massacres in an Orlando gay nightclub in 2016 and at a Las Vegas concert last year. In response to the 1996 shooting, John Howard, then Australia’s conservative prime minister, moved quickly, introducing a federal law to officially make guns a privilege, not a right. Gun owners were forced to provide a valid reason for owning a weapon, such as farming or hunting. Licensing rules were tightened, a 28-day waiting period for gun purchases was imposed and a national gun registry was established. Andrew Pollack, who lost his daughter in the Florida shooting, was a guest at a listening session at the White House. Semiautomatic rifles, like the one used at Port Arthur in 1996 and in Parkland last week, were severely restricted, and Australia engaged in a buyback program that took more than 650,000 firearms off the streets and generated attention around the world. Gun control advocates in the United States regularly point to Australia when the other side says that new laws would not make a difference. President Barack Obama cited Australia as a model after a shooting in Oregon in 2015 and Hillary Clinton, running to succeed him against Mr. Trump, said the Australian approach was “worth considering.” That was a theme picked up by Sam Zeif, 18, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, who was among the survivors of last week’s shooting to visit the White House on Wednesday. “In Australia, there was a shooting at a school in 1999,” he told Mr. Trump, getting the date slightly off and mistaking the setting, which was actually a tourist site not a school. “And you know, after that, they took a lot of ideas, they put legislation together and they stopped it. Can anyone here guess how many shootings there have been in the schools since then in Australia? Zero. We need to do something.” The National Rifle Association has long pushed back against the Australia model, citing studies that it says do not prove that the restrictions have been effective. While it is true that Australia has not seen a mass shooting comparable to Port Arthur or Parkland since 1996, the N.R.A. argues that such episodes are rare enough that it would be statistically incorrect for gun control supporters to draw a cause-and-effect conclusion.  “With such little evidence supporting their doctrines, these fanatics should spare Americans the proselytizing,” Chris W. Cox, a top N.R.A. lobbyist, wrote in November. “Even more to the point, the ongoing destruction of personal freedom in Australia stands as a stark and constant reminder of just how far gun control extremists are willing to go in their quest to disarm law-abiding citizens.” Polls show more than 90 percent support in Australia for the two-decades-old gun regime, but it has also been gradually loosening its laws in recent years and gun sales are increasing. Those who own guns own more guns — in some cases, 100 or more. Semiautomatic handgun sales, which are not as regulated as rifles, have skyrocketed. Data from GunPolicy.org, a nonpartisan clearinghouse for firearm policy data, shows that from 1988 to 2015, Australians surrendered roughly 1.1 million guns in various buybacks — and bought roughly 1 million new ones. Experts have debated the impact of Australia’s program for years. Studies have shown that the combined policies enacted after the 1996 tragedy reduced mass shootings and suicides, with the largest declines in states that turned over the most weapons. There has been only one case of at least four people shot to death in Australia since 1996, a father who killed his wife and three children before killing himself in 2014. What the United States can learn from Australia, some experts said, is that guns should be viewed not just as the cause of mass killings, but also as a public health issue that leads to death in other ways. “The gun is to gun violence as the mosquito is to malaria,” said Philip Alpers, a University of Sydney professor and founding director of GunPolicy.org. “It’s the agent of harm and it needs to be treated in the same way it would be treat in any other public health campaign.”      But, he said, Australia’s sharp shift in direction would be very hard for the United States to match. Then and now, the politics and the countries are more different than alike. Mr. Howard had just won a landslide victory when he pushed gun control through parliament and, experts noted, Australia is a much smaller country with a population that tends to put more faith in government regulation. “If the question is: ‘Would what Australia did work in the United States?’ the answer is no,” Mr. Alpers said. “What Australia did was a confiscation of private property under the threat of jail time, compensated or not. That wouldn’t wash in the United States.”  “The scale also wouldn’t wash in the United States,” he added. “Australia is estimated to have confiscated nearly a third of its firearms — and that would entail destroying 90 million firearms in the United States.” Gun control advocates said that while Australia deserves to be seen as a model, it would be a mistake to oversimplify the country’s success or assume that gun violence can be forever erased. “Australian politicians have been riding on the coattails of John Howard and letting the gains slip away,” said Samantha Lee, chair of Gun Control Australia.

Opinion,207," Supported by By David Brooks I wonder if I’m wrong on the subject of guns. I started this latest round of the debate with the presumption that supporters of moderate gun restrictions are popularly strong but legislatively weak. Since Sandy Hook in 2012, more than two dozen states have passed gun laws and almost all of those laws have LOOSENED gun restrictions. Roughly 360 gun bills have been introduced in Congress, and they have all failed but one, which also loosened gun use. The blunt fact is that Republicans control most legislatures. To get anything passed, I thought, it would be necessary to separate some Republicans from the absolutist N.R.A. position. To do that you have to depolarize the issue: show gun owners some respect, put red state figures at the head and make the gun discussion look more like the opioid discussion. The tribalists in this country have little interest in the opioid issue. As a result, a lot of pragmatic things are being done across partisan lines. The people pushing for gun restrictions have basically done the exact opposite of what I thought was wise. Instead of depolarizing the issue they have massively polarized it. The students from Parkland are being assisted by all the usual hyper-polarizing left-wing groups: Planned Parenthood, Move On and the Women’s March. The rhetoric has been extreme. Marco Rubio has been likened to a mass murderer while the N.R.A. has been called a terrorist organization. The early results would seem to completely vindicate my position. The Florida Legislature turned aside gun restrictions. New gun measures in Congress have been quickly shelved. Democrats are more likely to lose House and Senate seats in the key 2018 pro-gun states. The losing streak continues. Yet I have to admit that something bigger is going on. It could be that progressives understood something I didn’t. It could be that you can win more important victories through an aggressive cultural crusade than you can through legislation. Progressives could be on the verge of delegitimizing their foes, on guns but also much else, rendering them untouchable for anybody who wants to stay in polite society. That would produce social changes far vaster than limiting assault rifles. Two things have fundamentally changed the landscape. First, over the past two years conservatives have self-marginalized. In supporting Donald Trump they have tied themselves to a man whose racial prejudices, sexual behavior and personal morality put him beyond the pale of decent society. While becoming the movement of Dinesh D’Souza, Sean Hannity and Franklin Graham, they have essentially expelled the leaders and thinkers who have purchase in mainstream culture. Conservatism is now less a political or philosophic movement and more a separatist subculture that participates in its own ostracism. Second, progressives are getting better and more aggressive at silencing dissenting behavior. All sorts of formerly legitimate opinions have now been deemed beyond the pale on elite campuses. Speakers have been disinvited and careers destroyed. The boundaries are being redrawn across society. As Andrew Sullivan noted recently, “workplace codes today read like campus speech codes of a few years ago.” There are a number of formerly popular ideas that can now end your career: the belief that men and women have inherent psychological differences, the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman, opposition to affirmative action. What’s happening today is that certain ideas about gun rights, and maybe gun ownership itself, are being cast in the realm of the morally illegitimate and socially unacceptable. That’s the importance of the corporate efforts to end N.R.A. affiliations. It’s not about N.R.A. members saving some money when they fly. It’s that they are not morally worthy of being among the affiliated groups. The idea is to stigmatize. If progressives can cut what’s left of the conservative movement off from mainstream society, they will fundamentally alter the culture war. We think of the culture war as this stagnant thing in which both sides scream at each other. But eventually there could be a winner. Progressives have won on most social issues. They could win on nearly everything else. Continued school shootings could be just the thing that persuades the mainstream that conservatism is vulgar and socially illegitimate, somewhere between smoking and segregationism. If that kind of total victory is on offer for progressives, why should they take my advice and tone things down for the sake of a few small gun laws? The big prize here is not gun laws. It’s winning the culture war, with the gunfight as the final battle. The only thing I’d say to my progressive friends is, be careful how you win your victories. It is one thing to win by persuasion and another thing to win by elite cultural intimidation. Illiberalism breeds illiberalism. Using elite power, whether economic or cultural, to silence less educated foes usually produces a backlash. Conservatives have zero cultural power, but they have immense political power. Even today, voters trust Republicans on the gun issue more than Democrats. If you exile 40 percent of the country from respectable society they will mount a political backlash that will make Donald Trump look like Adlai Stevenson.

Metro,208," By LISA W. FODERARO and KRISTIN HUSSEYFEB. 17, 2018 In the aftermath of the rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, where 20 children and six educators were killed in 2012, state lawmakers in Connecticut set out to draft some of the toughest gun measures in the country. They largely succeeded — significantly expanding an existing ban on the sale of assault weapons, prohibiting the sale of magazines with more than 10 rounds and requiring the registration of existing assault rifles and higher-capacity magazines. The state also required background checks for all firearms sales and created a registry of weapons offenders, including those accused of illegally possessing a firearm. Now, in the wake of another wrenching shooting rampage — this one at a high school in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 — and in the absence of any federal action, gun-control advocates, Democratic politicians and others are pointing to the success of states like Connecticut in addressing the spiraling toll of gun violence. Analyses by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence show that, with few exceptions, states with the strictest gun-control measures, including California, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, have the lowest rates of gun deaths, while those with the most lax laws like Alabama, Alaska and Louisiana, have the highest. The center is named for former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, a Democratic lawmaker from Arizona who suffered a serious brain injury in 2011 during a mass shooting in which she was the intended target.  After Connecticut’s General Assembly passed the package of gun laws, and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, signed it into law, gun-related deaths started to drop. According to the chief medical examiner’s office in Connecticut, the number of deaths resulting from firearms — including homicides, suicides and accidents — fell to 164 in 2016, from 226 in 2012.  There is no doubt that there are limits to state and local gun laws. Cities like Chicago and Baltimore, with rigorous gun laws, also have two of the highest murder rates in the country. The black market for illegal guns has thrived in those cities, with gang members and criminals turning to the streets to get firearms. And the drop in fatal shootings in Connecticut has occurred in the context of a broad, long-term decline in violent crime across the country. Citing F.B.I. statistics, the Pew Research Center reports that violent crime fell 48 percent from 1993 to 2016. Gun-rights groups say the problem is not the guns, but the individuals using them. They argue that laws alone are no panacea, and that social issues like mental illness and unemployment must be addressed to help curb gun violence. Some gun advocates have also called for more training and security for those who legally and responsibly maintain guns. Still, with little appetite in Congress to take on gun control, the debate is playing out at the state level, with Connecticut seen as a model for gun-control advocates. “Connecticut’s laws are among the nation’s toughest and homicides are down,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. “Obviously the link is a circumstantial one; cause and effect can’t be proven conclusively. But the numbers are all in the right direction. States like Connecticut can help shame Congress into adopting common-sense measures that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.” State officials say Connecticut has experienced the fastest drop in violent crime of any state over the last four years. Gun-control advocates say the suspect in Florida, Nikolas Cruz, could not have bought the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle believed used in the attack, or the high-capacity magazines, in Connecticut. “We really need to do a better job at making sure we have strong gun laws in every state in the country, because we are losing our most valuable resource, which is our children,” said Jeremy I. Stein, the executive director of CT Against Gun Violence, a nonprofit advocacy group.  Even in Connecticut, where parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook met with lawmakers as they debated the legislation, the measures fell short of what gun-control advocates wanted. For example, the laws did not force residents to relinquish existing assault weapons and high-capacity magazines or limit the number of firearms people could own. At a hearing a month after the Newtown shooting, some speakers talked of the need to hold people accountable. “The problem is not gun laws. The problem is a lack of civility,” said Mark Mattioli, whose son James, 6, was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary. The Giffords Center, which keeps a state-by-state report card, gave Connecticut an A-minus for its gun laws — the same grade given to New York, which moved even more swiftly after Sandy Hook to pass stricter laws. The center ranked Connecticut 46th and New York 48th for their gun death rates, among the five lowest in the United States.      In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed a law a month after the massacre at Sandy Hook that is, in some respects, stricter than the one in Connecticut. The New York law not only bans the sale of assault weapons and imposes universal background checks, it also prohibits both the sale — and possession — of magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds. And it requires mental health professionals to alert the authorities about at-risk patients who should not be allowed to buy a firearm. As of Feb. 8, 77,447 people deemed to be dangerously mentally ill had been added to the database. Avery W. Gardiner, a president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said that generally, blue states are, not surprisingly, more likely to regulate guns and require background checks and licensing. Conservative red states either lack gun-safety laws or fail to enforce the ones they have. Her group’s strategy includes filing lawsuits to enforce existing safety laws and countering the gun lobby, which uses its muscle in statehouses as well as Congress. The lobbying has been hard on both sides. According to the nonpartisan National Institute on Money in State Politics, in the past three election cycles the National Rifle Association, the nation’s leading gun lobby, spent a total of $10.6 million to support candidates for state office in 25 states. Between 2009 and 2016, at least two-thirds of that spending went to state contests in which the group’s chosen candidate won. “Florida has gone the wrong way since Sandy Hook for sensible laws,” Ms. Gardiner said, citing a Florida law that would have restricted doctors from even asking patients about gun safety. The Brady Center sued Florida on the grounds that the law violated the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech, and a year ago a panel of federal judges ruled in the center’s favor. In Connecticut, the question of magazine capacity became emotionally charged as the stricter gun laws were being debated. That is because the Sandy Hook attacker, Adam Lanza, like other mass gunmen, used high-capacity magazines that allowed him to rapidly fire 30 rounds. A group of first graders at Sandy Hook ran past Mr. Lanza, escaping from the hail of bullets when he had to stop and reload. At a news conference in April 2013, on the day lawmakers announced an agreement on gun control, Nicole Hockley, whose son, Dylan, died at Sandy Hook, said: “We ask ourselves every day — every minute — if those magazines had held 10 rounds, forcing the shooter to reload at least six more times, would our children be alive today?”  Connecticut’s sweeping gun laws did, however, require residents who already owned high-capacity magazines and assault rifles to register them with the State Police. Today, the registry lists 52,648 assault weapons. A single resident registered 179 assault weapons, while another registered more than 500,000 magazines exceeding the 10-round limit. Between 2013 and 2017, 248 people were charged with illegally possessing an assault weapon because they either failed to register an existing weapon or had bought a weapon after the law went into effect. The state also requires that individuals admitted to psychiatric hospitals relinquish their guns, at least temporarily. The State Police is notified of such patients by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, which maintains a database, and ensures that upon discharge, the gun owner turns in the weapon or transfers it to someone eligible for a gun permit. In addition, people who were previously treated in a mental hospital cannot get a permit for up to two years afterward. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a lobby group in Newtown, Conn., declined to comment on the impact of Connecticut’s gun laws “out of respect for the families, the community and the ongoing law enforcement investigation” in Parkland, Fla. The National Rifle Association did not respond to a request to comment. Connecticut is also one of a few states with another gun law with some teeth — an “extreme risk protection order.” Akin to a restraining order for domestic violence victims, the protection order, which predates Sandy Hook, gives the police the power to temporarily take away an individual’s guns if a person makes threats, acts violently, abuses drugs or commits animal cruelty. In the Florida massacre, the authorities believe that the gunman may have made threatening comments on social media, including one last September — “I’m going to be a professional school shooter” — and had also posted a photo of a bloodied frog. A study that examined Connecticut’s risk protection order found that, from 1999 to 2013, 99 percent of warrants led to the confiscation of at least one gun. In nearly half the cases, the gun owner wound up receiving psychiatric treatment. Mike Lawlor, the criminal justice adviser to Governor Malloy, said that the law arose from two high-profile shootings in the 1990s by people with severe mental health issues. “When there’s no law that’s actually been broken, but when there is real evidence that the person is a danger to others, the police need to have an option,” he said. “Step one is to get the guns.” A version of this article appears in print on February 18, 2018, on Page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: Attack Spurs Look at One State’s Strict Gun Laws.

Washington,209," By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG, JONATHAN MARTIN and THOMAS KAPLANFEB. 25, 2018 WASHINGTON — Lawmakers will return to Washington on Monday facing intense public pressure to break their decades-long gridlock on gun control, a demand fortified by a bipartisan group of governors calling for Congress to take action to protect against mass shootings. But even as members of both parties said it might be difficult for Congress to remain on the sidelines after the school massacre this month in Parkland, Fla., lawmakers have no clear consensus on even incremental changes to gun restrictions, let alone more sweeping legislation. Over a weeklong recess, Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate remained largely silent on gun legislation, a reflection of the significant obstacles to passing even modest measures this year. Many Republicans fear primary challenges from the right in the midterm elections this fall and do not want to be pushed into difficult votes. Democrats are not eager for legislation that they deem too incremental. And with lawmakers of both parties looking to wrap up their work to focus on their campaigns for re-election, the time to pass any significant legislation is running short.  If the past is prologue, Congress will do nothing. But governors who gathered in Washington for their annual winter meeting warned of the perils of inaction. Animated by a wave of polling since the Florida massacre, Democratic governors warned that candidates would pay a political price for opposing new gun regulations, and some of their Republican counterparts conceded that the pleas of voters could no longer be ignored as they increasingly abandon the party.  “I think for Republicans our challenge in the next race is going to be about appealing to the suburban vote that hasn’t been so good for Republicans the last few races,” said Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, citing in particular suburban women. It is clear, he added, that “people want to see action.” The combination of political pressure from the governors and moves by President Trump to embrace certain limited measures opposed by the National Rifle Association could set up a congressional showdown with the powerful firearms lobby not seen since the gun debate that followed the deadly school shooting in 2012 in Newtown, Conn. The sudden focus on guns is likely to complicate an already busy agenda. Congress left Washington without coming up with a replacement for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation and expires next week. A contentious debate over gun legislation could push immigration to the back burner. While the Newtown massacre and the many that have followed have produced familiar scenes in which Democrats push for tough new gun restrictions and Republicans dig in and resist, the latest mass shooting appears to have shifted the landscape, even if just slightly, as the Parkland students have become overnight gun control advocates and media fixtures. A smattering of congressional Republicans — including some who have been staunchly opposed to gun control legislation — now suggest that they would be willing to take at least small steps toward restricting gun rights. After being jeered at a forum televised on CNN, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said last week that he would reconsider his opposition to limiting high-capacity magazines. Another Florida Republican, Representative Brian Mast, an Army veteran who lost both of his legs to a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, called for a ban on the purchase of assault weapons. Gun control advocates are looking toward the changing political climate in Florida, where the Republican governor, Rick Scott, and state lawmakers defied the N.R.A. in proposing to raise to 21 the minimum age to buy any firearm.  Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, is teaming up with Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, on legislation that would raise to 21 from 18 the age threshold for purchasing assault weapons like the AR-15 used to kill 17 people in Parkland. A poll released by CNN on Sunday, which showed support for stricter gun laws at levels not seen since the early 1990s, found that 71 percent of Americans backed barring those under 21 from buying any type of firearm. “I don’t know if crossing the Rubicon is the right historical analogy, but there is a sense that this is different,” Mr. Flake said, adding, “Where the public is and where some Republicans have been on some of these issues just doesn’t match, and I do think we’re going to have to deal with it.” Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, a longtime ally of the N.R.A., has said he would back such an age-restriction proposal. “Certainly nobody under 21 should have an AR-15,” he told reporters in Kansas last week. Mr. Flake, however, is not seeking re-election, and Mr. Roberts, 81, is unlikely to run again in 2020. At the governors’ meeting, there was agreement on the issue between Democrats and some Republicans. “We do it for alcohol; we’re talking about raising the age for tobacco to 21,” said Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah, a Republican. “I think that’s worth talking about.”      Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said that with such talk among Republicans, “this feels like a watershed moment.” “You’re seeing some significant and meaningful cracks in the bond that traditionally holds the Republican Party together,” he said. “The question is: Are those cracks enough to get something done?” Gun rights advocates said the answer was no. “This, thus far, has shown no different a dynamic than any of a dozen fights over the past two decades,” said Michael Hammond, legislative counsel for Gun Owners of America, which has fought gun control measures for decades. “People who, after a week, suggest that this is a tipping point either weren’t around during previous battles or failed to learn the lesson.”  Some Republicans, warning against a rush to enact new laws, appeared inclined to respect the wishes of the N.R.A., even as the group came under pressure from some corporate leaders, who were moving to cut ties with it. “I think there’s a temptation just to do a whole host of things that are not really addressing the fundamental problem but would make people feel better that they’ve done things,” said Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who has deep ties to the N.R.A., explaining his opposition to raising the age limit. Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky and the chairman of the Congressional Second Amendment Caucus, warned that Republicans who had run for office on a platform that included protecting gun rights would face political consequences if they changed their tune. “I suspect that a majority of Republicans are not going to turn on their base,” Mr. Massie said. While such sentiment makes it unlikely that lawmakers will consider sweeping new gun restrictions, Congress is considering a number of more modest proposals. In the House, 19 Republicans, led by Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey, sent a letter on Friday to Speaker Paul D. Ryan, calling on him to schedule a vote on a measure that would require states and federal agencies to do a better job of reporting legal and mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. But the bill, called the Fix NICS Act, which is backed by the N.R.A. and Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, is modest. It would not expand the number of gun sales subject to background checks, and it does nothing to close loopholes that allow guns to be sold over the internet, or at gun shows, without background checks on the purchasers. The bill has already passed the House, but it was included in a broader measure that would permit the carrying of concealed firearms virtually anywhere in the country. That provision is a nonstarter in the Senate, which is why Mr. Lance and his colleagues are pushing for a stand-alone vote in the House. Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York and a co-chairman of a bipartisan group of lawmakers known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, said his group planned to tackle the issue of mass shootings this week, with the hope of developing proposals that could become law.  Mr. Trump, who is a member of the N.R.A. and ran with its backing, has offered ideas of his own, spending much of last week promoting an N.R.A.-backed proposal to arm teachers. He has also embraced “comprehensive background checks” — without stating precisely what he means — as well as the proposals to raise the minimum age for buying assault weapons to 21. In addition, he has said he supports banning “bump stocks,” which convert semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons and were used last year by the gunman who mowed down concertgoers in Las Vegas. But Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican who said in an interview that he favors banning assault weapons — a major break with his party — called the proposed ban on bump stocks a “small step,” and took issue with the age limit proposal. “By raising the minimum age from 18 to 21, then you’re almost officially legalizing assault weapons,” he said. If the latest push for tighter gun restrictions has any better chance of success than the ones that came before, it is in large part a result of the fierce lobbying effort by the student advocates, including those from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the site of this month’s mass shooting. “We have a group of articulate and smart students who are also very angry and have been activated, and so they have captured the attention of our country, including members of Congress,” said Mark Kelly, a founder of Giffords, an advocacy group named for his wife, former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was grievously wounded during a 2011 mass shooting in Tucson. “Congress seems to have a hard time paying attention to important issues long enough to solve them, and they’ll move on to the next thing,” Mr. Kelly said. “I don’t think these kids are going to move on to the next thing.” Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.

Opinion,210," Supported by By Michelle Goldberg On Sunday evening, CBS’s “60 Minutes” broadcast an interview that Lesley Stahl conducted with Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump’s education secretary and one of the richest members of his very rich cabinet. It was overwhelmingly seen as a disaster for DeVos, who struggled to answer very basic questions. She couldn’t say, for example, why schools in Michigan, her home state, have largely gotten worse since the widespread introduction of the school choice policies she lobbied for. When Stahl asked whether, as secretary, she’d ever visited a failing school to find out what went wrong, DeVos said, “I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.” Like many things in Trump’s administration, this performance was shocking but not surprising. Before becoming secretary of education, DeVos had never worked as an educator or a policymaker; she was a donor to education reform efforts favored by the right, such as school choice and vouchers. Her confirmation hearings last year were an embarrassment. She appeared to be unfamiliar with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, a federal civil rights law. After taking office, she described historically black universities and colleges, founded in response to segregation, as “pioneers when it comes to school choice.” As this comment suggested, DeVos is, at best, oblivious about race. That obliviousness — or worse — is behind one of the more disturbing moments in her “60 Minutes” interview. In a sick irony, some on the right would use the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. — allegedly committed by a young man who carved swastikas into the magazines for his semiautomatic rifle — as a pretext to roll back civil rights protections for students of color. On “60 Minutes,” DeVos, whom Trump has chosen to lead his new school safety commission, appeared to signal she’s on board. To understand how, we need to start with a letter that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, sent to DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 5 about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Rubio referred to a 2014 Barack Obama-era directive, known as the Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline, intended to address the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, in which disadvantaged students are funneled into the criminal justice system for misbehaving at school. The Dear Colleague Letter said school personnel must “understand that they, rather than school resource officers and other security or law enforcement personnel, are responsible for administering routine student discipline.” Without citing any evidence, Rubio wrote that this guidance “may have contributed to systemic failures” to report the suspected Parkland gunman, Nikolas Cruz, to the police, and asked DeVos to revise it. Ann Coulter made a similar argument in a column published in Breitbart: “Cruz’s criminal acts were intentionally ignored by law enforcement on account of Broward’s much-celebrated ‘school-to-prison pipeline’ reforms.” “The logic that people try to manufacture is that the effort to end exclusionary school discipline renders schools unsafe places,” Catherine Lhamon, who served as assistant secretary for civil rights in Obama’s Department of Education, told me. “It doesn’t even bear scrutiny, really.” But in this administration it doesn’t have to. DeVos isn’t just considering ending the policy. Speaking to Stahl, she refused to even admit that race plays a role in discipline. Among experts, this isn’t really a subject for debate. “There’s some fairly good empirical evidence that says minority students are more likely than white students in similar situations to be written up and disciplined,” said Michael Hansen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies education policy. Speaking to DeVos, Stahl compared situations in which white kids are punished for classroom disruption by a trip to the principal’s office, while for black kids, “they call in the cops.” DeVos refused to say such a discrepancy is wrong: “Arguably, all of these issues or all of this issue comes down to individual kids.” Stahl pressed her on whether this “disproportion in discipline” constitutes “institutional racism.” DeVos said she was committed to “making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments.” The comparison Stahl offered was a hypothetical, but it captured the heart of the issue. Black public school students are suspended at 3.8 times the rate of white students. That discrepancy alone doesn’t necessarily demonstrate discrimination, but there’s evidence that students of color are punished differently from white students for the same infractions. Lhamon told me about one elementary school where a black girl was suspended for poking a student with a pencil. When a white girl in the same grade threw a rock that hit another child in the head and broke the teacher’s sunglasses, she was made to help the teacher clean the classroom during lunch. The DeVos interview has already sent a message that schools can be less mindful of stark disciplinary disparities. Combine this tacit license to discriminate with the Trump administration plan to encourage the arming of teachers, and you have a recipe for something combustible.

Washington,211," By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVISFEB. 22, 2018 To deter school shootings, President Trump supported the idea of giving teachers bonuses if they agree to carry guns in the classroom. WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday enthusiastically embraced a National Rifle Association position to arm highly trained teachers to fortify schools against mass shootings like the one last week. Mr. Trump, who said the armed teachers should receive extra pay as an incentive, promoted his idea as demands for stronger gun control intensified across the country. “You give them a little bit of a bonus, so practically for free, you have now made the school into a hardened target,” Mr. Trump said. The president estimated that 10 percent to 40 percent of school employees would be qualified to handle a weapon — he offered no data for the claim — and said he would devote federal money to training them. Mr. Trump has cycled through a number of proposals — including some gun limits deemed unacceptable by the N.R.A. — in the days since the rampage killed 14 students and three adults last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. On Thursday, he returned to an idea championed by the gun rights group. “I don’t want teachers to have guns, I want certain highly adept people, people that understand weaponry, guns — if they really have that aptitude,” Mr. Trump said during his second White House meeting in two days to discuss how to respond to the latest school shooting in the United States. He promoted the idea even as a sheriff’s deputy who had been the only armed guard at the high school resigned on Thursday after surveillance video showed that he never tried to enter the school to confront the shooter.  Tim Burton, a Coral Springs police officer assigned to a nearby elementary school who responded to the shooting, said in an interview on Wednesday that he had seen the deputy, Scot Peterson, in a school parking lot, “seeking cover behind a concrete column leading to a stairwell.”   We will not publish your contact information.

And you agree to our Terms of Service. Thank you for your submission. As a candidate in 2016, Mr. Trump campaigned with the support of the N.R.A. and has been an ardent advocate of gun rights.  The president spoke just after Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A. chief, delivered a fiery address to conservatives gathered for a conference on the outskirts of Washington in which he said the proper response to the carnage in Parkland was not to pass new gun laws, but to better enforce the existing background check system, and “harden our schools” with more armed guards. Mr. Trump echoed that language during his meeting at the White House, using the term “harden” more than a dozen times in less than an hour as he said a fortified school would be an unappealing target for a gun-wielding assailant. “We have to let the bad guy know that they are hardened,” Mr. Trump said. His talk harked back to a formulation Mr. LaPierre popularized after 20 children and six adults were gunned down at a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012: “The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.” The president also said he believed the powerful gun lobby would support a move to raise the age threshold for buying firearms to 21 from 18, a change the N.R.A. is resisting, along with enhanced background checks. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said Mr. Trump’s emphasis on arming teachers revealed that he was in the thrall of the gun lobby. “Not surprised the N.R.A. reeled President Trump back in,” he said. “Just amazed at how fast it happened.” Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, who has been an outspoken advocate for gun control and is among Mr. Trump’s most vocal critics, blistered the president.  “No police officer, no educator of any note is advocating that what we need is more weapons on school campuses rather than fewer,” said Mr. Emanuel, adding, “It’s totally asinine and it doesn’t even warrant a response, but it’s so reckless that the head of the United States’ idea for solving this problem is to arm more people.” The president made his comments as he convened law enforcement, state and local officials at the White House to discuss a range of proposals that could prevent school shootings. The remarks came a day after he held an emotional session in the State Dining Room with parents, students and teachers affected by the Parkland rampage as well as other school shootings. The group begged him to take action as a wave of student-led activism continued to spread in favor of changing gun laws. “There’s a tremendous feeling that we want to get something done,” Mr. Trump said in the Roosevelt Room on Thursday, adding that the N.R.A. shares the sentiment. “We’re going to take action,” he said. Mr. Trump said he had spoken with the “top people” at the N.R.A. — White House officials said he had talked with Chris Cox, the organization’s top lobbyist, over the weekend — and come away believing that “they’re ready to do things,” including tightening regulations. “They gave me tremendous support — tremendous,” Mr. Trump said of the N.R.A. “I told them, I said we’re going to have to toughen them up, because it doesn’t make anybody look good, and most importantly, I saw the devastation of these families. We can’t allow that to happen.”      But he also defended the gun lobby, saying they were “good people” and “patriots,” and adding, “I don’t think I’ll be going up against them.” Mr. LaPierre, whose remarks on Thursday were his first public comments since the Parkland shooting, criticized Democrats for calling for more gun control laws. “Their goal is to eliminate the Second Amendment and our firearms freedoms so they can eradicate all individual freedoms,” Mr. LaPierre said, speaking at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference to an audience that typically bristles at the notion of restricting those rights. The president’s apparent confidence that Congress would be able to agree on and pass gun safety legislation flew in the face of decades of experience, in which the outrage and calls to action that follow a horrific shooting have dissipated quickly amid powerful resistance from the gun lobby, and changes in the law have ultimately proved impossible.  While Mr. Trump has said in recent days that he wished to strengthen background checks for people seeking to buy guns, the White House said on Thursday that the president is not currently proposing to close a loophole for sales at gun shows. Raj Shah, the deputy White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump supported including mental health information in the federal background check system, as well as measures to ensure more complete and accurate data. The president has also been working to use executive authority to act on gun-related proposals that do not rile gun control opponents. As early as Friday, the Justice Department will ask federal prosecutors to prioritize prosecutions of people who lie on the federal background check forms required to buy guns, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the decision. The request would enforce a rarely prosecuted law that makes lying on those forms a felony. This week, Mr. Trump ordered the Justice Department to issue regulations banning so-called bump stocks, which convert semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons like those used last year in the massacre of concertgoers in Las Vegas. On Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was not in favor of one measure that schools around the nation have increasingly taken to defend themselves and their students against school shooters: holding drills to practice what to do. “Active shooter drills is a very negative thing,” Mr. Trump said after Pam Stewart, the Florida Department of Education commissioner, mentioned such preparations. “I don’t like it. I’d much rather have a hardened school.” Mr. Trump added that active shooter drills were “crazy,” and “very hard on children.” Later, the White House sought to walk back the president’s statement, arguing that he was condemning the term “active shooter” drill, not the practice itself. “He said the term ‘active shooter drills’ is particularly — could be frightening for young children,” Mr. Shah said. “He thinks a drill that has a different name and is not — the brand of it, frankly, doesn’t frighten children, might be a better way to approach it.”  Arming teachers is not a new concept. The N.R.A. campaigned for it after Sandy Hook. But Mr. Trump’s resurrection of the proposal has come under swift opposition from teachers organizations and law enforcement officials who argue it would put unreasonable burdens on educators while making schools less safe. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said she had held a telephonic town hall on Wednesday night in which she discussed the proposal with 60,000 educators. “The response was universal, even from educators who are gun owners: Teachers don’t want to be armed, we want to teach,” Ms. Weingarten said. “We don’t want to be, and would never have the expertise needed to be, sharp shooters; no amount of training can prepare an armed teacher to go up against an AR-15.” Katie Benner, Jonathan Martin, Ali Watkins and John Ismay contributed reporting.

Washington,212," By ERICA L. GREENMARCH 18, 2018 MINNEAPOLIS — When Erin Rathke, the principal at Justice Page Middle School, is called to extract a student from class, she hears the same plea over and over again, most often, she has to admit, from black children: “The teacher only sees me.” The plea weighs heavily at Justice Page, where African-American students are 338 percent more likely to be suspended than their white peers. “It’s painful sometimes, but I have to say, ‘Yes, that’s probably true,’” Ms. Rathke said. It is a reality that district leaders here have been grappling with for years: The Minneapolis school district suspends an inordinate number of black students compared with white ones, and it is struggling to figure out why. Last year, districtwide, black students were 41 percent of the overall student population, but made up 76 percent of the suspensions. Numbers like that prompted the Obama administration in 2014 to draft tough new policies to try to address racial disparities in school discipline across the country. Now, the Trump administration is trying to reverse those policies — in part, administration officials say, as a response to school shootings like the massacre last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.  The Obama-era policies — and the Trump-era reversals — have divided educators in the Twin Cities. In recent months, educators from Minneapolis, St. Paul and suburban Minnesota traveled to Washington to lobby the Education Department in support of reversing the 2014 guidelines, which encouraged school districts to review racial disparities in student discipline rates to ensure against violations of federal civil rights laws. Those that do not comply can face federal investigation or a loss of funding.  Then another group followed them to lobby for keeping the guidance. A retired Minnesota teacher set off a conservative media blitz by linking the Obama-era guidance to frustrations that teachers have with violent students, raising the issue high enough for the White House to latch on after the Parkland massacre. The coverage prompted Republicans to speculate about whether relaxed disciplinary policies had allowed the violent track record of Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged in the shooting, to evade law enforcement. Debbie York, the teacher who raised the issue in a Breitbart News article, was forced to retire after a first grader in her suburban Minnesota school pushed her, injuring her back and neck. The school district said she had violated privacy laws by speaking out about the incident. [ALSO READ: How Effective is Your School District?] The story inspired a Minnesota bill bolstering teachers’ authority to remove threatening students from their classrooms. Ms. York is advocating that the law go national, and that the Obama guidance be repealed. “It’s not about arming teachers with guns; it is about arming them with the freedom to talk about troubled kids whose behavior not only needs to be assessed, but when the behavior puts others at risk of serious harm, intervention other than therapy,” Ms. York said. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has been eyeing the guidance for reversal since she took office, will head a White House commission on school safety that has been specifically tasked with examining whether to repeal the discipline guidance. Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.     Civil rights groups and congressional Democrats are standing by the guidance and pointing to evidence that suspensions are helping to drive the achievement gap between white and minority students. Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system. In a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Education Committee, said that her office was aware of a coming report from the Government Accountability Office that would “very likely substantiate claims” of a persistent inequality in the “treatments of students of color and students with disabilities.”  “Ensuring public access to the G.A.O. findings prior to any agency action on the guidance is especially necessary given the recent factually inaccurate assertions that wrongly place blame for the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on the 2014 guidance,” Mr. Scott wrote. But in Minneapolis, as in districts across the nation, discipline policies are more than a political flash point. They are a daily struggle to balance safety and statistics, and the uncomfortable truths about how race may be clouding educators’ perception of both. “We’re in a pressure cooker,” said Michael Thomas, the district’s chief of schools. “And what’s happening in Minneapolis is a microcosm of what’s happening across America.” While critics of the Obama-era discipline changes argue that disparities cannot be explained away by racism, education leaders here say it is the natural place to start. Bernadeia Johnson, a former Minneapolis schools superintendent, launched her own review of discipline referrals for kindergarten boys after the federal government began investigating her district. The review was revealing, she said. The descriptions of white children by teachers included “gifted but can’t use his words” and “high strung,” with their actions excused because they “had a hard day.” Black children, she said, were “destructive” and “violent,” and “cannot be managed.” “When you see something like that and you’re a leader, and you’re trying to figure out how to move the school system forward — it was alarming,” Ms. Johnson said. [ALSO READ: Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys] Nationally, black students are suspended three times as often as their white peers; in Minnesota, it is eight times as often. To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state’s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation. Last month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices.  “We’re at a tipping point, and that’s what you see in the schools” said Kevin Lindsey, the state’s human rights commissioner. The school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation. “Our students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably,” Mr. Thomas said. “We’re still adjusting our listening frequency.” But some teachers say that the approach has undermined their profession and set students up for failure. One case that has received particular attention is a student’s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad. Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies. Simon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district’s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as “cultural dialect,” he said. “It threw the school into complete chaos,” he said. “The kids knew they weren’t going to go home.” Mr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word “detention,” but rather “quality time.” Eventually, he would just “sweep a lot under the rug.” The discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years — a warning, then a consequence — was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist.  “We do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students,” he said. “But not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist.” The root of those changes was in the district’s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices. Federal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher’s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days. Ms. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses. The policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move “legally and constitutionally suspect.” He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was “introducing a racial quota system for school discipline.” One month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned. “When people have kids around them that don’t look like them, they want them controlled,” she said. The district’s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies. There are bright spots. At Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a “loaded term,” said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data — there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year — showed that the school was a “healthy place” that emphasized positive reinforcement.  When it comes to misbehavior, “the conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that’s wrong with them,” he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. “If students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it’s our job to figure out why.” But, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended. Justice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course. Fresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools. The school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body. “I think we have to challenge our own biases every day,” she said. “Some teachers aren’t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we’re not going to give up on students, and I’m not going to give up on them.” There are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to rename the school for the state’s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota’s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes. “We are more than these numbers,” Ms. Rathke said. “But they’re telling us something: We have students that we just haven’t figured out how to support yet.” A version of this article appears in print on March 19, 2018, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Minneapolis Schools Look Hard at a Racial Discipline Gap.

Opinion,213," Supported by Opinion By Sam Quinones The United States is in the midst of at least two plagues with much in common. One is gun-fueled mass murder; the other is addiction to opioids — pain pills, heroin, fentanyl. Both are uniquely American afflictions, killing in alarming numbers. Both are revved in part by commercial interests and in part by the collapse of community in American culture. Both persist because of the erroneous belief that there’s an easy answer to these complicated problems. Above all, both are about supply. Laid on top of a culture of increasing social isolation for many, our vast supply of easily accessible opioids has sent overdose deaths skyrocketing. So, too, a vast supply of easily accessible guns has produced a similarly rising death toll. I wrote a book about our opioid-addiction epidemic. I first thought the book was about drug marketing — both from pharmaceutical companies and from Mexican heroin traffickers. But it was bigger than that; it was about who we were as Americans. The root of the scourge, I believe, is in isolation and a conviction that we are entitled to a life free of pain — all of which forms heroin’s natural habitat. We exalted the private, the individual, at the expense of community. We once played kick the can in the streets until late on summer evenings. Now those streets are empty as we huddle at home. More than 12 percent of the population served in the military during World War II, and nearly every American sacrificed to beat the Nazis. Today, less than 1 percent join the armed services. Kids are dosed with weeks’ worth of narcotics to keep them from the three days of pain that accompany a wisdom-tooth extraction. We’ve seen parents prosecuted for letting their kids go to the park alone. College students wilt when exposed to ideas they disagree with, and 24-hour cable news shrieks at us, forcing us into ideological bubbles. All of this has provided fertile soil for a two-decade dosing with opioids — promoted by drug companies, prescribed by doctors, demanded by many of us — that led a national explosion of addiction and death. I was a newspaper reporter for almost 30 years before writing that book. I covered seven mass murders — six involving guns. I was in Tucson after Jared Loughner shot 19 people, six of whom died, including a federal judge; among the wounded was Gabrielle Giffords, a member of the House of Representatives at the time. Over the phone, I covered the shootings at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. Long before all that, I covered perhaps the first school shooting of our era of gun massacres — in Stockton, Calif., in 1989. I was the crime reporter for The Stockton Record when a loner with an AK-47 opened fire on a playground full of children at recess at Cleveland Elementary School. Five of them died; some 30 others were wounded. My job was to find out as much about each assailant as possible. As years passed, I realized I was telling the same story over and over — a lost, isolated, unbalanced (usually white) young man with legal access to firearms. Now, Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged with the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, has taken his place among those lost boys, all products of our searing American isolation and ready supply of guns. I learned writing my book that when you unleash a vast new supply of potent legal drugs on a population as bereft of community as ours, the consequences are painful, enduring and nationwide. Enormous supply creates enormous abuse. That’s the lesson we should take from our gun scourge as well. It’s not just that each gunman procured these weapons legally, but that our supply is so immense that finding a gun — legally or not — is easy. Mass shootings plague us, but so does a decades-old torment of gun violence and suicide. Most gun owners are law abiding, just as many people have no trouble taking narcotic painkillers according to the prescribed instructions. Yet when guns, or opioids, are accessible in plentiful supply to everyone, without much monitoring of consumers’ backgrounds, and are then mixed with the isolation and disconnection in American culture today, havoc results. The end to our opioid addiction epidemic, I believe, will come from a symphony of small solutions, many of them unsexy: expanding treatment options, using jails as recovery centers, creating syringe exchanges, broadening the use of Narcan and widening the curriculums in medical schools to include pain and addiction studies. Law enforcement’s role is crucial. Recovering addicts need supply reduced. The supply of opioids on our streets is so vast and potent that when a recovering addict relapses, the result is often death. Insurance companies, meanwhile, need to reimburse for non-opioid pain treatment, as they once did. Up to now, we’ve lowered pain pill prescribing but without raising the numbers of pain strategies available for chronic-pain patients, and for which doctors are trained. Those patients thus turn to the black market for pills, but also for heroin and fentanyl, the supply of which is booming. All this, in other words, is a community approach to a plague feeding on our isolation. Mass murder calls for the same. Restoring the ban on assault rifles is essential, as is banning gun ownership among people convicted of domestic abuse, those with domestic abuse restraining orders, and the mentally ill. So is banning gun possession among those repeatedly convicted of driving while intoxicated. We need to change the law to let the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study gun violence as a public health issue. We need longer prison terms for stealing a gun or possessing one that’s stolen; possessing a stolen gun has very different potential consequences from possessing a stolen X-Box. The problem is, both the opioid epidemic and mass murder are bedeviled by our isolation. Some treatment advocates, stung by the war on drugs, won’t recognize law enforcement’s necessary role in our attack on addiction as a robust player in a multipronged approach. The Republican Party — which understands that an enormous opioid supply fuels our addiction scourge — fails, or doesn’t want, to understand that the supply of firearms is at the root of our problem of mass shootings. Moreover, the party’s response to each horror, apart from the by-now rote “thoughts and prayers,” has been the claim that this or that proposed reform wouldn’t have stopped the shooter. If one grand and easy answer wouldn’t have saved the day then we’re narcotized to inaction. To get beyond all that, we must again act as bold, resilient Americans, tackling a problem with a can-do attitude. We must stop believing in one easy answer to complicated problems, and shamefully giving up when one doesn’t magically appear. Those attitudes are just more symptoms of our culture of isolation, in which we’ve lost the habit of collaborating with our neighbors. And that, in turn, is the natural habitat not just of heroin but of that next young killer now planning to roam a school corridor.

                APRIL 5, 2018 Since the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and the March for Our Lives, the emergence of Emma González, a senior at the school, as a national face of gun control activism has drawn much attention for her role as a founder of #NeverAgain and for her views on social media strategy — and for her now famously shaven head. To many outside eyes, her hair (or lack of it) has become the symbol of her refusal to accept the status quo, her refusal to simply sit back and leave change to the establishment. So much so that The New Yorker recently published an article comparing her to Joan of Arc, as depicted in the 1928 film by Carl Theodor Dreyer: another young woman with a genius for inspiring leadership, a deeply felt belief system and “brutally close-cropped hair.” No matter that, as the essay’s author acknowledges, a few weeks before the shooting Ms. González had declared, on her school’s Instagram account, that “I decided to cut my hair because it was a pain in the neck, if you’ll forgive the pun. It was really hot all the time; it was very cumbersome and very heavy, leading to a lot of headaches. It was expensive to keep it up, and as prom time came around, I figured it would be cheaper to not have to worry about doing my hair.” Her original motivation has become shrouded in her advocacy, and in the eyes of the watching world, her head has taken on its own meaning, representative of our failure, of her renunciation. If, a few years ago, it seemed possible that with the advent of models like Ruth Bell and Kris Gottschalk, buzz cuts on women could be viewed as representations of “quirky beauty” and celebrated all over the East Village and beyond, the reaction to Ms. González’s hair has made it clear that we were deluded.  “I don’t think you can ever just shrug it off as a matter of personal expression,” said Erin K. Vearncombe, a lecturer at Princeton University who specializes in the cultural anthropology of dress. “Hair is intrinsically linked to assumptions about gender and power relations.” It has always been, from the myth of Medusa (whose hair was made of snakes, and whose glance could turn men to stone) through the travails of Hillary Clinton as first lady, when her many hairdos came to represent what her opponents saw as her slippery opportunism — and the new buzz cuts. A look from across The New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper. Sent weekly.     Hair, in the eyes of the beholders — partly because it is so much in the eyes of the beholders — is, as it ever was, a political issue. It is, as the anthropologist Grant McCracken wrote in his book “Big Hair,” “our court of deliberation, the place where we contemplate who and what we are.” And while such contemplation ebbs and flows, it is, like everything else in this heightened political climate, once again central to the conversation. At least the visual one.  Earlier this year, Rose McGowan’s shaven pate was displayed in high definition on the cover of “Brave,” her account in part of her experience with sexual harassment. Last month, Asia Kate Dillon and the shaved head returned to small screens (and promotional billboards) everywhere in “Billions,” and the first nonbinary gender character on American series television. Since the release of “Black Panther” in February, the bald heads of the Dora Milaje soldiers, led by Okoye (Danai Gurira), have become clarion calls of black female strength and beauty. And Adwoa Aboah, the Model of the Year at the British Fashion Awards in December, is known for not only her stubbled head but also her Gurls Talk platform and her advocacy on the part of young women’s mental health. In all cases, it is almost impossible to separate the image from the activism. Especially because those images exist in stark contrast to those of certain other women in the public eye, in particular the women associated with the Trump family, including the first lady, Melania Trump, and the former communications director Hope Hicks, whose long, lush locks represent what Mr. McCracken call “voluptuous hair” — hair in the Rita Hayworth-Cindy Crawford mode. It could be a coincidence, though it is also notable that some of the things the women who have shaved their heads stand for represent a group of values and cultural beliefs that the administration does not share: gun control, L.G.B.T.Q. rights. Hair is not solely a female issue, of course; men’s hair is also fraught (hello, Samson; hello, skinheads). Though as Dr. Vearncombe said, “because we focus so much attention on the head, especially on the female head, and because this attention is gendered, and because, more than anything, this attention is visible, absent hair on a woman’s head can be read as disruptive to the politics of the male gaze. Looking at a woman’s face, at her hair, has conventionally been an exercise of desire, and of an assertion of male power. Disrupting this convention, disrupting this gaze, allows us to see a different set of possibilities for the female head. The shaved head ‘speaks’ in a different way.” And what is says is multitudes. It can sometimes speak of punishment: After World War II, women in France who were accused of being collaborators had their heads shaved in public; Natalie Portman’s character in “V for Vendetta” had her head shaved during a torture scene. It can reflect discipline and toughness: See Demi Moore in “G.I. Jane” and Charlize Theron in “Mad Max: Fury Road.” It can represent instability: When Britney Spears had her breakdown in 2007, she shaved her head in an act that has practically become a synonym in the pop lexicon for unstable. And it can be a direct riposte to a certain set of social and cultural values and expectations. In an excerpt from her book published in i-D, Ms. McGowan wrote of shaving her head: “I broke up with you. The collective you, the societal you. I broke up with the Hollywood ideal, the one that I had a part in playing.” It was a way of rejecting, she wrote. “The ideal version of a woman that is sold to you by every actress in every hair commercial telling you, ‘this the secret to being beguiling, the secret to getting a man to want you.’”  This is hair as seen through the Freudian lens, wherein the whole head becomes a stand-in for sexuality. Ms. McGowan later went on to say that her hair made her feel like a blowup sex doll. And yet, by rejecting it, by shaving it, she did not escape it (none of us do); she simply transformed its messaging. As Geraldine Biddle-Perry, an Associate Lecturer at Central Saint Martins and the co-editor of “Hair: Styling, Culture and Fashion,” wrote in an email exchange, “For women who voluntarily cut/shave their hair, volition alters the symbolic grammar and so the act functions in terms of female agency and empowerment.” Which in turn raises the question of whether we are in for more head shaving, and whether that may ultimately lead to a time when, Dr. Vearncombe said, “we will not care about what a woman puts on or removes from her head.” It’s possible. Though given the history, gun control may have a better chance.

National,215," Compiled by LARA TAKENAGAFEB. 20, 2018 The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work. After the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last week, The Times heard from many teenagers in the United States who have grown up in an era of school gun violence. We wondered how this climate also affects teachers, the people we trust to protect our children. In comments on our coverage of the Florida massacre, teachers and other educators explained what it’s like to teach amid lockdown drills and fear of attacks. Here is a selection of their comments, which have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. I have been a public high school teacher for 20-plus years. Schools know who these kids are, but there is very little we can do about them. We can recommend counseling, talk to the family, dole out suspensions and even expel them if it’s bad enough. But we cannot force them to get counseling, we cannot force their families to admit to the degree of illness, and we cannot stop them from getting guns and coming to school to kill us. The only sane solution is limiting their access to weapons. — “MOMofTWOGIRLS” from New York I wince at the mention of “autism.” I’m a developmental specialist, and work with kids who have sensory issues and spectrum disorders day in and day out. Yes, brain and behavioral health are woefully underfunded and unaddressed. Yes, our entire society needs to be forced to shift to a trauma-informed perspective rather than a trauma-inducing orientation. But no, the problem here was not the youth, but his ability to purchase a gun. Our system is reactive, not proactive. — “Nnaiden” from Montana I am a professor at a community college in Florida, two hours north of Fort Lauderdale. My eyes were welling with tears during my 8 a.m. class, as I felt overcome by my feelings of grief and helplessness over Parkland. My classroom is on the ground floor, a step away from two entrances to the building, and has TWO doors. I am finding it increasingly difficult to keep my fear of being shot dead as I teach in the BACK of my mind. Many people, including legislators in Tallahassee, have suggested that arming myself (and the students on campus) is the answer. It is NOT. No matter how many weapons I have on my person, and no matter how well trained I am to use them, the shooter always has the advantage: the element of surprise. I’ll be first one shot, and I’ll be dead before I ever fire a round. God help my students: While they scramble for their guns amid shock, adrenaline and terror, the shooter is firing away with an AR and clip after clip of ammo. — Connie from Florida After Sandy Hook, when our nation’s politicians failed to advocate for and enforce stricter gun regulations, I felt despair and dread. I am a kindergarten teacher who now has to practice “shelter-in-place” drills with my young charges. Across the hall are three-year-olds whose teachers quietly sit with them in a corner of their room while listening on walkie-talkies for the “all clear.” We have a code that will be broadcast should a shooter enter our school, so we won’t scare the children. But I can tell you, while we teachers are sitting during the drill with our students, praising their quiet patience, we are thinking about where we would take them, where we could hide them should a monster with an automatic weapon enter our school. Can our five-year-olds run fast enough? How many three-year-olds can my fellow teachers carry to escape danger? Those who blame the mentally ill for these murders are neglecting the real cause of the mass casualties. A mentally ill intruder is scary. A mentally ill intruder with an automatic weapon is deadly. — Vicki Smith from Sandy, Utah I was a young teacher when Columbine happened. Years later, I graded Advanced Placement exams with a teacher who had been there that day; he was the only faculty member still there at the 10-year mark. He asked us to ask him nothing. Ten years later it was still unspeakable. My school now does A.L.I.C.E. training (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate) twice a year in addition to standard lockdown drills three times a year. We had one already scheduled for the day after the Pulse massacre, and the administration decided to keep it in place knowing it would be raw. It was. I had students break down crying. One told the class that there has not been a day since Sandy Hook that she has not paused before leaving her car and thought, “Is this the day I die in school?” We know the numerical chances, but that is not how the human heart and psyche work. Our school spaces have become so contaminated by the fear of death that no matter how statistically rare, each shooting feels as if it happens to us. On the day of Sandy Hook, I stood huddled with other teachers in our art room crying as the horror broke over us; each image more awful than the last. We all suffer each massacre. — “AhBrightWings” from Cleveland At this point, all of this sudden attention toward what SCHOOLS should be doing to keep their students safe is analogous to blaming a woman for being raped because she was wearing “revealing” clothing. I teach CHILDREN in a SCHOOL that is supposed to be inviting, safe and dedicated to producing the next generation of engaged citizens. I refuse to carry ANY weapons to my school. It goes against everything a SCHOOL stands for. The root of the epidemic of school mass shootings lies not on the school side or the victims. Do not deflect the blame onto us. Do not believe for a single moment that the security Kabuki being bantered about will help. It’s the GUNS. It’s always the GUNS. The GUNS are everywhere. Ultimately, we have decided at Sandy Hook that our right to own guns trumps my students’ rights to being alive. — Alan Foo from Philadelphia I have been a teacher for 18 years. When I started this career, it never occurred to me that one day I would have to seriously consider whether I would give my own life to protect my students. I have a child of my own who needs me. I’m not a police officer, firefighter, soldier or member of another profession for which these questions must come with the territory. — “M” from New York At my last school, teachers often talked about being nervous whenever they were in certain areas of the building that had little direct access to viable escape routes, such as remote hallways or stairwells. When we had lockdown drills, the kids would huddle on the floor in a far corner of the room, in the dark, while administrators would simulate breaching our doors to make sure they were secured properly. Every time we conducted this drill, my stomach hurt. Under such conditions, is it any wonder our educational system strains so hard to meet students’ needs? — “Greek Goddess” from Merritt Island, Fla. Nancy Wartik contributed reporting.

Washington,216," By KATIE ROGERSFEB. 15, 2018 WASHINGTON — President Trump announced on Thursday that he would visit Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 people this week in the deadliest school shooting in years, and would work with state and local leaders “to help secure our schools, and tackle the difficult issue of mental health.” The president tweeted his condolences to the families of the victims in the hours after the shooting on Wednesday, and as images of terrified students sprinting frantically away from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School dominated the news, Mr. Trump’s aides urged him to make a public statement. But he opted not to say anything more until Thursday, when he delivered a subdued seven-minute speech at the White House. “We must also work together to create a culture in our country that embraces the dignity of life,” Mr. Trump said, “that creates deep and meaningful human connections, and that turns classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors.” He made no mention of guns. Wednesday’s incident was the deadliest school shooting since a gunman killed 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012. It was the latest mass shooting to elicit a national mourning period and an outcry from Democratic lawmakers, who accused Mr. Trump and Republicans of not doing enough to curb gun violence.  Early in his presidency, Mr. Trump approved the removal of an Obama-era regulation intended to prevent people with mental disabilities from buying guns. But as he has done in the recent past, on Thursday Mr. Trump answered cries for tighter restrictions on guns by emphasizing the need for Americans to report the behavior of “mentally disturbed” people to the authorities.  “So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior,” Mr. Trump said in a tweet hours before he addressed the public. “Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!” He delivered similar remarks in November, after a gunman with a military-style rifle mowed down more than two dozen parishioners in a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex. Mr. Trump told reporters that the problem “isn’t a guns situation” and that the shooting signified “a mental health problem at the highest level.” In October, after a gunman in Las Vegas killed 58 people and wounded hundreds in the deadliest mass shooting in United States history, Mr. Trump called the assailant “a very sick man” and a “demented person.” 
                A gunman armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifle and “countless magazines” killed at least 17 people at his former high school on Wednesday.             Other members of his party echoed Mr. Trump’s sentiments. In a brief news conference, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said that “there may be some mental health issues with this shooting,” adding that it was not the time to jump to conclusions about tightening gun laws. In an address to a conference in Washington, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said law enforcement officers should look for warning signs in their communities. “You and I know we cannot arrest everybody that somebody thinks is dangerous,” Mr. Sessions said. “But I think we can and we must do better. We owe it to every one of those kids crying outside their school yesterday and all those who never made it out of that school.” As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship with the National Rifle Association. The organization provided at least $30 million in support during his campaign. Receiving a hero’s welcome at the group’s annual convention last April, Mr. Trump said he would return the favor. “Only one candidate in the general election came to speak to you, and that candidate is now the president of the United States, standing before you,” Mr. Trump said at the time. “You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you.”  But as with many issues, the president has had a complicated relationship with — and history of comments about — gun control. Mr. Trump had a concealed weapon permit in New York when Rudolph W. Giuliani was mayor. It is not clear whether he maintained it. He also has spoken favorably about gun rights over the years. However, he has made clear that he is not a game hunter, as his two older sons are. In 2000, as he considered running for president, he wrote in his book, “The America We Deserve,” that “I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.” He added, “With today’s internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record.” What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     Mr. Trump’s decision to remain focused on mental illness as president incensed several Democratic lawmakers, including Representative Joseph Crowley of New York. “The onus is not on children to #EndGunViolence,” Mr. Crowley wrote on Twitter. “When will you lead, Mr. President?” In an appearance on CNN, another Democrat, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, disputed Mr. Trump’s focus on mental health, and pointed out the high rates of gun violence in the United States compared with other countries. Mr. Blumenthal said that after the Sandy Hook shooting, Connecticut worked to reduce gun violence by passing measures to ban assault weapons and increase background checks. But “we are at the mercy of the weakest states,” Mr. Blumenthal said, “even when we have the strongest gun laws.”  Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said in an appearance on CNN that “we’ve been through this a lot, and each time we say enough is enough and then of course it isn’t enough.” Mr. Trump called for the American flag to fly at half-staff at the White House and other public buildings and grounds as a sign of respect for the shooting victims. About halfway through his short address, the president said he wanted to speak directly to America’s children. “I want you to know that you are never alone and you never will be. You have people who care about you, who love you and who will do anything at all to protect you,” Mr. Trump said. “If you need help, turn to a teacher, a family member, a local police officer or a faith leader. Answer hate with love, answer cruelty with kindness.” Mr. Trump said he would meet later this month with a group of state governors and attorneys general to make school safety a “top priority.” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said details were still being finalized for his visit to Parkland, but on Friday, he is scheduled to travel to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, which sits about 40 miles north of there. Mr. Trump originally was scheduled to visit the Orlando area on his way, but White House officials said shortly after his speech that the Orlando stop had been canceled.

Express,217," By MAYA SALAM and LIAM STACKFEB. 23, 2018 Shortly after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., President Trump said that violent video games and movies may play a role in school shootings, a claim that has been made — and rejected — many times since the increase in such attacks in the past two decades. Movies are “so violent,” Mr. Trump said at a meeting on school safety on Feb. 22, a week after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where, the authorities say, a former student, Nikolas Cruz, killed 17 people with a semiautomatic rifle. A neighbor of Mr. Cruz’s told The Miami Herald that he played video games, often violent ones, for up to 15 hours a day. “We have to look at the internet because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds and their minds are being formed,” Mr. Trump said at the gathering of lawmakers at the White House, “and we have to do something about maybe what they’re seeing and how they’re seeing it. And also video games. I’m hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts.” “And then you go the further step and that’s the movies,” he added. “You see these movies, they’re so violent, and yet a kid is able to see the movie if sex isn’t involved, but killing is involved.”  Media scholars say the claims about video games and violent movies — a common one in the wake of mass shootings — does not hold up to scrutiny.  Mr. Trump is far from the first leader to argue that violence in video games or movies can lead to violence in the real world. A similar claim was made in the 1940s, when Mayor Fiorello La Guardia of New York argued that pinball — which was illegal in the city for over 30 years — was “dominated by interests heavily tainted with criminality.” The argument that video games and other forms of violent media could be to blame for mass shootings became common after the Columbine massacre in 1999, when two students shot and killed 13 people at Columbine High School outside Denver. Bill Clinton, then the president, ordered an investigation into advertising practices used to sell violent entertainment. More recently, the position that video games may play a role in violent behavior is more often cited by conservatives. In 2007, one month after an armed student killed 32 people at Virginia Tech, Mitt Romney said that “pornography and violence” in music, movies, TV and video games were to blame for the carnage both there and at Columbine.      And in 2012, after a gunman, Adam Lanza, killed 26 people, mostly young children, at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., Wayne LaPierre, who leads the National Rifle Association, put the blame on the entertainment media. He called the video game industry a “corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows, violence against its own people” — naming games like Bulletstorm, Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat and Splatterhouse. In a 2005 essay for PBS, Henry Jenkins, a professor at the University of Southern California, said that juvenile crime in the United States was at a 30-year low even though large numbers of young people play video games.  “Researchers find that people serving time for violent crimes typically consume less media before committing their crimes than the average person in the general population,” he wrote. When it comes to video games, he said, “the overwhelming majority of kids who play do not commit antisocial acts.” According to a 2015 study by the Pew Research Center, 49 percent of American adults — including roughly equal numbers of men and women — play video games, whether on a computer, a TV, a gaming console, or a portable device like a cellphone or an iPad. In Japan, about 60 percent of the population played video games in 2016, according to NewZoo, a gaming market research company. But almost no one is killed by a gun in the country, which bans possessing, carrying, selling, or buying handguns or rifles. There were only six gun deaths in Japan in 2014, compared with over 33,000 in the United States, according to GunPolicy.org, which tracks published reports on armed violence, firearm law and gun control. In 2013, The New York Times looked at research on whether games negatively affect long-term behavior, and more recent science does not contradict these findings. A burst of new research has begun to clarify what can and cannot be said about the effects of violent gaming. Playing the games can and does stir hostile urges and mildly aggressive behavior in the short term. Moreover, youngsters who develop a gaming habit can become slightly more aggressive — as measured by clashes with peers, for instance — at least over a period of a year or two. Yet it is not at all clear whether, over longer periods, such a habit increases the likelihood that a person will commit a violent crime, like murder, rape or assault, much less a Newtown-like massacre. (Such calculated rampages are too rare to study in any rigorous way, researchers agree.) The argument that violent video games are to blame for real-world violence has been rejected by conservative titans including Justice Antonin Scalia. In 2011, the Supreme Court rejected the claim that violent video games promote real-life violence when it ruled 7 to 2 in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association that California could not ban the sale of violent video games to children. “Psychological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively,” said Justice Scalia, writing for the five justices in the majority. “Any demonstrated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media.”  See More » ",2018-02-23,0.03262633,Friday
Opinion,218," Supported by By Paul Krugman On Wednesday, after listening to the heart-rending stories of those who lost children and friends in the Parkland school shooting — while holding a cue card with empathetic-sounding phrases — Donald Trump proposed his answer: arming schoolteachers. It says something about the state of our national discourse that this wasn’t even among the vilest, stupidest reactions to the atrocity. No, those honors go to the assertions by many conservative figures that bereaved students were being manipulated by sinister forces, or even that they were paid actors. Still, Trump’s horrible idea, taken straight from the N.R.A. playbook, was deeply revealing — and the revelation goes beyond issues of gun control. What’s going on in America right now isn’t just a culture war. It is, on the part of much of today’s right, a war on the very concept of community, of a society that uses the institution we call government to offer certain basic protections to all its members. Before I get there, let me remind you of the obvious: We know very well how to limit gun violence, and arming civilians isn’t part of the answer. No other advanced nation experiences frequent massacres the way we do. Why? Because they impose background checks for prospective gun owners, limit the prevalence of guns in general and ban assault weapons that allow a killer to shoot dozens of people before he (it’s always a he) can be taken down. And yes, these regulations work. Take the case of Australia, which used to experience occasional American-style gun massacres. After a particularly horrific example in 1996, the government banned assault weapons and bought such weapons back from those who already had them. There have been no massacres since. Meanwhile, anyone who imagines that amateurs packing heat can be counted on to save everyone from a crazed killer with a semiautomatic weapon — as opposed to shooting one another or third parties in the confusion — has seen too many bad action movies. But as I said, this isn’t just about guns. To see why, consider the very case often used to illustrate how bizarrely we treat guns: how we treat car ownership and operation. It’s true that it’s much harder to get a driver’s license than it is to buy a lethal weapon, and that we impose many safety standards on our vehicles. And traffic deaths — which used to be far more common than gun deaths — have declined a lot over time. Yet traffic deaths could and should have fallen a lot more. We know this because, as my colleague David Leonhardt points out, traffic deaths have fallen much more in other advanced countries, which have used evidence-based policies like lower speed limits and tightened standards for drunken driving to improve their outcomes. Think the French are crazy drivers? Well, they used to be — but now they’re significantly safer in their cars than we are. Oh, and there’s a lot of variation in car safety among states within the U.S., just as there’s a lot of variation in gun violence. America has a “car death belt” in the Deep South and the Great Plains; it corresponds quite closely to the firearms death belt defined by age-adjusted gun death rates. It also corresponds pretty closely to the Trump vote — and also to the states that have refused to expand Medicaid, gratuitously denying health care to millions of their citizens. What I’d argue is that our lethal inaction on guns, but also on cars, reflects the same spirit that’s causing us to neglect infrastructure and privatize prisons, the spirit that wants to dismantle public education and turn Medicare into a voucher system rather than a guarantee of essential care. For whatever reason, there’s a faction in our country that sees public action for the public good, no matter how justified, as part of a conspiracy to destroy our freedom. This paranoia strikes both deep and wide. Does anyone remember George Will declaring that liberals like trains, not because they make sense for urban transport, but because they serve the “goal of diminishing Americans’ individualism in order to make them more amenable to collectivism”? And it goes along with basically infantile fantasies about individual action — the “good guy with a gun” — taking the place of such fundamentally public functions as policing. Anyway, this political faction is doing all it can to push us toward becoming a society in which individuals can’t count on the community to provide them with even the most basic guarantees of security — security from crazed gunmen, security from drunken drivers, security from exorbitant medical bills (which every other advanced country treats as a right, and does in fact manage to provide). In short, you might want to think of our madness over guns as just one aspect of the drive to turn us into what Thomas Hobbes described long ago: a society “wherein men live without other security than what their own strength and their own invention shall furnish them.” And Hobbes famously told us what life in such a society is like: “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.” Yep, that sounds like Trump’s America.

Opinion,220," Supported by By David Leonhardt On the Saturday night of their high school’s homecoming weekend in 2009, four teenagers were driving together in Coral Springs, Fla., when their Volkswagen jumped off the road and plunged into a canal. A 15-year-old in the car escaped. Three 16-year-olds — Anthony Almonte, Sean Maxey and Robert Nugent — drowned. Their families were devastated. Their high school reeled. On Monday morning, one entire class was “hysterical,” a student recalled. But outside of their community, few people noticed. Fatal car crashes aren’t big news. That same week, dozens of other crashes across the country also killed teenagers. I’m telling you about this particular crash because of the school that Anthony, Sean and Robert attended. It was Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Fla., where last month 17 people were killed in a mass shooting. Since that shooting, the survivors have done something many people thought impossible. They have changed the debate over guns. They’ve started to shake this country out of its passive acceptance of avoidable death. They have demanded that adults start protecting children from violence. No other affluent country subjects its teenagers to the risk of violence — or early death — that the United States does, and guns are one of the two big reasons. In 2016, 1,675 Americans between the ages of 13 and 19 were murdered with a gun. That made gun homicides the second leading cause of teenage death. The top cause, by a large margin, was motor vehicle crashes. They killed 2,829 teenagers. If the Stoneman Douglas shooting is finally going to stir Americans’ consciences about the unique violence of childhood here, let’s make sure that the discussion doesn’t end with guns. The goal, after all, should be saving lives. As recently as 1990, driving in America was less dangerous than in most other high-income countries. Today, we have a higher death rate than all of our peers. And teenage driving is a huge part of the problem. In some ways, guns and car crashes are similar public-health issues. With both, other countries have reduced deaths by following the evidence, and we can follow their lead. If anything, though, reducing vehicle deaths should be easier. Guns have become a defining partisan and cultural clash — Republican versus Democrat, rural versus metropolitan, old versus young. As a result, reducing gun deaths depends on either persuading one political party to abandon a core position or defeating that party. Vehicle safety is different. There is no lobbying behemoth like the N.R.A. insisting that teenagers get unrestricted licenses. The states that have adopted the safest teen-driving policies lean left, but only somewhat. Alabama, for example, passed new rules last year. Most states have gotten tougher in the last two decades, and deaths have fallen. But they haven’t fallen nearly enough, because the laws are not tough enough. Wherever you are on the political spectrum, you should be able to support a campaign to reduce teen-driving deaths. For gun-control supporters like me, it’s part of a broader public-health effort. For N.R.A. supporters, it’s a way to save lives that avoids the Second Amendment. What about teenagers who don’t like the idea of losing freedom? Many may not actually be upset. Today’s teenagers aren’t as enamored with driving as previous generations. The solution, experts say, revolves around a system called “graduated drivers licenses,” in which teenagers slowly gain privileges as they gain experience. The reality is that most 16-year-olds aren’t ready to operate a lethal 2,000-pound machine that can punish a few seconds of inattention with death, for the teen or someone else on the road. The fatal-crash rate for 16- and 17-year olds is about six times higher than the rate for people in their 30s and 40s. Teen driving kills a lot of people. The ideal system would create three license tiers: first, a permit allowing supervised driving, starting at age 16 or later (not 15, as most states allow); second, an intermediate license, which forbids nighttime driving and distractions, like phone calls or other teens in the car; and finally, after many hours of driving, the full license. Within this framework, states can still make different choices. Rural states — where driving matters more to daily life — might choose to have somewhat lower age cutoffs. New Jersey, the most densely populated state, makes people wait until age 18 for a full license. New York and Delaware, the two states with the best laws, according to Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, have sharply cut deaths in the last decade. No set of laws can eliminate driving deaths. But it’s clear that we can keep a lot more teenagers alive. The question is whether we care enough to do so. The students of Stoneman Douglas have held the country’s attention in recent weeks because of the raw moral power of their plea: Stop letting children die, and start acting like adults.

Washington,221," By ERIC LIPTON and ALEXANDER BURNSFEB. 24, 2018 WASHINGTON — Few places have seen the National Rifle Association wield its might more effectively than Florida, where it has advanced a sweeping agenda that has made it easier to carry concealed weapons, given gun owners greater leeway to shoot in self-defense and even briefly barred doctors from asking patients about their firearms. To many of its opponents, that decades-long string of victories is proof that the N.R.A. has bought its political support. But the numbers tell a more complicated story: The organization’s political action committee over the last decade has not made a single direct contribution to any current member of the Florida House or Senate, according to campaign finance records. In Florida and other states across the country, as well as on Capitol Hill, the N.R.A. derives its political influence instead from a muscular electioneering machine, fueled by tens of millions of dollars’ worth of campaign ads and voter-guide mailings, that scrutinizes candidates for their views on guns and propels members to the polls. “It’s really not the contributions,” said Cleta Mitchell, a former N.R.A. board member. “It’s the ability of the N.R.A. to tell its members: Here’s who’s good on the Second Amendment.”  Far more than any check the N.R.A. could write, it is this mobilization operation that has made the organization such a challenging adversary for Democrats and gun control advocates — one that, after the massacre at a school in Parkland, Fla., is struggling to confront an emotional student-led push for new restrictions.  The N.R.A.’s impact comes, in large part, from the simplicity of the incentives it presents to political candidates: letter grades, based on their record on the Second Amendment, that guide the N.R.A.’s involvement in elections. Lawmakers who earn an “A” rating can count on the group not to oppose them when they run for re-election or higher office. For candidates who earn lower grades, the group deploys a range of blunt-force methods against them. The N.R.A. mails the voter guides to its five million members, displaying images of favored candidates on the front, and some state chapters bombard supporters with emails about coming elections. The organization’s calculation is that its money is better spent on maintaining a motivated base of gun rights supporters than on bankrolling candidates directly. “Everyone wants a simplistic answer, which is they buy votes,” said Harry L. Wilson, a political scientist at Roanoke College and the author of “Guns, Gun Control, and Elections.” “But it is largely incorrect. The N.R.A.’s power is more complex than people think.” Compared with the towering sums of money donated to House and Senate candidates in the last cycle — $1.7 billion — the N.R.A.’s direct contributions were almost a rounding error. The N.R.A. directly donated a total of just $1.1 million to candidates for federal office in 2016, with 99 percent of that money going to Republicans, while giving a total of only $309,000 in direct contributions to state legislative candidates in 2016 and 2017, according to tallies by the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks federal donations, and the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which tracks state-level donations. Those amounts are dwarfed by the largess of other major contributors. Comcast, through its political action committee and its employees, directly donated $12.7 million in the 2016 campaign cycle to federal candidates or political parties, and the committee for Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant, and its employees directly donated nearly $3 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics tallies.  Those numbers are tied to campaign finance reports filed by individual lawmakers. The N.R.A.’s spending on messages like its voter guides does not need to be disclosed, because it falls into the category of a membership-based group communicating with its members. When candidates waver in their support for sweeping gun rights, the group does not hesitate to turn on them. After Ted Strickland, a Democrat who earned the N.R.A.’s endorsement as a candidate for governor of Ohio, backed a ban on assault weapons, the organization spent more than $1.5 million in so-called independent expenditures, like TV ads, to defeat him in a 2016 bid for the Senate. Ms. Mitchell, a Republican election lawyer who sat on the group’s board for nearly a decade, said its record of loyalty to those who stand by it was a cornerstone of its influence. “They know that it’s not easy, sometimes, to stick with the N.R.A.,” she said of the group’s leadership. “At times like this, it’s very easy to get stampeded by the media and the left.” While the N.R.A. cuts relatively few checks to individual lawmakers — a fact that has been noted by The Tampa Bay Times, among others — it does devote tens of millions of dollars to ads backing its preferred candidates or criticizing its opponents, often with vividly alarmist messages about crime and self-defense. The N.R.A., through its various legal entities, raises money for its political and lobbying efforts and other activities from two primary sources: member dues and contributions from outside supporters, including gun makers like Smith & Wesson and political groups like Freedom Partners, the Koch family-backed organization. The group has fought to keep the identity of many of its biggest contributors secret, although an audit document filed with the State of North Carolina showed that its total budget was about $420 million in 2016. The N.R.A. spent $20 million in that year’s election cycle on ads and other campaign tactics intended to persuade voters to reject Hillary Clinton and an additional $11 million to support Donald J. Trump — money that is not marked down as a direct contribution to Mr. Trump, because the N.R.A. spent the cash on its own.      At the state level, the N.R.A. also spends much more on these independent expenditures than on direct contributions to candidates. Expenditures like these are the area of real growth for the N.R.A.: At the federal and state levels, overall independent spending by the group jumped from $9.3 million in the 2009 election cycle to at least $55 million in 2016, according to an analysis by the National Institute on Money in State Politics that was published on Friday.  “Its most precious resource is perhaps the passion and political engagement of its members and its fans,” said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. This type of spending also comes with risks, particularly when the group ventures into so-called purpler parts of the country, where the two parties have similar levels of support. The N.R.A.’s presence can draw in an increasingly well-funded collection of groups that support gun control, and can sometimes unnerve moderate voters. Last fall in Virginia, where the N.R.A. is headquartered and once held commanding clout over the state government, Democrats swept all of the state’s major offices after campaigning loudly against the organization. The state’s attorney general, Mark Herring, a Democrat whom the N.R.A. had targeted for defeat, said the group had insisted on defending a platform that was “becoming more and more untenable” with voters in the political middle. “There were parts of the state where they wouldn’t run their ads because they knew it would drive voters to supporting me,” Mr. Herring said, adding of the N.R.A.’s campaign spending: “It did elevate the conversation, the issue, but it was also one that I wanted to talk about.” Still, in more rural areas where voters fiercely support gun rights, Democrats have routinely paid a price in recent years for crossing the N.R.A. In Colorado, where a Democratic-held state government passed new gun regulations after the 2012 massacre at a movie theater in Aurora, the N.R.A. helped bankroll successful recall campaigns against two Democratic lawmakers, including the powerful president of the State Senate. The former Senate leader, John P. Morse, who lost his seat in 2013 by a margin of 319 votes, said the N.R.A. had played a decisive role in motivating Second Amendment voters in a low-turnout race. After that, Mr. Morse said, Democrats have “run like scalded rats from the issue.” “They turn out people that already agree with them,” Mr. Morse said of the N.R.A. “The reason why gun policy is where it is in this country, at this point, is that the rest of us are too lackadaisical.”  The organization has focused heavily in recent years on high-profile Senate elections in conservative-leaning states that are key to the balance of power in Congress, amassing an imposing record of victories, including that of Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. But it has had major losses, too, including in the Senate special election in Alabama late last year, in which it spent money to try to defeat Doug Jones, a Democrat who challenged Roy S. Moore. Over all, the success rate of the N.R.A. ebbs and flows with political trends. With Mr. Trump on the ballot, candidates it supported directly at the federal level in 2016 won 73 percent of the time, while its preferred candidates won only 44 percent of the time in 2008, when Barack Obama was first elected president. In almost all forms of spending — direct campaign contributions, independent expenditures and lobbying — gun rights groups have far outspent gun control groups in recent decades, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. However, spending that advocates gun control has picked up in recent years, fueled by groups backed by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who was wounded in a 2011 shooting, and by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York. There have been hints in recent days, with the protests after the Parkland shooting and a string of businesses cutting ties with the N.R.A. — as well as a fiery and defensive speech delivered by its leader at a conservative conference — that the group is losing ground. Even some of its key political supporters, like Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, and top lawmakers in the state, have proposed measures like raising the age limit for gun purchases to 21. John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by Mr. Bloomberg, said he saw signs that the N.R.A.’s influence was in decline, despite a surge in 2017 in federal lobbying spending by the organization. He pointed to its inability last year to get legislation through the Republican Congress that would give legal gun owners the right to carry concealed weapons outside their home states. “What we are seeing right now is a reversal of fortune,” Mr. Feinblatt said. “The truth is, they are making bad bets. And they are out of sync. Their power is diminishing by the day.” Eric Lipton reported from Washington, and Alexander Burns from New York.

Washington,222," By NICHOLAS FANDOS and THOMAS KAPLANFEB. 15, 2018 WASHINGTON — After a gunman in Las Vegas slaughtered country-music fans with assault weapons that mimicked a machine gun, lawmakers from both parties said they would move quickly to ban so-called bump stocks. After a mass shooter massacred churchgoers in Sutherland Springs, Tex., the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, John Cornyn of Texas, was stirred to action, pledging legislation to bolster the nation’s instant background check system for would-be gun buyers. Congress has effectively done neither. That inaction sank in on Thursday, as lawmakers confronted yet another mass shooting, this time with some of the survivors imploring Congress to finally take action. Republicans called for prayers, but argued that no single fix to the nation’s gun laws would deter a shooting like the one on Wednesday in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead, many of them children. “This is one of those moments where we just need to step back and count our blessings,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said. “We need to think less about taking sides and fighting each other politically, and just pulling together.”  Democrats, who have put forward a spate of gun safety bills only to see them left unaddressed by Republicans, who control the House and Senate, seethed with frustration.  “This isn’t going to stop, members, it’s going to continue,” Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, a leading gun control advocate, told her colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “And we become culpable when we do nothing to stop it.” But the failure to act on the instant background check and bump-stock bills underscored that even on the most modest of gun measures, Congress is simply incapable of a response. What was striking in the aftermath of the carnage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School is that, now, even the victims and survivors are willing to call their leaders out. “My message to lawmakers in Congress is please, take action,” David Hogg, a student at the school, said as he looked directly into CNN’s camera on Thursday. “Any action at this point instead of just complete stagnancy and blaming the other side of the political aisle would be a step in the right direction,” he added. Melissa Falkowski, a teacher at the school, told CNN, “It’s very emotional because I feel today like our government, our country, has failed us and failed our kids and didn’t keep us safe.” 
            ""The frustration is that we did everything that we were supposed to do. ... and still, to have so many causalities. ... I feel today like our government, our country, has failed us and failed our kids and didn't keep us safe."" -FL teacher Melissa Falkowski https://t.co/92t6s5RdPg pic.twitter.com/rQUbu4Z2c6         After the Las Vegas shooting, which left 58 people dead last October, there appeared to be bipartisan agreement to take some kind of narrow legislative action to ban bump stocks, an accessory that can effectively turn a semiautomatic rifle into a machine gun. The National Rifle Association even appeared to endorse restrictions. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     As attention faded, that influential organization and Republican leaders changed course, arguing that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would be best positioned to deal with the problem through existing regulation.  Since then, Justice Department officials have publicly and privately indicated that they think they do not, in fact, have the authority to regulate the devices. With the department’s official review still underway, that has effectively suspended the proposal. Senators once again coalesced around another modest bipartisan fix in December, after discovering a lapse that allowed the gunman in Sutherland Springs to buy his weapons despite a domestic violence conviction. Their proposal incentivizes state and federal agencies to report criminal offenses and other information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The House passed the measure last December, but only after it was attached to a dramatic expansion of the right to carry concealed firearms virtually anywhere in the country — long sought by Republicans and the National Rifle Association. That concealed-carry legislation is a nonstarter in the Senate, and the background check bill has yet to see a vote. None was planned. Mr. Cornyn, one of the bill’s lead authors, took to the Senate floor on Thursday to urge its consideration. “I personally am unwilling to face another family member who’s lost a loved one as a result of one of these mass shootings that could be prevented by making sure the background check system works as Congress intended,” he said. Neither Mr. Ryan nor Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said anything on Thursday that suggested that would soon change. “Let’s be honest, I have not heard anyone explain how an improved background check system would necessarily have prevented a particular incident,” said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who helped write a bill mandating near-universal background checks after the slaughter at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. “And so to the extent to which we really don’t have a solution for these appalling massacres, I think that makes it harder to get traction for some ideas that I think are constructive ideas.”  In Parkland, where students, teachers and parents gathered again on Thursday to mourn, there was little patience for such thinking. Lyliah Skinner, a student who survived the shooting, rejected politicians’ thoughts and prayers and called for action. “If they’re not able to purchase their first drink of alcohol, then how are we allowed to buy guns at the age of 18 or 19?” she asked, adding, “Obviously whatever we have going on, it’s not working.” 
            Parkland shooting survivor Lyliah Skinner's message to lawmakers: ""They shouldn't be offering prayers and words because those mean nothing. We need action"" https://t.co/agP49UArKJ         Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, spoke of the importance of keeping guns from the dangerously mentally ill. A law enforcement official said they needed more police. Robert W. Runcie, the Broward County superintendent, took on lawmakers more directly. “Students have been reaching out to me, reaching out to staff, probably board members and others saying that now — now is the time for this country to have a real conversation on sensible gun control laws,” he said.

Business,226," Supported by By Tiffany Hsu A few swipes into the popular dating app Bumble, and the diversity of interests is obvious: Users post photos of themselves swinging from trapezes, playing French horns, posing with freshly caught fish and, occasionally, brandishing a handgun or aiming a semiautomatic rifle. But following a string of mass shootings and nationwide calls for gun control in recent weeks, Bumble is setting plans in motion to ban images of firearms for its nearly 30 million users. The company joins a long list of businesses that have cut ties with the National Rifle Association or sought to clarify their relationship with the industry since a deadly shooting in Florida last month. Some 5,000 moderators around the world will scour new and existing profiles and remove gun-related content, said Whitney Wolfe Herd, Bumble’s founder and chief executive. Bumble will not censor images that appear in users’ Instagram feeds, which can be integrated into Bumble profiles. The new policy, which resembles how Bumble already handles nudity, fake photos, hate speech and other transgressions, will extend to dangerous weapons like knives as well as firearms, she said. Users with military or law enforcement backgrounds will be allowed to post photos of themselves carrying firearms while in uniform. “We just want to create a community where people feel at ease, where they do not feel threatened, and we just don’t see guns fitting into that equation,” Ms. Herd said. Ms. Herd started Bumble in 2014 to create a “kinder, more accountable” online space where women initiate conversations. The app’s user base has expanded to include a wide range of users, including gun control advocates as well as people who use firearms for recreation and hunting. Ms. Herd acknowledged that most gun owners consider themselves to be hobbyists and do not endorse violence. She said that users — such as competitive sport shooters — could appeal to have their photos restored. “This is not super black and white,” she said. “It’s a very tricky battle we’ve chosen to taken on, but I’d rather pursue this than just ignore it.” Bumble has received complaints about gun photos, but Ms. Herd said the new policy was not an attempt to “sweep up a mess” involving unhappy Bumble users. The company, which is based in Austin, Tex., and also operates a networking service for professionals and a friend-matching function, is donating $100,000 toward a nationwide protest against gun violence planned for later this month. “Compared to what’s going on with Facebook and Twitter, we take a very proactive approach,” she said. “If I could police every other social platform in the world, I would.” Bumble’s policy is likely to meet with “significant backlash” from certain users and could even spawn niche dating apps for firearms aficionados, said Sarah Roberts, an assistant professor of information studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. (Some matchmaking services for gun advocates already exist.) “It’s an interesting demonstration of the ways in which apps and social media platforms both reflect and are sensitive to cultural change and serve as a cultural barometer but can also codify what is acceptable behavior,” she said. “They have immense power to make changes like that, seemingly overnight, typically behind closed doors.” Ms. Herd plans to eventually filter out mentions of guns in written content as well. “This is not a politically driven decision, nor a decision driven by hatred of people’s personal beliefs or choices,” she said. “Not everyone’s going to love us for it, but it’s the right thing to do.” Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.

National,228," By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and JESS BIDGOODFEB. 26, 2018 It is not just in Florida where the mass shooting at a high school is prompting lawmakers to take up gun control legislation. The same thing is happening across the country, from Washington to Vermont. What was one of the deadliest school shootings in modern American history prompted Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island to sign an executive order on Monday to establish a policy to take guns away from people who pose a danger to themselves or others. “If the federal government won’t act, states need to do more to prevent the gun violence that has become far too common,” Ms. Raimondo, a Democrat, said in signing the measure. Many of these measures to address gun violence come as students around the nation, accustomed to inaction in Congress, have begun protesting. The most vocal have been the survivors of the shooting, which left 17 dead in Florida on Feb. 14.  Still, not all states are moving to toughen gun laws. Some states are considering action to loosen regulations. Here is a roundup of what states are considering doing or have already done.  Governor Raimondo’s move by executive order was the first of its kind. Five other states — Connecticut, California, Washington, Oregon and Indiana — have passed similar “extreme risk” laws, sometimes known as “red flag” laws, having done so either in the legislature or by voter referendum. Since the Florida shooting, a dozen others are considering similar measures. Rhode Island has also joined with Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York in a coalition to combat gun violence. The group plans to create a multistate database to trace and intercept guns used in crimes or transported across state lines. Lawmakers have proposed a  package of gun measures that defy the powerful National Rifle Association, but fall well short of the more restrictive measures, like an assault weapons ban, favored by the shooting’s survivors. Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, proposed raising the minimum age to buy assault rifles to 21 and called for a raft of measures he said could keep mentally ill or violent people from purchasing weapons and keep schools safer. Republicans in the House and Senate, who appear supportive of Mr. Scott’s proposals, also called for a three-day waiting period on the purchase of those weapons, which already exists for those who wish to buy handguns. Mr. Scott proposed $450 million in new funding for school security and $50 million in mental health funding and called for a law enforcement officer to be posted in every public school. Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, has done an about-face in his rural state, where hunting is a major pastime and which has some of the most lax gun laws in the country. Even after the shooting, he told the Vermont publication Seven Days that he saw no need for changing laws. “I believe our gun laws are balanced,” said Mr. Scott, who has a 93 percent rating from the N.R.A. But shortly after, a student at a Vermont high school was accused of planning a  mass shooting. Mr. Scott said he was “jolted” by the prospect of such a disaster so close to home.  “The reality of how close we came to a devastating tragedy underscores the threat of violence that faces the entire country,” he said. “As a result, I’ve been asking myself, ‘Are we doing everything we can to protect our kids?’” Now, he said, “Everything should be on the table at this point.” The State Senate is expected to pass two measures this week to tighten gun controls. The Senate Judiciary Committee last week unanimously passed one bill — to allow law enforcement to remove guns from people considered at extreme risk of harming themselves or others. The committee was divided on the second, more controversial bill — an expansion of background checks — but in an unusual step, appeared ready to allow it to move to the Senate floor without a committee vote. The State House is likely to take up the two measures later next month. The day after the shooting, Oregon’s House passed a bill making it illegal for people convicted of domestic violence or those with restraining orders against them to possess weapons, even if they are not married to, do not live with, or do not have children with their victims. One of the three Republicans who joined Democrats in voting for the bill said pressure from groups like the N.R.A. made him want to “crawl under my desk in the fetal position,” according to The Oregonian. The State Senate passed the bill late last week; Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, is expected to sign it. “It took the voices and outrage of youth devastated by gun violence to hold decision makers’ feet to the fire,” she said in a statement. A bill filed in Washington State on Friday would raise the minimum age to purchase a semiautomatic rifle or shotgun with “tactical features” to 21, which the bill’s sponsors said would align rules to buy those guns with existing rules for handguns. It would also make the sale of those weapons subject to state and federal background checks. The bill would also create a program to allow students to report threats or potentially violent activity anonymously to the attorney general’s office and would require the state to give grants to school districts for emergency response systems.  Lawmakers in Washington are also working on a ban on bump stocks, which accelerate the rate of fire on semiautomatic firearms. The legislation passed the Senate in January and the House on Friday, with a final Senate vote remaining. Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, has appointed a committee to propose concrete actions and urged it to make its recommendations quickly. Meanwhile, several bills, some restricting access to guns and some expanding it, are pending in the Statehouse. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     Michael J. Madigan, the House speaker, said he would schedule votes this week on two gun-related bills that were filed before the shooting. One would require gun dealers to be licensed, much like car dealerships or beauty salons. The other, similar to the “extreme risk” laws in other states, allows a judge to bar a person from possessing weapons if family members or law enforcement officers ask the court to do so. Mr. Madigan said lawmakers this week would also introduce legislation to raise the minimum age to purchase military-style assault rifles to 21. Some bills loosening gun restrictions have advanced in the state since the Florida shooting, according to The Indianapolis Star. A Senate committee last week advanced a bill that would do away with a $125 fee for a lifetime license to carry a handgun, and would increase from four years to five years a permit that exempts holders from background checks when purchasing a handgun. In the House, a committee passed a bill last week allowing people to carry weapons at churches that share property with schools, as long as they are working for or attending the church, and the church does not prohibit weapons. This month, before the shooting, the measure was passed by the full Senate. The state is considering legislation to lower the age at which people can carry hidden, loaded guns in public to 18 from 21, while also requiring anyone under 21 to get a permit, including for carrying their weapons on college campuses. The State House passed the measure earlier this month. It is now before the State Senate. The House has passed a measure that the N.R.A. calls “self-defense” legislation. It would let people carry guns on the grounds of schools or churches. The Senate is considering a bill to repeal the permitting process to allow law-abiding citizens to carry a weapon without having to get a concealed-carry permit.  After the shooting, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, sent a letter to Mike Morath, the Texas Education Agency commissioner, ordering safety information to be distributed to all schools, and asking him to take steps to ensure that all schools have completed safety audits and that all have a multihazard emergency plan in place.

Metro,229," By JESSE McKINLEYFEB. 28, 2018 ALBANY  — It was, especially in a restrictive state like New York, a seemingly modest set of gun-control proposals. Prospective gun buyers would undergo longer background checks; an institute would be formed to study gun violence; courts would be allowed to seize or prohibit the sale of guns to potentially violent individuals; and a ban would be enacted on the possession of bump stocks, which can make a semiautomatic rifle shoot nearly as fast as a fully automatic version. And yet, the legislative proposals have not been embraced by the Republican-controlled State Senate. On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers tried a different parliamentary gambit: They attached the gun-control proposals to an existing bill, a move known as a hostile amendment, trying to force the Republican leadership to formally vote them down in an election year. Across the nation, the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida has seemingly pushed the needle on gun control; even President Trump, a guns-rights advocate, now says he wants to ban bump stocks and favors tighter background checks.  But in New York, the needle was unmoved. Each Republican senator, along with a single rogue Democrat, refused to take it up on Wednesday.  “They have apparently followed the lead of their allies in Washington who are unable to do anything when it comes to sensible gun control,” said Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who leads a group of nearly two dozen Democrats in Albany’s upper chamber. “I was hoping that New York, would be, at least, an example.” The vote was by no means assured, given the dynamics of the Senate, where the Republicans hold control through their collaboration with nine renegade Democratic senators, eight of whom comprise the Independent Democratic Conference. The Democratic maneuver began with Ms. Stewart-Cousins’s deputy, Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, trying to get the amendments considered and calling for the Senate to act. “We have to cross a line in our thinking, not only in this state but in the country,” Mr. Gianaris said, adding that it was “mind-boggling to me that we could watch our children die and we’re sitting here making excuses.” Twenty-nine Democrats, including all eight members of the Independent Democratic Conference, voted to consider the amendments, falling short of the 32 needed for passage. Mr. Gianaris failed to persuade a single Republican to consider the measure; more important, he also failed to lure Simcha Felder, a Brooklyn Democrat, to his side. Mr. Felder said that he felt the bills were being rushed to the floor in piecemeal fashion. “I do believe that its better to do something that’s as important as this in a very comprehensive way,” said Mr. Felder, who has sponsored a bill to put armed guards at schools, something he says he wished would have been taken up sooner. “I think ‘now’ is a very broad term,” he continued, adding, “There’s a balance between doing something expeditiously or doing something immediately that’s not really conclusive, not comprehensive.”  The Independent Democratic Conference and Ms. Stewart-Cousins’ group of mainstream Democrats have tentatively pledged to form a new majority in April, after two special elections to fill seats vacated by Democrats. (That plan still depends on Mr. Felder, who has repeatedly said he is loyal to no party.) “Those who stand on the wrong side of history on this issue will be judged harshly,” Mr. Gianaris said. “Starting with this election.”      Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, questioned Mr. Gianaris’s foresight. “Every two years Senator Gianaris predicts our demise and he’s been wrong every single time,” he said. “We’re going to win in November because we’re actually delivering on the issues that middle-class families care about: affordability, opportunity, and yes, security.” Just before the push for a vote, the Republican leader of the Senate, John J. Flanagan of Long Island, issued a statement, suggesting a variety of measures aimed at increasing school safety, including more funding for security cameras, armed guards at schools, panic buttons, “hardening of school doors,” and “a much stronger response to the mental health issues at the heart of much of this violence.” “Every responsible option is on the table, and wherever we think we can make a difference, we will act,” Mr. Flanagan said, saying the Senate could consider new legislation by next week. “Schools must be safe havens, where students can learn and teachers can teach. In New York, they will be,” he said. Mr. Flanagan’s statement did not mention the word “guns.” Mr. Cuomo, who pushed through a broad package of gun control measures known as the SAFE Act in 2013 after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., offered measured support for the Senate Democrats’ attempt. The 2013 law banned the sale of assault rifles and required registration of such rifles already owned at the time of its passage. “While we need to review the specific legislation, these are all concepts we support as ways to strengthen the strongest gun safety laws in the nation,” said Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor. The governor, a second-term Democrat seeking re-election in the fall, had been more forceful earlier Wednesday on a conference call with reporters, criticizing Republicans in Washington and other states for their “incremental” approach to gun control, including raising the age for buying some weapons, calling it “reprehensible political pandering.”  But he also conceded that “a state law cannot solve this problem,” and called on his fellow Democrats in Washington to “put a real gun bill on the table,” including new background checks, a mental health database, and a ban on military-style assault weapons, like the one used at Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Mr. Cuomo also openly mocked ideas like arming teachers or placing more security officers at schools. “That worked phenomenally well in Florida, right?” said Mr. Cuomo, apparently referencing a Broward County sheriff’s deputy who did not enter the high school after the shooting started, and saying he was bewildered by the idea of “shootouts in classrooms.” “It’s an N.R.A. answer,” he said. “Their answer is always the same: more guns.” Ms. Stewart-Cousins seemed disheartened by the lack of action on Wednesday. “To just do nothing, to continue to do nothing, day after day, week after week, year after year, in the face of things that we really all know are terrible tragedies, that we can do something about,” Ms. Stewart-Cousins said. “It’s just really unacceptable.” A version of this article appears in print on March 1, 2018, on Page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Legislation in Florida, Big Talk in Washington, but in Albany, Lawmakers Demur.

You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. “My kids cried for three weeks, every class, every day,” said Alexandra Price, an English teacher from Western High School in Davie, Fla., who spoke to the two of us at Saturday’s march in Washington. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, she said, is “like our sister school. We play them in sports.” Price wants to see the minimum age to buy a gun raised to 21, and she also wants to see bump stocks banned. Michaela Kirvan, a senior who helped organize a walkout at her all-girls Catholic high school in Washington, said that she sees gun control as a pro-life issue. “Saying that you’re pro-life means protecting life through all of its forms and all of its stages,” she said. “It’s a living, breathing human being that’s being targeted.” Sharon Burns is a former Army combat medic from North Carolina whose 22-year-old son committed suicide in 2009 with a gun she owned. She understands that the Second Amendment is enshrined in the Constitution but, as she points out, it includes the word, regulated. “Everybody needs to go through a background check.” Mark Soukup, a 61-year-old former member of the National Rifle Association from Gap Mills, W. Va., uses a gun to hunt. “Guns do have a place, but they’re efficient killing machines,” Soukup told us. “I shouldn’t be able to use my guns until I’ve passed some kind of test that proves I’m a responsible gun owner. I’m plenty willing to do that. Whatever it takes, really, to save people’s lives.” Katie Graham is a high school senior from Columbus, Ohio, whose 17-year-old friend was shot and killed last year. “I’ve never been to any kind of rally or march before,” Graham said. “If we want change, we have to make it happen. And this is us making it happen.” Keyona Smith, a junior at Fayetteville State University in North Carolina, who wore a Black Lives Matter button to the march, said simply: “I just want a solution. Whatever it takes to get a solution.” If you haven’t read this op-ed in The Times by Steve Israel, a former member of Congress, please do. He makes a crucial point: The solution that the marchers want almost certainly depends on winning elections. The college-graduation gap. “Even as the college-attendance gap between rich and poor has shrunk, the gap in the number of rich and poor college graduates has grown. That shouldn’t be happening.” There’s more — including a chart that may tell the story better than any words can — here. This column is based on a new study, which unlike some others focuses on wealth (an individual’s assets minus debts) rather than income. It’s important to look at both, but a lot of social-science research ends up focusing on income, because it’s often easier to study. You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook.

Opinion,231," Supported by Opinion By Gregory Gibson GLOUCESTER, Mass. — My sister Wendy died by suicide with a gun and my son, Galen, was killed in a school shooting. Lately, I’ve been working with fellow survivors to pass sensible gun laws, volunteering for Michael Bloomberg’s Everytown for Gun Safety. We survivors have had children, spouses and relatives shot and killed by strangers, partners, or by their own hand. Some of us have been shot as well. Holes in bodies presenting as mounds and stripes of scar tissue. Holes in hearts. Scar tissue all over. We are a diverse group, from the suburbs and the city. Many of us belong to other survivor groups. There are quite a few in the Boston area to chose from. The only criterion for membership is, well, you know. We joke that it is a club no one wants to join, but it gains a million members a year — 35,000 gun deaths, 100,000 wounds, the hundreds of thousands of family members, friends, neighbors and loved ones whose lives have been turned upside down by a gun. On Thursday, we went to the State House in Boston. Demonstrations of one kind or another are frequent, but this one was about a gun bill. Images of the school shooting on Wednesday in Florida, in which 17 people were killed, still burned in everyone’s mind, and the local media were out in force. We were there with other advocacy groups to support legislation that would temporarily restrict access to guns by people who pose a danger to themselves or others. We believe such a law will save lives, and our intent was to rev up the noise machine — to make sure that lawmakers know about the bill and its importance. The hall was swarming with brightly lettered shirts and buttons, even a few handmade posters. The reporters saw our “survivor” T-shirts and asked if we’d mind saying a few words. We were happy to do so. That’s why we were there. But the words we truly want to say about the obscenity of gun violence, and the cowardice and cynicism of politicians, and the misplaced pity of the American public, their self-absorbed refusal to put their clickers down, get off their couches and — it all turns into a rant so quickly. Or tears. We need discipline to stay on message. Reporters asked me that day — they keep asking me — about how it feels. How does it feel, after all I’ve been through, to be standing there the day after all those people were killed in Florida? The blinding camera light goes on, and I’m back in the interrogation chair. How it feels is that I’d like to plant a Boston cream pie in your face for asking such an inane question. How does it feel? Why would anyone need to know that? It feels awful, of course. Not because I “know what they’re going through.” How could anyone truly know what other people are going through when they hear their teenager is dead? It feels terrible, is one answer. Because I understand from my own experience that when you suffer a loss like this, it feels like this: Not only has my loved one died, I have died as well. My former life, the life I would have lived with that now-dead loved one, exists no more. All the years we’ll spend grieving for our loved ones, we’ll also be grieving for our own lives — our old lives. Because we don’t know we’re grieving for ourselves as well as our loved ones, we can’t get to the source of our grief, and it comes to seem bottomless, as if the world were made of grief. But somehow we survive. It’s amazing how many of us survive. It’s amazing that survival is the rule rather than the exception. I told the reporter: “It feels like it did the last time, and the hundreds of times before that. My son was killed 25 years ago. It doesn’t seem possible that this could keep happening.” “How could this keep happening?” the reporter asked. “It’s too easy to get guns,” I said. “It’s too easy for disturbed juveniles with still-developing brains to get guns. It’s too easy for mentally ill people to get guns.” We were already too deep in the weeds. The camera light snapped off; the reporters moved on. But the interview continues in my imagination. I have questions for the reporter. Do you think that what you are doing will stop what’s happening with guns in this country? Why are you so curious about my squishy emotional insides when they are clearly not part of the situation you are supposedly reporting? Surely you’re aware of the iconography of televised mass shooting reports. The fleeing victims, the hugging weepers, the shrouded corpses, the departing ambulance. There’s a form to it now. It’s drama. It’s entertainment. How does it feel to keep reporting mass shootings as you do? When gun violence becomes commodified as content by the media, we consume it rather than experience it. As a nation, we’re dead to it now. Despite our momentary hysteria, we’ve pretty much compartmentalized gun death, random mass shootings in particular. Consequently, we live in a country that seems to agree that 33,000 gun deaths a year is an acceptable price to pay for our unique, constitutionally guaranteed access to firearms. I do not believe this can be true. But how do I pierce America’s complacent hide? Polls tell us that than 90 percent of people favor universal background checks, but a much smaller percentage actually do anything — at the ballot box or anywhere else — to make background checks a reality. How do we break through to the goodness in people? How do we get the attention of that vast middle? There we were, pushing for another law that will save a few families from enduring what our families have endured. There are models that work; Massachusetts has some of the most stringent gun laws in the country. It also has the lowest gun death rate in America. There are dozens of ways to reduce gun violence, but the country as a whole seems to lack the will to do any of them. We lack the will to elect people who understand that sensible gun laws will save lives. I’ve been at this for 25 years, and frankly I’m fed up with carefully reasoned essays, with weeping in front of cameras. I’m fed up with vigils, candles and moments of silence, and I think America is, too. Perhaps my next sound bite should be a snarl. I know of a survivor who has a crime-scene photograph of her daughter’s bullet-riddled corpse. When she speaks with politicians about gun laws, she shows them the photograph. I have a similar photograph of my son. Perhaps the time has come to use it. Desensitized by repeated trauma? You bet! In 1955, after the white men who tortured and killed 14-year-old Emmett Till were acquitted, the novelist Chester Himes said, “The real horror comes when your dead brain must face the fact that we as a nation don’t want it to stop.” If we wanted it to stop, Himes said, we’d do something about it.

Opinion,232," Supported by Letters To the Editor: Re “Horror at Florida School; Ex-Student Held” (front page, Feb. 15): Enough. All citizens of good conscience should call their representatives and senators — local, state and national — and demand legislation banning assault rifles and ammunition. If that doesn’t work, in November vote for those who will end the control of the gun and ammunition manufacturers over the National Rifle Association and the control of both over our legislators. We need gun reform and campaign finance reform. We no longer need “a well regulated militia” or a citizen army. We have a very powerful military to protect us. Along with federal, local and state law enforcement, we are well beyond the need for militias. We have power as citizens. We have the vote. If we don’t use this power, we have nobody to blame for the senseless violence other than ourselves. JOANNE POLVY COHENSHERMAN OAKS, CALIF. To the Editor: With several school shootings already in 2018, when will supporters of free access to assault weapons recognize their choice? They can protect their children or protect their guns. It is long past time to end this uniquely American tragedy. ROBERT SOMMERNEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. To the Editor: The saddest fact in all of this is that nothing will change. After all of the investigations into motives, investigations of the personality of the killer, looking at his postings on social media, talking to his friends and relatives, the one thing that will be ignored is that weapons designed exclusively for warfare, weapons whose specific purpose is to inflict as much damage to humans in as short a time as possible, are so readily available to the public. As long as our elected representatives blindly do the bidding of the National Rifle Association, such shootings will continue. It should be apparent that the real government of the United States isn’t Congress, the presidency or the judiciary. It is the N.R.A., and changing that is a challenge no one wants to take on, regardless of how many Americans are slaughtered. JAROSLAV HAVELWEST CALDWELL, N.J. To the Editor: We are steadily conditioning schoolchildren to be afraid that they will be murdered at school. How can children pay attention to learning when their minds are preoccupied by the fear of school attacks? What might we say about a society that values gun availability ahead of children’s well-being? STANLEY FROUD, NEW YORK To the Editor: I’m tired, outraged and angry. The only way to fight fire with fire is to band together and establish a National Gun Safety Association as a counterweight to the National Rifle Association. Plenty of people like me support the Second Amendment, but millions of us also recognize the difference between a musket and an AK-47 or an AR-15, used by the Florida gunman. I promise to become the first card-carrying member of the National Gun Safety Association and will proudly display my bumper sticker. BETH HARRISONST. PETERSBURG, FLA. To the Editor: How about legislation requiring the buyers of semiautomatic rifles to obtain liability insurance? The insurance companies would profit from issuing the policies, but for their own financial protection, would carefully vet the applicants, declining to insure those who are inappropriate owners of such weapons, like the Florida shooter. How about limiting sales of bullets so that an individual cannot possess multiple magazines at one time? How about putting our heads together and solving this? LARRY NESSENSONBERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. To the Editor: While millions express horror about gun violence in this country, gun owners remain silent. Because if you do stand up and speak against gun violence, you might be seen as “one of them” — anti-gun folks who just don’t get the Second Amendment. You, responsible gun owners, are the only voice left that can make a difference, the only ones who can put a stop to the madness. But you need to be outraged and not afraid to show it. You need to speak out, and you need to admit reality. You need to know that in doing so, you will not be less of a person, but more because admitting your outrage against children being shot in school shows that you are more. You will not appear weaker, but stronger, because standing up for what is right takes strength and courage, especially for gun owners like you who fear that speaking up will somehow diminish you in the eyes of other gun owners. It won’t. NANCY O’HALLORANCUMBERLAND, R.I. To the Editor: If Sandy Hook did not change the minds of Republicans about an automatic weapon ban, the Florida shooting will certainly have no effect. Our only hope is for the Democratic Party to put forth a presidential candidate who fearlessly and relentlessly champions an assault weapon ban. The Democrats had better get it right this time. They have a lot to make up for. CARA SCHIRRMEISTER, NEW YORK To the Editor: Time to do something serious about guns. Time to get some momentum on the scourge of gun deaths. Suggestion: What if celebrities and other public figures publicly turned in their guns? Imagine the impact. The moral courage could start a movement. It’s time. OWEN CYLKEFORT LAUDERDALE, FLA. To the Editor: You can keep your thoughts and prayers. Those of us who want to be safe at school, church, the movie theater, nightclubs and elsewhere in public apparently don’t matter to lawmakers who continue to take the National Rifle Association’s money and vote against common-sense gun laws. We need but will not get mandatory background checks, bans on automatic weapons, and prohibitions on where guns can be carried. My home state of Georgia has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the country. Last year, Georgia lawmakers voted to allow open carry on college campuses. Mix immaturity, impulsivity and possibly alcohol or drugs. It’s only a matter of time. Who is going to pay for the carnage caused by guns: medical bills for maimed victims, therapy for families and bystanders who’ve been traumatized for life, loss of income for the injured and their families, funeral expenses, rebuilding of schools deemed too tainted to be used again? I propose that those who own automatic weapons should pay a stiff upfront tax at least the cost of the weapon as well as a yearly use tax. The money could go to fund the cost of the ever more frequent incidents of violence. SUSAN VENEZIA, JOHNS CREEK, GA. To the Editor: How many dead are required before Congress will give up the donations from the gun lobby and save the lives of innocent children, men and women? By failing to act, they are selling death. They should be ashamed. GEORGE CONTARSY, LAS VEGAS     Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS",2018-02-15,0.0199389,Thursday
Opinion,233," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Darcy Schleifstein, Zachary Dougherty and Sarah Emily Baum The killings of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida may be the massacre that finally gets federal and state governments to enact common-sense gun control laws. That should have happened after Columbine. It should have happened after Virginia Tech. It should have happened after Sandy Hook. But it didn’t. The Stoneman Douglas shooting is where our generation draws a line. Our parents and grandparents did not succeed in ensuring our safety at school. So we must do it ourselves. We are Generation Z, the generation after millennials. We outnumber them by nearly one million and may be the largest cohort of future American spenders since the baby boomers. We have more than $30 billion in spending power and wield enormous influence in family spending. Our spending power will only increase as we begin to earn our own wages. We will flex our muscles at the ballot box, too. Many high school seniors will cast their first ballots this November, and in 2020, a majority of today’s high school students will most likely be able to vote in their first presidential election. And we will not forget the elected officials who turned their backs on their duty to protect children. Let us remind politicians like Donald Trump, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell who accept donations from the National Rifle Association and oppose efforts to restrict gun purchases that we are the future leaders and voters of this country. Let us remind corporations like FedEx that provide discounts to N.R.A. members that we are their future customers. The Stoneman Douglas students who began speaking out after the killings last month have better articulated the need for common-sense gun control laws and school safety than our elders ever have. But those students cannot do it alone. We as a generation must band together behind them, just as Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson and others stood behind George Washington and fought to create this great country. We applaud many of the elected officials who have said they will work to reduce gun violence in their states. We hope Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey, our home state, will work with us and other advocates to do the same. We also support companies like Dick’s Sporting Goods, Avis Budget Group, Hertz, Delta, United and Walmart, which have stood behind the principles of the March for Our Lives movement and either cut ties with the N.R.A. or changed their policies on firearms sales. On March 24, hundreds of thousands of children and teenagers nationwide will participate in March for Our Lives. We are among the 19 students helping organize New Jersey’s march, which will take place in Newark, a city with far too much gun violence. We implore students, their parents, teachers, school administrators, religious leaders, corporate executives and elected officials across the country to join any march, no matter where they are, and fight to make our schools safe. March for Our Lives is not just one day. It represents the official start of when we all must stand with the Stoneman Douglas students and say, “Never again.” This isn’t about being aligned with one political party or another. This is about protecting this nation’s children, whether they are related to you by blood, or whether they are children you have taught or nurtured. We are the future of this country, yet we can no longer assume that we are safe from mass shootings in our schools. Nor can we assume our elders will protect us. Instead, we have to work ourselves to end senseless killing, not just for our sakes, but for the sakes of future generations of Americans. ☐ Darcy Schleifstein is a sophomore at Randolph High School, Zachary Dougherty is a junior at Toms River North High School and Sarah Emily Baum is a senior at Marlboro High School, all in New Jersey.

Opinion,235," Supported by Letters To the Editor: Re “Trump Suggests Armed Teachers Get ‘Bit of Bonus’ ” (front page, Feb. 23): President Trump urges that teachers be armed with weapons in school settings. I am outraged by the suggestion, and the cavalier, contemptuous disrespect for some of the most noble professional citizens in our society. Teachers are required to have graduate degrees in most states; they go through rigorous programs in philosophy of education, psychology and the content of a variety of academic disciplines. There is no place in the teacher education curriculum for Marksmanship 101. This suggestion shows ignorance of educators and of public education. American teachers do sacred work, are underpaid and are under frequent political attack. Envisioning teachers as an armed militia, as a corps of guards with military discipline ready to do effective battle, is not reassuring. It is a fantasy masquerading as a solution. TIBBI DUBOYS, NEW YORK The writer is professor emerita in the School of Education at Brooklyn College, CUNY. To the Editor: Let’s consider for a moment the imbecility of the suggestion that teachers be armed and ready to return fire in the event of another school shooting. If the perpetrator is a student at the school, the teachers would be firing at a child; how many teachers do you know who would actually do this? In the event of a firefight, there is the possibility of friendly-fire casualties; how many teachers would be willing to take that risk? We already ask too much of teachers: We ask them to work for little pay in underfunded, overflowing classrooms, and they do. They do because they are committed to their mission to educate, nurture and help the next generations succeed. To our president and members of Congress: Go ahead and ask that same person to take on the responsibility of potentially killing a student, friendly-fire or otherwise, and see what response you get. BROOKE JONES, HONOLULU To the Editor: I am trying to picture myself as I am teaching “a thing of beauty is a joy forever” with a gun holster on my hip. RUTH CANDEUB, EDISON, N.J. The writer is a retired English teacher. To the Editor: I recently learned that a kindergarten student told her mother that she had been instructed on how to survive an in-school shooting: Hiding under a desk and playing dead were advised. Not wanting to leave anything to chance, the mother ordered a bulletproof backpack, to be used as a shield. Is this what we are coming to? Is the possession of an assault weapon so important to some of our citizens that they are willing to risk the psychological traumatization of an entire generation?

Opinion,236," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor Last week, The Times published an essay by Michael Ian Black, “The Boys Are Not All Right,” that drew more than 2,100 comments on the Times site. Mr. Black is addressing some of those comments here; they have been edited for length and clarity. Max, Raleigh: 1) If you want to talk about aggressive masculinity having downsides, then you better mention that men continue to be the vast majority of soldiers, police officers, and firefighters — the people who die for this country, and to protect others. You can’t talk about aggressive masculinity without talking about its obvious social benefits. 2) Yes, it’s true these killers are men. There is zero evidence that their actions were a matter of expressing masculinity. Tying them to masculinity in the absence of evidence is purely ideological. 3) There is zero evidence that changing how we raise boys will have the intended effect. There is also zero evidence that changing how we raise boys will have a beneficial effect on boys. As far as I can tell, this is an excuse to continue to criticize men and masculinity without attending to the positives of men and masculinity. It will not do anything to bring our country together, or to end the tensions between the sexes. Michael Ian Black: 1. Aggression can certainly be a beneficial trait. The flip side of this in your examples are the often debilitating symptoms soldiers, police officers, and firefighters exhibit as a result of their jobs. So many of these men are reluctant to seek help for the simple reason that, for so many men, needing help is the same as being weak, anathema for men. 2. I agree with you that a shooter’s motive cannot be reduced to something as simple as “being a man,” nor did I mean to imply so. My larger point is that we need to examine why only men commit these crimes. What is going on with our boys and young men that allows them to walk into a public space and open fire, but not girls and young women? My piece is an attempt to start talking about that question. 3. My interest in writing this piece was not “bring the country together; it was an attempt to reduce gun violence and try to broaden the conversation from guns to other possible contributing factors, including the preponderance of boys committing these crimes. Bobotheclown: To have a loving father figure requires that he be secure, which requires that he has a job. In today’s world there are millions of people with no hope of ever being employed again. The real problem is that work itself is broken and the means by which men have always defined themselves is disappearing. A man without work is not a man at all, in the internal calculus of American masculinity. A man who no longer has a positive self-image cannot possibly raise a boy to have one. The problem is not just that our boys are broken but that our men are broken as well. MIB: I wholeheartedly agree about the problem of men in the culture but wanted to begin the conversation with boys and young men because I view this problem as multigenerational, and it seems to me that we need to start with the youth. We also need to decouple a man’s self-worth from his earning power, a power often out of his control. A man is more than his occupation. JediProf: We could start by refusing to gender certain behavior or personality traits. If someone is aggressive, just call it aggressive, not masculine. If someone is nurturing, just call it nurturing, not feminine. We need to abandon classifying the world according to masculine and feminine categories, which are inventions of society. MIB: Yes, the entire language around issues of masculinity (and, perhaps, femininity) needs to change. How do we do this? How does one start to build a new way to speak and think about a subject so ingrained? I don’t know. Mr. Florentino: I cried as I read this. My son — a high school and college wrestler who achieved much success on the mat — is one of the most sensitive souls I know. But far too often, I cheered his masculinity, his fierceness, and his muscles. I should have been cheering his kindness, his empathy, and his innate ability to be gentle. Those emotional qualities are what REALLY make him strong. MIB: I am very interested in a fuller expression of male strength. Physical strength is great (I wish I had more of it, because I would like, for once in my life, to look good shirtless on a beach). But a man’s strength can be expressed in innumerable ways, including the strength to be vulnerable, the strength to ask for help, to seek forgiveness, to display empathy. By all means, root for your son, but root for his entire being. It sounds like you’re doing that. Michael Ian Black (@michaelianblack) is a comedian, actor and author.

Business,237," By DANIEL VICTORFEB. 22, 2018 Dana Loesch, the spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, focused her ire on the news media in a combative and defiant speech on Thursday, in sharp contrast to the approach she took before an audience of gun violence survivors a day earlier. In a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., Ms. Loesch accused the news media of ignoring the N.R.A.’s viewpoint and cashing in on the deaths of students. “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” Ms. Loesch said. “You guys love it. I’m not saying that you love the tragedy, but I am saying that you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold.” The gun lobbying organization, which went silent on its Twitter account for six days following the shooting that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, has waded back into the national conversation over guns and school safety.  In his speech at the conference, Wayne LaPierre, the group’s president, slammed “the breakneck speed of calls for more gun control, and the breathless national media eager to smear the N.R.A.”  “As usual, the opportunists wasted not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain,” he said. The remarks came one day after Ms. Loesch and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, were heavily jeered at a CNN town hall-style meeting that was attended by many of the families affected by last week’s school shooting. There, Ms. Loesch didn’t change the substance of her arguments or make concessions, but she resisted many of her common lines of attack.      “I don’t believe that this insane monster should have ever been able to obtain a firearm, ever,” she said. “I do not think that he should have gotten his hands on any kind of weapon. That’s No. 1.” She spoke in a somewhat measured tone and praised the students for using their voices. She said that the system for background checks was “flawed” (though the N.R.A. opposes their expansion). The crowd, which overwhelmingly supported gun control, chanted “shame on you” as she left the stage. 
            What CNN didn’t show you last night was Dana Loesch from the NRA being escorted out, while chants of “shame on you” were being yelled from the crowd. #NeverAgain #BanAssaultWeapons pic.twitter.com/je3loW7bZd         On Thursday, Ms. Loesch said she had needed a security detail to leave the event. “There were people rushing the stage and screaming, ‘Burn her,’” she said. A CNN spokesman said that its security personnel accompanied all the speakers, including Ms. Loesch, from the stage, and that Ms. Loesch also had her own private security. But he did not say whether she had been threatened. The N.R.A. criticizing the media is nothing new, but some journalists chafed at the idea that they were emotionally untouched by the deaths of children. 
            The point of all of this is to say that people in the media aren’t real human beings with souls and families and feelings, which is disgusting. https://t.co/CpP9iW3NQ2          ",2018-02-22,0.017203612,Thursday
National,238," By JULIE BOSMAN and STEPHANIE SAULFEB. 22, 2018 All week long in Brady Shutt’s classroom at Liberty High School, north of Iowa City, his students have been talking about school shootings. So on Thursday, when President Trump proposed arming teachers to curb violence, Mr. Shutt posed a question to his students: What do you think of the idea of training teachers to have guns in schools? Eyes bugged out. Heads vigorously shook no. “They said, ‘You mean arming teachers? Teachers like you? Why would a teacher ever have a gun in school?’” Mr. Shutt recalled. “It just didn’t fit into their worldview. And there were concerns about what that would do to the relationship between teacher and student.” Mr. Shutt said he was deeply opposed to Mr. Trump’s proposal — in particular the idea that federal funds should be used to train teachers in how to use a gun, when educators, Mr. Shutt said, had so many other needs.  Even in gun-friendly locales like rural Indiana, teachers reacted with alarm to Mr. Trump’s plan, which came a little more than a week after a gunman killed 17 at a high school in Florida.  In Shelbyville, Ind., where deer and turkey hunting are popular, Teresa Meredith, a kindergarten teacher, said she was stunned by the notion that weapons would have a sanctioned place in an American classroom. Mr. Trump’s comments, she said, seemed to be taking for granted that mass shootings would continue. “It felt like he was giving up and saying, ‘This is the new normal,’ instead of saying, ‘How can we prevent this from happening in the first place?’” Ms. Meredith said. “As a teacher, I’m supposed to teach and love and educate and nurture.”   We will not publish your contact information.

And you agree to our Terms of Service. Thank you for your submission. Annaka Larson, 34, a first-grade teacher at Paul and Sheila Wellstone Elementary in St. Paul, Minn., said that on Wednesday, after Trump seemed to float the idea of arming teachers, the subject dominated a meeting that was supposed to be spent planning lessons. Not a single teacher in the room supported the idea, she said. A number of teachers, like Skye Warren, who teaches in Houston’s Third Ward, flooded Twitter on Thursday with opposition to Mr. Trump’s plan. 
            #CNNTownHall As a teacher, I’m letting you know I’m not carrying a gun to work. I’m not bringing guns around my children. I am not a police officer or in the army for a reason, I teach kids — I don’t go to war every day. My job is to educate children.         Ms. Warren, who is in her first year of teaching, worries that placing guns in schools would harm students. “Our kids are already exposed to so many of these violent crimes,” Ms. Warren said. “It’s unacceptable for them not to have safe space like schools. ”  Mr. Trump’s idea is not new. A similar proposal was raised in 2012, following the massacre of first graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The nation’s largest education organizations immediately rejected it. “Firearms in principals’ and teachers’ hands might do more harm than good,” the National Association of Secondary School Principals said in a December 2012 statement. “To be effective, schools must be perceived as safe havens.”      Tom Kuroski, president of the Newtown Federation of Teachers and a teacher of 33 years, said that he could not conceive how such a measure would have prevented the Sandy Hook massacre. “It just shows you how removed they are from what happens in the classroom on a day-to-day basis,” Mr. Kuroski said. He added he would be in favor of hiring retired law enforcement officials or military veterans, those trained in using a weapon, to help secure schools. Opposition also came from the leaders of large school districts. “The mere thought that teachers should be armed in order to ward off violence is utterly illogical and will only result in making our students and teachers less safe,” said Tommy Chang, the superintendent of Boston Public Schools, in a statement. “The real issue at hand continues to be access to guns.” Rocky Hanna, the head of a large Florida school district encompassing Tallahassee, said he had not talked to a single person in education or law enforcement who believed it was a good idea. “Teachers are educators, not security guards,” Mr. Hanna said. Despite opposition to the idea, dozens of schools across the country, many of them in Ohio, say they have successfully started programs in which select teachers are trained and armed. Chad Wyen, superintendent of Mad River Local Schools, located in the Dayton metro area, said his district passed a policy to establish a response team that could access weapons following a 2016 nonfatal school shooting in the nearby town of Middletown.  Mr. Wyen said that he was determined that he would not leave his 3,900-student school system, which includes his own children, vulnerable. “I decided that we may not be able to stop everything, but we can stop a lot,” Mr. Wyen said. But a survey by the National Education Association in 2013 found that only 22 percent of N.E.A. members favored a proposal to train and arm school employees. Studies have also found that many law enforcement personnel oppose the idea. Steve Dillon has spent decades teaching science and special education in Tehama County, a rural area in Northern California where a gunman entered an elementary school after killing five people last fall. Mr. Dillon, 60, has owned a shotgun for nearly 50 years and occasionally goes hunting or skeet shooting. But, he said, he would never want a teacher armed on campus. “I specifically came to teaching because I wasn’t going to need to do anything with a gun,” he said. “There’s a lot of teachers who are under a lot of stress. All it takes is one kid to get into something that they are not supposed to be into — if they find the weapon, what are the results?” Erica L. Green, Julie Turkewitz, Jennifer Medina and Jess Bidgood contributed.

This time, the students who survived are leading the charge. The aftermath of a mass shooting has become a familiar cycle in the United States: One side demands change, the other works to block it. But this time, it is the students who survived the assault who are pressing lawmakers to impose new restrictions on guns. On today’s episode: • Michael D. Shear, a White House correspondent for The New York Times. Background reading: • The father of a student killed last week at a Florida high school pressed President Trump to act, asking, “How many children have to get shot?” It was one of many dramatic exchanges on Wednesday about gun violence.  • The students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School lobbied state lawmakers to strengthen gun control, and met resistance.  • Senator Marco Rubio and a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association were repeatedly heckled during a nationally televised forum after they refused to back new gun control measures.

Opinion,240," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Michael Ian Black I used to have this one-liner: “If you want to emasculate a guy friend, when you’re at a restaurant, ask him everything that he’s going to order, and then when the waitress comes … order for him.” It’s funny because it shouldn’t be that easy to rob a man of his masculinity — but it is. Last week, 17 people, most of them teenagers, were shot dead at a Florida school. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School now joins the ranks of Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Columbine and too many other sites of American carnage. What do these shootings have in common? Guns, yes. But also, boys. Girls aren’t pulling the triggers. It’s boys. It’s almost always boys. America’s boys are broken. And it’s killing us. The brokenness of the country’s boys stands in contrast to its girls, who still face an abundance of obstacles but go into the world increasingly well equipped to take them on. The past 50 years have redefined what it means to be female in America. Girls today are told that they can do anything, be anyone. They’ve absorbed the message: They’re outperforming boys in school at every level. But it isn’t just about performance. To be a girl today is to be the beneficiary of decades of conversation about the complexities of womanhood, its many forms and expressions. Boys, though, have been left behind. No commensurate movement has emerged to help them navigate toward a full expression of their gender. It’s no longer enough to “be a man” — we no longer even know what that means. Too many boys are trapped in the same suffocating, outdated model of masculinity, where manhood is measured in strength, where there is no way to be vulnerable without being emasculated, where manliness is about having power over others. They are trapped, and they don’t even have the language to talk about how they feel about being trapped, because the language that exists to discuss the full range of human emotion is still viewed as sensitive and feminine. Men feel isolated, confused and conflicted about their natures. Many feel that the very qualities that used to define them — their strength, aggression and competitiveness — are no longer wanted or needed; many others never felt strong or aggressive or competitive to begin with. We don’t know how to be, and we’re terrified. But to even admit our terror is to be reduced, because we don’t have a model of masculinity that allows for fear or grief or tenderness or the day-to-day sadness that sometimes overtakes us all. Case in point: A few days ago, I posted a brief thread about these thoughts on Twitter, knowing I would receive hateful replies in response. I got dozens of messages impugning my manhood; the mildest of them called me a “soy boy” (a common insult among the alt-right that links soy intake to estrogen). And so the man who feels lost but wishes to preserve his fully masculine self has only two choices: withdrawal or rage. We’ve seen what withdrawal and rage have the potential to do. School shootings are only the most public of tragedies. Others, on a smaller scale, take place across the country daily; another commonality among shooters is a history of abuse toward women. To be clear, most men will never turn violent. Most men will turn out fine. Most will learn to navigate the deep waters of their feelings without ever engaging in any form of destruction. Most will grow up to be kind. But many will not. We will probably never understand why any one young man decides to end the lives of others. But we can see at least one pattern and that pattern is glaringly obvious. It’s boys. I believe in boys. I believe in my son. Sometimes, though, I see him, 16 years old, swallowing his frustration, burying his worry, stomping up the stairs without telling us what’s wrong, and I want to show him what it looks like to be vulnerable and open but I can’t. Because I was a boy once, too. There has to be a way to expand what it means to be a man without losing our masculinity. I don’t know how we open ourselves to the rich complexity of our manhood. I think we would benefit from the same conversations girls and women have been having for these past 50 years. I would like men to use feminism as an inspiration, in the same way that feminists used the civil rights movement as theirs. I’m not advocating a quick fix. There isn’t one. But we have to start the conversation. Boys are broken, and I want to help. Michael Ian Black (@michaelianblack) is a comedian, actor and author.

Opinion,241," Supported by By Thomas L. Friedman Cameron Kasky, a 17-year-old at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who survived last week’s mass shooting, wrote a beautiful essay for CNN.com that declared: “At the end of the day, the students at my school felt one shared experience — our politicians abandoned us by failing to keep guns out of schools. But this time, my classmates and I are going to hold them to account. This time we are going to pressure them to take action. This time we are going to force them to spend more energy protecting human lives than unborn fetuses.” Cameron, God bless you for that sentiment. But just one piece of respectful advice: If your generation and mine want to get serious about a gun control crusade, we all need to get out of Facebook and into someone’s face: the N.R.A.’s. This fight can’t be won on Twitter or Instagram. They do get people into the streets. But social media have created a world of faux activism — “Hey, I tweeted about it” — that the bad guys take advantage of. The N.R.A. is not just in the chat rooms. It’s in the cloakrooms of Congress and state legislatures. And it’s there with bags of money and votes it uses to reward lawmakers who do its bidding and hurt those who don’t. I loved seeing the 100 students from your high school taking buses Tuesday to Florida’s capital to directly press lawmakers. That’s a great start. I hope every high school follows. But, ultimately, nothing will change unless young and old who oppose the N.R.A. run for office, vote, help someone vote, register someone to vote or help fund someone’s campaign — so we can threaten the same electoral pain as the National Rifle Association, which, according to PolitiFact, spent $203.2 million between 1998 and 2017 funding its candidates, defeating gun control advocates and lobbying. This is not about persuading people with better ideas. We tried that. It’s about generating raw electoral power and pain. Because most of the G.O.P. members of Congress who do the N.R.A.’s bidding care about only one thing: their jobs. The pay of a typical congressman is $174,000 — and free parking at Reagan National Airport — and they will sell themselves to whoever can generate the votes to enable them to keep both. Are some Democratic lawmakers cowards, too? You bet. But I can show you plenty who have bucked their party’s orthodoxies on education and trade and who insisted that their much-admired colleague Senator Al Franken had to resign over sexual harassment allegations. And most of them have long dared to lose elections to oppose the N.R.A. This is primarily a G.O.P. problem today. How do we know that? Read the paper or the web. The G.O.P., which claimed to stand for conservative family values, has prostrated itself before the most indecent person to ever occupy the White House — a man who lies as he breathes, smears poor, nonwhite nations and reportedly had sex with a porn star shortly after his wife delivered their son. But G.O.P. lawmakers are mute on this because President Trump energizes their base and ensures their $174,000-a-year jobs and free parking at Reagan National Airport. This is a party whose evangelicals have been telling us for decades that life is so sacred the G.O.P. must oppose abortion — even in the case of rape, incest or risk to the mother’s life. But Republicans won’t back common-sense gun laws that would protect fully developed human beings — because the N.R.A. energizes their base and funds their campaigns and ensures their $174,000-a-year jobs and free parking at Reagan National Airport. This is a party whose “Freedom Caucus” was so obsessed with our rising national debt that it tried to prevent Barack Obama from spending a dime to stimulate our economy after it went deep into recession — but just voted to add $1 trillion to the debt for a corporate tax cut without regard for the burden put on our kids. Republicans did so because Trump energizes their base and ensures that they keep their $174,000-a-year jobs and free parking at Reagan National Airport. Trying to embarrass them to act on principle is wasted breath. I suspect they’re already embarrassed. When these G.O.P. lawmakers are alone at home contemplating the pictures of all these kids gunned down in Florida — thinking about what it’d be like to be one of their parents — plenty of them probably feel filthy for doing the N.R.A.’s bidding. They know full well that most voters are not asking to scrap the Second Amendment, but for common-sense gun laws that could prevent or reduce more school shootings and would not interfere with any decent Americans’ right to own guns for hunting, sports or self-protection. They know full well that a common-sense banning of all military assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, or mandating universal background checks for gun buyers or to prevent terrorists and the mentally ill from buying guns, would not curb the constitutional right to bear arms. They know full well that they’re in the grip of an N.R.A. cult, whose heart is so frozen, it’s content to watch innocent children and adults get gunned down weekly — rather than impose common-sense gun limits. They know all of this — but they suppress it, because they also know if they vote for common-sense gun laws, the N.R.A. will fund their next opponent. Like I said, this is just about raw naked power, and that is what sensible gun control advocates have to generate more of now — in the form of votes and campaign funding. Otherwise nothing changes. Keep speaking out, Cameron — but never underestimate what some people will do for a $174,000 job and free parking at Reagan National Airport. Frank Bruni is off today.

National,242," By JULIE TURKEWITZFEB. 19, 2018 TAMARAC, Fla. — The shooting was all over, but the emotional reckoning had just begun, and so on Saturday the teachers of Broward County packed their union hall to discuss what it meant to have become the nation’s human shields. “Last night I told my wife I would take a bullet for the kids,” said Robert Parish, a teacher at an elementary school just miles from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, where a former student killed 17 people, including three staff members who found themselves in the line of fire. Since the attack last week, said Mr. Parish, “I think about it all the time.” Across the country, teachers are grappling with how their roles have expanded, from educator and counselor to bodyguard and protector. They wonder if their classrooms are properly equipped, if they would recognize the signs of a dangerous student, and most of all, if they are prepared to jump in front of a bullet. In the last few days, teachers wrote to Congress, urging bans on assault weapons, and to state lawmakers, seeking permission to carry firearms to school. They attended local protests and reviewed safety plans with students. And in the evenings, they spoke with friends and family about an excruciating reality — that teachers, who once seemed mostly removed from the life-or-death risks faced by the ranks of police officers and firefighters, might now be vulnerable. “I visualized what it would look like, and it made me sick,” said Catherine Collett, 28, a sixth-grade teacher in Northern Virginia who has spent recent days running through a thousand violent scenarios. “Could I empty out the cabinet and throw out the shelves and put kids in the cabinets? Is my better chance just barricading the doors? Can I move furniture that fast? Do I ask my kids to help me?” Many teachers said even contemplating such worries felt far from what they had once imagined their challenges would be. As if the mounting pressures of test scores and email messages to parents and bus duty and hall duty and new certifications and all those meetings wasn’t enough. But the death toll has piled up — staff killed in shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012 and now at Stoneman Douglas in Florida — and is forcing a shift in how teachers view their responsibilities. “When I started teaching, I thought I was just coming in to teach,” said José Luis Vilson, 36, a middle school math teacher in New York City. Now he has come to view himself as a first responder, too, and added that instruction on topics such as conflict resolution and first aid would be useful. Bo Greene, 56, a calculus and statistics teacher in Bar Harbor, Me., said the planning for dangerous situations had increased and grown more specific in the last year, even in her quiet school district. All of it feels jarring after decades in education, she added. “I never had any of this,” Ms. Greene said. “We had the basic fire drills.” Nowhere was the conversation among teachers more intense than in Broward County, where Stoneman Douglas is one of more than 300 schools, and Nikolas Cruz, charged in the shooting, had been among the district’s 270,000 students. Laurel Holland, who was Mr. Cruz’s 11th-grade English teacher, said teachers in big public schools cannot possibly be expected to look into every student’s background to know if they have long been troubled. The year that she taught Mr. Cruz, she had more than 150 students, she said. “There’s not enough time,” she said. In the case of Mr. Cruz, she said, it was clear something was wrong. “He didn’t work and play well with others,” she said. “I was frightened.” Ms. Holland eventually reported him to the administration, and he was removed from her class after one semester. Inside the crowded union building on Saturday, educators held hands and shouted “Union strong!” before getting down to business. How, they asked, were they going to stop the next one? For hours they spoke of the golf clubs and baseball bats they would like to keep in their classrooms, of the bulletproof vests they wish they had, of the challenges of removing mass killers from their midst.      “I’m curious to know, out of the people here, how many Nikolases they have at their school?” said Elizabeth Sundin, 48, a teacher’s assistant. “Because I have one at our school.” Outside, in the balmy Florida night, Mr. Parish, 51, of Broadview Elementary, was wrestling with the question of the class door. When an armed attacker begins to prowl, and a student is left in the hall, “Do I let the kid in, and maybe the gunman behind her?” he said. “Or do I not let them in and save the whole class? That’s a decision I can’t make.” Inside, under the glare of fluorescent lights, Bruce Klasner, 61, of Everglades High was wondering why the district had not created a text message system that could send instructions in the event of an attack. “I teach the Holocaust,” he shouted at the rows of exhausted teachers. “I taught them,” he said of his students, “about a man by the name of Janusz Korczak who walked into the gas chambers with his children because he refused to leave them. And after this happened my kids are sitting outside saying, ‘Mr. K, would you give your life for me?’” Mr. Klasner said he would — of course. “I said, ‘Did you even have to ask?’” In a corner, Andrea Suarez, 35, of Westpine Middle School was worried about her own students, who have special needs and often make loud noises, meaning it is almost impossible to hide them. These days, she said her plan for responding to a shooting involves corralling the children into a closet, occupying them with snacks, and positioning herself in front of the closet door with a pair of sharp scissors. “I’ve been having a lot of difficulty sleeping,” said Ms. Suarez, whose four children have been urging her to leave the profession. “I keep hearing kids screaming and gunshots in my head.” Here in Tamarac, the union meeting was wrapping up. Jim Gard, in cargo pants and a union polo, stood outside, amid palm trees. At 58, he has been a teacher for 36 years, he said, and works at Stoneman Douglas. When the shooting broke out, he was in math class, not far from where many were shot. He had taught Mr. Cruz, as well as two of the dead. “You know, if I go through my college transcripts — master’s degree, doctorate courses, all that — I know for sure there are no courses that say: ‘Shooter on Campus 101,’” he said. The Broward County school district announced on Monday that staff members would return to Stoneman Douglas at the end of the week. Classes are expected to resume on Tuesday, Feb. 27. Mr. Gard said many of his colleagues were struggling with the idea of returning. And yet, he said, “I want to go back. I want to go back to my kids. I want to go back to my classroom. I want to see the kids, I want to teach the kids — and that’s the bottom line.” Jess Bidgood contributed reporting from Boston, Patricia Mazzei from New York, Neil Reisner from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Kitty Bennett from St. Petersburg, Fla.

Opinion,243," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Amy Barnhorst SACRAMENTO — A few years ago, the police brought a 21-year-old man into the crisis unit where I work as an emergency psychiatrist. His parents had called the police after seeing postings on his Facebook page that praised the Columbine shooters, referred to imminent death and destruction at his community college and promised his own “Day of Retribution.” His brother reported to the police that he had recently purchased a gun. When I interviewed the patient, he denied all of this. He had no history of mental illness and said he didn’t want or need any treatment. My job was to evaluate whether he met the criteria to be involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Each mass shooting reignites a debate about what causes this type of violence and how it can be prevented. Those who oppose further restrictions on gun ownership often set their sights on the mental health care system. Shouldn’t psychiatrists be able to identify as dangerous someone like Nikolas Cruz, the young man charged in the school shooting last week in Florida, who scared his classmates, hurt animals and left menacing online posts? Mr. Cruz had suffered from depression and was getting counseling at one point. He was also evaluated by emergency mental health workers in 2016, but they decided not to hospitalize him. Why, some critics are demanding, didn’t he receive proper treatment? And can’t we just stop angry, unstable young men like him from buying firearms? It’s much harder than it sounds. The mental health system doesn’t identify most of these people because they don’t come in to get care. And even if they do, laws designed to preserve the civil liberties of people with mental illness place limits on what treatments can be imposed against a person’s will. Here in California, as in most states, patients must be a danger to themselves or others because of mental illness before they can be involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital. This is a mechanism for getting people into treatment when they are too deep in the throes of their illness to understand that they need it. It allowed me to hospitalize a woman who tried to choke her mother because she was convinced her family had been replaced with impostors, and a man who had sent threatening letters to his boss because he believed she had implanted a microchip in his brain. But the young man who had written about shooting his classmates was calm, cooperative and polite. The posts, he insisted, were nothing more than online braggadocio. He denied being suicidal or homicidal; he had never heard voices or gotten strange messages from the television. He admitted to having been bullied and was resentful of classmates who seemed to have more thriving social and romantic lives. But he adamantly denied he would be violent toward them. What options did I have? It was clear to me that he did not have a psychiatric illness that would justify an involuntary hospitalization, but I was reluctant to release this man whose story echoed that of so many mass shooters. I could fudge it a little, claiming to need more time for observation, and admit him to the hospital anyway. But within the week he would go before a hearing officer to contest being held against his will. The hearing officer would probably come to the same conclusion I had, that he was not dangerous because of a mental illness, and he would be free to go. The only advantage of this version of events would be that the order to release the man who might be the next mass shooter would not be signed with my pen. Maybe the hearing officer would share my trepidation and commit him out of fear of the alternative. Then the hospital would have 14 more days to treat him. The psychiatrist responsible for his care would know how to treat delusions, paranoia, mania, suicidal impulses, self-injurious behaviors, auditory hallucinations and catatonia. But there are no reliable cures for insecurity, resentment, entitlement and hatred. The one concrete benefit of officially committing him would be that he could be prohibited from buying a gun from any federally licensed retailer. Of course, this would do nothing about any guns and ammunition he may already have amassed. Nor would it deter him from getting guns from private-party sales, which are exempt from background checks in many states. I ended up admitting this patient, and he was released by the hearing officer two days later. He never took any medication, never reached the threshold for a federal firearm prohibition and left the hospital in the same state he arrived in. Like so many of his peers, he will not seek out therapy for the longstanding personality traits that seem to predispose him to violence and rage, and there is no way to impose treatment upon him. The reason the mental health system fails to prevent mass shootings is that mental illness is rarely the cause of such violence. Even if all potential mass shooters did get psychiatric care, there is no reliable cure for angry young men who harbor violent fantasies. And the laws intended to stop the mentally ill from buying guns are too narrow and easily sidestepped; people like Nikolas Cruz and my patient are unlikely to qualify. Instead of hoping that imposing mental health treatment on everyone who shows “red flags” will put an end to mass shootings, we should focus on ways to put some distance between these young men and their guns.

One after another, companies under pressure from survivors of the Florida mass shooting are ending their relationships with the National Rifle Association. Avis, Hertz, Delta, United, MetLife and others have all done so since last week. But at least one major company has refused so far: FedEx. FedEx offers N.R.A. members up to a 26 percent discount — the sort that the other companies have chosen to end. “Wait does @FedEx still support the NRA?” David Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the site of the Feb. 14 shooting, tweeted this weekend. Many students have called for a boycott of companies that support the N.R.A. In the case of FedEx, there are obvious alternatives: U.P.S., DHL and the Postal Service. Ending a discount program won’t, in and of itself, save any lives or cause great political damage to the N.R.A. But the FedEx situation has now become something of a test case of the new anti-gun movement. It’s also a test case for whether a major company feels comfortable allying itself with a group that effectively promotes violence. So I’m with the students on this one: I encourage you not to use FedEx so long as it’s comfortable siding with the N.R.A. Voter turnout. My column this morning is about the biggest opportunity and biggest challenge for progressives: Voter turnout. Progressives don’t vote at the same rate as conservatives do. In the most recent midterm election — in 2014 — only 16 percent of American citizens between the ages of 18 and 29 voted, for example. That group also happened to be overwhelmingly liberal. Among citizens who were at least 60 years old — a demographic group that leans conservative — 55 percent voted in 2014. For more of these stark statistics, check out the chart that’s running with my column. And while the vote-suppression efforts of the Republican Party are certainly odious, they’re not the main reason for low turnout. Consider: Which big, left-leaning demographic group has the highest turnout? The same one that is the target of the worst suppression campaigns: African-Americans. The new progressive energy inspired by the Trump presidency is certainly exciting. It has helped lift turnout in a couple of recent elections, too. To win lasting victories, though, turnout will need to rise substantially. For more on this subject, check out the statistics kept by Michael P. McDonald of the University of Florida. The recent analysis of special elections by the Daily Kos Elections team is also worth reading. And I recommend a new piece in Democracy journal by Lara Putnam and Theda Skocpol. Memo wars. Two weeks ago, President Trump blocked the release of a memo that House Democrats wrote in response to a Republican memo on the Russia investigation. On Saturday, the House Intelligence Committee — controlled by Republicans, because they’re in the majority — finally released the Democratic memo. “If the Democrats are being even generally accurate as to the material that the majority omitted from the original memo,” argue Lawfare’s Quinta Jurecic and Benjamin Wittes, “then there is little left of the original document” that holds up to scrutiny.

Washington,245," Supported by By Linda Qiu and Kitty Bennett President Trump said on Monday that his administration would leave it to states to set an age limit for buying assault rifles. It was a reversal of weeks of repeated promises to act, and the latest of years of conflicting positions he has taken on a range of gun issues, from background checks to arming teachers.  Mr. Trump has said he supports requiring background checks for gun purchases, and at various times has even called for strengthening such measures. However, he has also questioned whether background checks work and opposed expanding the system.  October 1999:  “I favor you have to go through a process, but the fact is that the bad ones already have one, and they’re not going to go through a process either; they’re not going to go through any process.” — Interview on CNN. 2000: “I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. With today’s Internet technology we should be able to tell within seventy-two hours if a potential gun owner has a record.” — “The America We Deserve.”  May 16, 2013: 2015:  “Unfortunately, as expected, bringing more government regulation into the situation has accomplished very little. The main ‘benefit’ has been to make it difficult for a law-abiding American to buy a gun. As study after study has proven, few criminals are stupid enough to try to pass a background check or have their names in any kind of system.” — “Great Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America.” September 2015:  “What we need to do is fix the system we have and make it work as intended. What we don’t need to do is expand a broken system.” — Campaign position paper. Feb. 21, 2018:  “We’re going to be very strong on background checks. We’re going to be doing very strong background checks.” — Listening session with teachers and students. While the ban was in place, Mr. Trump voiced his support. Fifteen years later, he called it a “total failure.” He recently suggested that he was open to at least considering a new ban on assault weapons sales. 2000:  “I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons.” — “The America We Deserve.”  2015:  “Gun and magazine bans are a total failure. That’s been proven every time it’s been tried. ... The government has no business dictating what types of firearms good, honest people are allowed to own.” — Campaign position paper. Feb. 28, 2018:  Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California: “This is when the 10-year assault weapon ban was in — how incidents and deaths dropped. When it ended, you see it going up. So Senator Murphy —” Mr. Trump: “So we’ll take a look at it.” Ms. Feinstein: “— and 26 of us have co-sponsored a new bill. I would be most honored if you would take a look at it.” Mr. Trump: “I will. I will.” — Meeting with lawmakers. After repeatedly and vociferously recommending that the age restriction for buying rifles and shotguns be raised to 21 from 18, Mr. Trump walked back his promise and suggested it was up to states to decide.  Feb. 22, 2018:  “We’re going to work on getting the age up to 21 instead of 18. We’re getting rid of the bump stocks.” — Listening session with local and state officials on school safety.  Feb. 28, 2018: March 12, 2018: In the wake of school shootings since at least 2015, Mr. Trump has proposed arming teachers  — only to deny that he ever took such a position days, or mere moments, later.  Jan. 7, 2016:  “I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and — you have to — and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, O.K.?” — Rally in Burlington, Vt.  May 21, 2016:  May 22, 2016:  “You look at some of our schools — unbelievable what’s going on. But I’m not advocating guns in classrooms. But remember, in some cases — and a lot of people have made this case — teachers should be able to have guns. Trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms.” — Interview on Fox News. Feb. 21, 2018: Feb. 22, 2018:  Feb. 22, 2018:  “I don’t want teachers to have guns. I want certain highly adept people, people that understand weaponry, guns — if they really have that aptitude. ... But you could have concealed on the teachers.” — Listening session with local and state officials on school safety.  For decades, Mr. Trump consistently has said he supports the right to bear arms. But he has sometimes suggested confiscating the guns of certain segments of the population.  October 1999:  “If you could take the guns away from the bad guys, and there are plenty of them out there, I’m all for it, but you can’t. Now, if you had a law that says no guns, the people that are law abiding are going to go by that law, but the bad guys aren’t, so they’re going to have all the guns and the good guys aren’t.” “Look, there’s nothing I like better than nobody has them, but that’s not going to happen, Larry. So, as long as that’s not going to happen, I say you have to be allowed to have a gun.” — Interview on CNN. Nov. 18, 1999:  “Well, I think you have to have the right to have a gun. Now, I hate the concept of guns. I’m not in favor of it, except for one thing: The bad guys are going to have them.” — Interview on MSNBC. 2015:  “We have to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental health issues. The fact that people with mental health problems can obtain guns is not right.” — “Great Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America.”  Aug. 4, 2015 “And you have some very sick people that shouldn’t have guns, and we’re all into that and everybody agrees with that.” — Interview on MSNBC. September 2015: “The Second Amendment to our Constitution is clear. The right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. Period.” — Campaign position paper. Feb. 4, 2016: “I won’t let them take away our guns!!” — Facebook post. Sept. 26, 2016:  “You do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn’t be having it.”  — First presidential debate. Feb. 28, 2018: “I like taking the guns early, like in this crazy man’s case that just took place in Florida. He had a lot of firearms. They saw everything. To go to court would have taken a long time. So you could do exactly what you’re saying, but take the guns first, go through due process second.” — Meeting with lawmakers.

Washington,246," By MICHAEL D. SHEARFEB. 20, 2018 President Trump announced his support for regulating items like the so-called bump stock, which was used in the mass shooting in Las Vegas. WASHINGTON — President Trump — under pressure from angry, grieving students from a Florida high school where a gunman killed 17 people last week — ordered the Justice Department on Tuesday to issue regulations banning so-called bump stocks, which convert semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons like those used last year in the massacre of concertgoers in Las Vegas. A day earlier, Mr. Trump signaled that he was open to supporting legislation that would modestly improve the national gun background check system, and on Tuesday night, he posted on Twitter that Democrats and Republicans “must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!” But Mr. Trump’s first embrace as president of any gun control measures was dismissed by gun control supporters as minor. The National Rifle Association supports the background check legislation and also backs bump stock regulation, although not an outright ban. Speaking at the White House days after a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Mr. Trump said that he had directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to develop the regulations.  “We cannot merely take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference,” Mr. Trump said at a ceremony as he conferred the medal of valor on public safety officials. “We must actually make a difference.”  In Florida on Tuesday, the Republican-controlled State House rejected an effort to immediately consider a bill to ban large-capacity magazines and the type of assault rifles used in last week’s attack, even as students from Stoneman Douglas High School watched from the gallery. The party-line vote was on an unusual procedural motion offered by a Democrat, and Republican leaders were critical of the effort to force a vote. They said they would consider other gun control bills before the session ends in March, but none of those measures is expected to go as far as banning assault rifles. 
                “Bump stocks” are attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster, almost like machine guns. Twelve of the rifles found in the hotel room of the Las Vegas gunman were fitted with the devices.             At the White House, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the president’s spokeswoman, said the president was determined to find ways to protect Americans, and especially children, from gunmen. Asked about a broader ban on assault weapons, Ms. Sanders said the White House has not “closed the door on any front.” Despite the day’s developments, there was deep skepticism in Washington that anything would change because of the long history of inaction by state and federal politicians after similar mass shootings. Gun control activists said they were braced for another disappointing battle with lawmakers. The president, they noted, promised unwavering fealty last year to the National Rifle Association, drawing thunderous applause at its annual convention by declaring, “To the N.R.A., I can proudly say I will never, ever let you down.” The group in turn enthusiastically endorsed Mr. Trump and spent $30 million on his campaign. Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who sponsored the latest background check measure with Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said he was unimpressed by Mr. Trump’s openness to it. “Let’s not pretend this is some huge concession on his part,” he said. “If this is all the White House is willing to do to address gun violence, it’s wholly insufficient.” The background check bill, which seeks to improve the existing database used to prevent gun purchases by criminals and the mentally ill, is a small nod in the direction of gun control that does nothing to close loopholes that allow millions of gun sales without a background check. Last year, N.R.A. officials said they were fine with it.  It is also unclear whether Mr. Trump’s statement of support for the measure, which included a desire for some “revisions,” might be linked to other legislation that the N.R.A. backs. In the House, a similar background check measure was combined with legislation that would effectively allow people to legally carry concealed weapons in all 50 states. That legislation is the top priority for the N.R.A., and gun control activists have promised to fight it aggressively. “That normalizes the carrying of guns on all American streets,” said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a group that advocates gun control measures. He said joining the two measures would be a “craven” bait-and-switch and “disrespectful for all the families” of the Florida school that suffered through last week’s shooting. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     The president’s bump stock announcement surprised the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which did not appear to have been informed of the pending remarks from Mr. Trump. The Justice Department announced a review of the devices in early December. Led by the A.T.F., the review sought to determine whether the bureau — which is responsible for policing firearms — was able to regulate the devices without action from Congress. Under the Obama administration, the bureau had determined it could not regulate them. Given that prior position, A.T.F. officials had indicated privately in the months after the Las Vegas massacre that any ban of bump stocks would require new legislation. Bump stocks were not used on the rifle in the shooting last week in Florida, the authorities said. Mr. Trump’s announcement on Tuesday appeared to short-circuit the agency’s review. The A.T.F. had not yet determined whether it had the authority to ban the devices when Mr. Trump directed Mr. Sessions to draft a regulation doing so. In a statement, an A.T.F. official said she was “not authorized to comment on pending legislation, legislative proposals or the possibility of executive action.” A Justice Department spokesman said that the department “understands this is a priority for the president.” The shooting in Florida prompted the White House to highlight the administration’s actions as students from the school included Mr. Trump among the politicians they criticized for failing to keep them safe.  In an impassioned speech on Saturday, Emma Gonzalez, a senior at the school, assailed the president’s N.R.A. ties and accused him of setting a crass monetary value on the lives of gunshot victims by taking so much money from the gun-rights group. “If you don’t do anything to prevent this from continuing to occur, that number of gunshot victims will go up and the number that they are worth will go down,” Ms. Gonzalez said on Saturday at a rally for gun control. “And we will be worthless to you.” With funerals underway for those who died at the Florida high school, Mr. Trump said that he plans to host a “listening session” on Wednesday with high school students and teachers at the White House. He is scheduled to meet on Thursday with state and local officials to discuss school safety. Ms. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that the session on Wednesday will include students and parents from the Florida school as well as people affected by school shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. She did not say whether any of the student activists who have been critical of Mr. Trump were invited to the White House.

First: “I don’t think we could have been more prepared than we were today,” Melissa Falkowski, a teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, said Wednesday on MSNBC. The school had an armed security guard and ran regular lockdown drills. And yet: “Even with that, we still have 17 casualties,” Falkowski said. “Seventeen people that aren’t going to return to their families.” Lockdown drills aren’t enough. Armed security guards aren’t enough. There is only one way to prevent mass shootings in schools. And it’s not exactly a secret. It’s the approach used by every other affluent country in the world, none of which suffers from regular mass shootings. The solution is stricter gun laws. Do we care enough about our children to protect them from being shot? The issue really is that straightforward. Dreamers. In politics, as in most of life, what people do matters more than what they say. So forget for a minute about what President Trump keeps saying about the Dreamers — that he cares about them — and focus on his actions: First, he went out of his way to cancel their legal protection from deportation, a cancellation scheduled to take effect in March. Then Trump rejected an emerging bipartisan deal to restore those protections. And this week he announced that he wouldn’t restore the protections unless Congress passed a long list of other fairly radical immigration changes, like a border wall and sharply reduced legal immigration. The Plum Line’s Greg Sargent has put together a more detailed version of this timeline. Vox’s Ezra Klein wrote: “Trump doesn’t want a fix for Dreamers but he does want a suite of unpopular changes that he’s holding Dreamers hostage to pass. This is his crisis, and he shouldn’t be allowed to confuse that.” What can Democrats do? They are the minority party, and they can’t force Trump to change his policy, as I’ve argued before — frustrating as that may be. They also shouldn’t give into his demands for radical immigration changes and encourage more political hostage-taking. (Greisa Martinez Rosas, a prominent advocate for Dreamers, makes the same point in Sargent’s piece.) In the end, the choice is Trump’s. Democrats and Dreamer advocates can lobby him and other Republicans, hoping to put political pressure on them, as happened on health care last year. But Trump will ultimately have a decision to make. Sometime in the next few weeks, he will have to decide whether he is really willing to allow federal law enforcement to begin deporting people from the country they call home. Related: A Cato Institute study finds that eliminating the Dreamers’ protections would cost the federal government more than $9 billion a year in tax revenue. Instead of staying in the United States, working and paying taxes, many people would instead be forced to leave. The end of the protections, the authors wrote, “would represent a significant cost to the United States Treasury and the broader economy.” Bannon and Yellen. The paperback edition of Joshua Green’s book about Steve Bannon, “Devil’s Bargain” — which just came out — has a fascinating anecdote about Trump’s search for a Federal Reserve chair. Bannon supported the reappointment of Janet Yellen, despite their obvious political differences, because he correctly understood that Yellen’s policies were good for economic growth. “If we get behind her, that is the signal of signals — the realignment of American politics,” Bannon told Green. But he ultimately decided not to push the White House to reappoint her. I assume he understood that Trump didn’t want to reappoint Yellen mostly because Barack Obama had appointed her. As has so often been the case with Bannon, he was willing to talk about a Republican Party that put a greater emphasis on middle-class economic interests, but he wasn’t willing to do much about it. Related: Ross Douthat argues that, somewhat accidentally, the Trump administration has recently turned in a more Bannonesque and populist direction. It’s not just airplanes. “Pet owners increasingly treat their animals as full-fledged members of the family and extensions of themselves — and expect everyone else to treat them that way as well,” Virginia Postrel writes for Bloomberg View. “The fights over emotional-support animals in the air could be the start of a long and nasty struggle.” You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook.

Opinion,248," Supported by By David Leonhardt This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. It’s hard to imagine a worse distinction for a country to hold. A recent study in the journal Health Affairs concluded that the United States has become “the most dangerous of wealthy nations for a child to be born into.” Perhaps most damning, our country didn’t used to hold this status. In the 1960s, the death rate of American children was slightly lower than in other affluent nations. But three factors have changed that: 1. Other countries have had far more success reducing infant mortality. The reasons aren’t fully known, but the uneven American social safety net seems to play a role. 2. Other countries have more sharply reduced vehicle deaths, which are a particular scourge for teenagers. (The United States could easily do the same, as I explained in a recent column.) 3. The United States suffers from an epidemic of shooting deaths, which are nearly nonexistent elsewhere. The gun homicide rate in this country is 49 times higher than in other rich countries, according to the Health Affairs study. By now, you’ve probably heard about the at least 17 people, mostly high-school students, murdered in South Florida yesterday. You’ve also probably heard a lot of substance-free condolences. Here’s the truth: The teenagers killed in Florida yesterday had the misfortune of growing up — of trying to grow up — in a country that didn’t care enough about their lives. May we honor them with anger that does not cease until the unnecessary deaths of children do. Related: Nick Kristof argues for a public-health approach to gun violence.

There are several promising ways to reduce gun deaths in the United States, as Nick Kristof has explained. Arming the nation’s teachers is, of course, not one of them. As the civil-rights activist Michael Skolnik tweeted yesterday: The issue of gun violence in America isn’t just school shootings.A teacher with a gun wouldn’t have saved:Vegas: a concertOrlando: a nightclubSutherland Springs: a churchAurora: a movie theaterGabby Giffords: a parking lotTrayvon Martin: a neighborhoodMike Brown: a cop Food confusion. The scientific research on what constitutes a healthy diet can sure seem confusing. One study says that one thing is good for you. A few years later, another study says that the same thing is bad for you — or doesn’t matter. The latest research seems to add to the confusion. Experts have long emphasized the importance of how many calories a person eats — either to stay healthy or lose weight. By contrast, a new study found that “the key to weight loss is diet quality, not quantity,” as The Times headline put it. But don’t despair. The evidence on healthy eating is actually quite consistent. It’s not very complicated, either. Study after study — as well as common sense — suggests that most people should eat a varied diet, heavy on vegetables, fruits, whole grains and proteins. They should minimize the amount of processed food and added sugars. Most Americans would benefit by cutting back on sugars and junk food. If you follow this advice, you don’t need to worry so much about the amount you eat, because it’s difficult to overeat most natural foods. When you’re eating, say, a salad, fish, whole-grain garlic bread and an apple, you’ll tend to stop eating when you’ve consumed a healthy number of calories. You will be full. When you’re eating, say, fried chicken and ice cream, you won’t naturally stop (unless you have a lot more self-control than I do). There is no need to follow every twist and turn in food research, as if the expert consensus were frequently changing. It’s not. Focus on the big picture, which is quite clear. The real issue for most people isn’t figuring out what to do. It’s figuring out how to do it. Related: My column on one approach to eating less sugar. I’ll have more to say about eating habits in an upcoming column. One citizen, one vote. Voting rights have been a recent theme of this newsletter, and the political scientist Daniel Nichanian has a good Op-Ed on the subject today. He writes: “New Jersey, a state that trails most of its neighbors in terms of ensuring that all of its citizens have the right to vote, now has the opportunity to carry out such an unapologetic agenda of voting rights restoration.” Podcast recommendation. “I feel like I’m still writing to let my 10-year-old self know it’s O.K. to be you.

Opinion,253," Supported by Letter To the Editor: Re “A Shooting at YouTube’s Offices Rattles Silicon Valley” (news article, April 4): The shooting on Tuesday at YouTube’s headquarters in California is among the latest to draw the attention of the national news media since the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, and was accompanied by the usual “thoughts and prayers.” Countless deaths continue to be routine in inner cities and receive much less attention. The terms “active shooter,” “shooting survivor,” “lone shooter,” “mass shooting,” “lockdown,” “magazine” and “bump stock” have sadly become part of our lexicon. The numbing of Americans to gun violence is unique to our country, and the inaction by Congress to protect us is a national tragedy. FELICE BUSTOOCEAN GROVE, N.J.

The retailer said Tuesday that it is in the process of destroying all the firearms it pulled from its shelves, rather than trying to return them to their manufacturers. Dicks made headlines in February when, in the aftermath of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it banned the sale of assault-style rifles and the sale of all guns to anyone under 21. Other retailers followed suit, including Walmart, which also raised its minimum-age rules for firearms. Dick's is based in the Pittsburgh area.

She made no mention of the advertisers who had abandoned her own program after she tweeted that a survivor of the Parkland, Florida school shooting had ""whined"" about not getting in to some colleges he had applied for. That high school senior, David Hogg, responded by suggesting that people offended by Ingraham's remark contact her advertisers. Some 19 companies responded by saying they wouldn't air commercials on Ingraham's show. Ingraham was on vacation for a week after apologizing via social media for her tweet. She hasn't discussed that episode with her viewers specifically, but it didn't take much reading between the lines to realize it was on her mind Monday. Ingraham even played a video clip of Bill Maher saying some liberals have defended free speech; Maher last week came out against a boycott of Ingraham's program.  She said that ""left wing retaliatory hit squads"" respond to speech that makes them uncomfortable by trying to evict opponents from the public square instead of debating their ideas.

None,261," By REUTERSAPRIL 21, 2018, 6:04 A.M. E.D.T. LOS ANGELES —  Leaders of the student-led anti-gun movement, who inspired classroom walkouts across the country on the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre, say they plan to maintain their activism through the long summer break. This week's protests marked the second mass student walkout since a 19-year-old man opened fire at a Parkland, Florida high school in February, killing 17 people. It signaled the emergence of a growing national campaign led by young people to lessen gun violence and toughen laws on firearms sales. But the movement faces a major early challenge as the traditional three-month summer break approaches for most U.S. public schools at a critical moment in their bid to be heard by politicians in their home states and Washington, D.C. ""The reason why this has been so huge (is that) we're in school, we talk to our classmates, we spread it around, everybody's around so it's kind of easier to show up,"" said Vivian Reynoso, 17, a junior at Tucson High Magnet School in Tucson, Arizona, who helped organize rallies for both nationwide demonstrations in the past month.  ""Of course you fear (losing the momentum),"" said Reynoso, who like her peers in the campaign was born a year or more after the Columbine shootings. ""I'm pretty sure even the Parkland victims are afraid of that. That's why we need to be pushing, even if it's summer, to keep telling people to keep talking about the issue and not to forget to about it.""  In the nearly two decades since Columbine seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went on a shooting rampage in 1999, killing 12 students and a teacher before committing suicide, school shootings have become almost commonplace in the United States. Students at Columbine, which has not held classes on April 20 since the massacre, did not take part in the walkout, and  were encouraged to do community service instead. Even as students prepared for Friday's protests wearing orange, the color of the anti-gun movement, news began trickling out that a 17-year-old student had been wounded in a shooting at a high school near Ocala, Florida, some 225 miles northwest of Parkland. SECOND AMENDMENT The debate over guns in America, where the right to bear arms is protected under the Second Amendment of the Constitution, has raged nearly since the nation's founding. The students hope to succeed where other activists have failed in enacting stricter legislation on gun ownership, either at the state or federal level.      As anger fades over the Parkland shootings, the test for students will be in organizing for gun reform. Many of the protests featured voter registration drives, with students aiming to make it a major issue for midterm elections in November. ""Who knows whether they maintain the energy or not but there are historic examples of student-led movements that have played an important role in moving things forward, (for example) the Civil rights movements,"" said Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""We've seen these kids take a real leadership role on this issue,"" said Winkler, author of a history of the debate over gun control in America. ""Whether they can sustain it not remains to be seen.""  The March 24 ""March For Our Lives"" rallies in cities across the United States were some of the biggest U.S. youth demonstrations in decades, with hundreds of thousands of young Americans and their supporters taking to the streets. Friday's walkouts, though smaller in scale, signaled the determination of the students to press on with their movement. ""The way we're viewing the summer right now is it's really an opportunity to put in a lot of work on some really big plans we have going for the return to school in August,"" said Gavin Pierce, 21, a college junior studying film in Los Angeles and an organizer of the ""March for Our Lives"" pro-gun control group.     ""Everyone is really eager to keep this going and to keep on organizing until we see real change,"" Pierce said.

The Ocala Star-Banner reported that Sky Bouche appeared before Judge Willard Pope via video conference at the Marion County Jail, with a public defender at his side. Pope said he denied bail due to the nature of the charges against Bouche, which include terrorism, aggravated assault with a firearm and carrying a concealed firearm. A second hearing for Bouche was set for May 22. Friday's shooting at Forest High School in Ocala happened on a day planned for a national classroom walkout to protest gun violence and left one person wounded.  Just hours after the shooting, a detailed picture of the troubled teen's life and a possible motive emerged in interviews with detectives and a local newspaper.  The 19-year-old Bouche allegedly told Marion County Sheriff's investigators he considered shooting up a church but settled on a school because ""it creates more attention."" The shooting comes just over two months after a gunman killed 17 people and wounded 17 others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Nikolas Cruz, 19, faces the death penalty if convicted in that Valentine's Day shooting.      Bouche told authorities he purchased the shotgun in a private sale roughly a week after the Parkland shooting. He said there is no paperwork for the 1930 shotgun, and there was no background check because it was a private sale. Detectives said Bouche told them he felt an adrenaline rush Friday morning and was ready for the shooting but said the excitement quickly wore off, and he was unable to carry out his plan. When he first entered the school, he said it was empty so he went to the bathroom and put on a tactical vest and gloves. Bouche told detectives he fired into a classroom door and the shrapnel hit a student in the ankle. The alleged shooter then dropped his weapon and surrendered to one of his former teachers. ""His hands were up and he said he wanted to be arrested ... 'I am mentally ill,'"" Kelly McManis-Panasuk quoted him as saying. She said he told her he didn't think the gun would work. The two talked for about three minutes until the principal and school resource officer took him into custody. Bouche apologized as he was led away in handcuffs. The Star-Banner interviewed Bouche shortly after his arrest. He said his earliest memories are of ""violence and conflict."" The paper didn't elaborate. Bouche said he wanted to join the Marine Corps, but couldn't because he had been committed for a mental health evaluation when he was 14.  ",2018-04-21,0.004534528,Saturday

MIAMI —  A survivor of a mass shooting that killed 17 at a Florida high school in February is calling for a boycott of two of what he says are the biggest investors in gun manufacturers: BlackRock and The Vanguard Group. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School senior David Hogg used the hashtags #BoycottVanguard and #BoycottBlackrock in a Tuesday tweet. Both companies said in statements Wednesday that they offer clients opportunities to select funds that do not include gun manufacturers. Carolyn Wegemann, a spokeswoman for The Vanguard Group, which handles 401 (K) retirement fund plans for many companies including The Associated Press, told AP that 359 of the company's 388 funds do not directly invest in the top three gun manufacturers: AOBC, VSTO and RGR.  Blackrock also said in a statement that it ""regularly speaks"" with gun manufacturers about how they are ensuring the safe, responsible use of their firearms.  Former Stoneman Douglas student Nikolas Cruz, 19, is accused of taking an assault-style rifle to the school and opening fire on students, teachers and staff in one of the buildings on the campus near Fort Lauderdale on Feb. 14. He is charged with 17 counts of first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. Since the shooting, Hogg and many other students from the Parkland, Florida, school anchored a massive rally against gun violence in Washington on March 24, and throngs of young people took part in sister marches around the country. They also led student walkouts from high schools on the one-month anniversary of the shooting, asking for gun-legislation reform.      Their efforts also led to gun reform legislation in Florida, which raised the minimum age to buy rifles from 18 to 21 and extend a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases to include long guns. In the aftermath of the Parkland shooting, Blackrock announced it would offer a new line of products that are exclusively firearm-free. The company said in a statement that the products are available to ""certain institutional investors, including qualified U.S. pension plans such as 401(k) plans."" It is among the steps Blackrock has taken to ""enhance"" its Environmental Social and Governance policy. The Blackrock statement said that in addition to discussing the safe use of their products, the company asks manufacturers how they determine where and how the products are being sold. Vanguard is also meeting with gun manufacturers and distributors to discuss ""how they plan to help prevent such tragedies from happening again,"" Wegemann said. ""Vanguard shares many individuals' concerns about public safety and firearm access and hopes that policymakers take appropriate action to protect Americans from gun violence,"" the company's statement said.

LITTLETON, Colo. —  Colorado gun control activists rallied on Thursday near Columbine High School, calling for an end to gun violence one day before the 19th anniversary of the massacre there and a planned nationwide student walkout. The roughly 200 demonstrators who gathered in the Denver suburb of Littleton on a windy afternoon included a survivor of the Feb. 14 school shooting in Parkland, Florida that left 17 dead. The walkouts and drive to sign up voters are aimed at pressuring U.S. politicians to enact tighter restrictions on gun sales in the run-up to November's mid-term congressional elections. ""The idea is to unite and empower survivors, to stand together,"" said Emmy Adams, an 18-year-old senior at nearby Golden High School.  On April 20, 1999 two Columbine seniors killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher before committing suicide. Since then mass shootings have occurred with shocking frequency across the United States.  Among the speakers at the ""Vote for Our Lives"" event were Parkland High School student Carlitos Rodriguez, who told the crowd that politicians would listen if their seats were at stake. Students from more than 2,600 schools and institutions are expected to walk out of class at 10 a.m. local time on Friday, organizers say. Activists asked students to wear orange, the official color of the campaign against gun violence, and observe a 13-second silence to honor the victims killed at Columbine.      Columbine has not held classes on April 20 since the massacre, a district spokeswoman said, so there would be no walkout at the school. Students were encouraged to take part in community service. The latest national rally comes more than a month after tens of thousands of students from some 3,000 schools participated in the #ENOUGH National School Walkout to demand that lawmakers seek tighter gun control regulations. It also follows ""March For Our Lives"" rallies in cities across the United States on March 24 that were some of the biggest U.S. youth demonstrations for decades, with hundreds of thousands of young Americans and their supporters taking to the streets to demand tighter gun laws. Dudley Brown, president of the Colorado-based National Association for Gun Rights, said the gun-control movement seeks to have the government take away rights, “precisely opposite of what the civil rights activists did in the 1960s.” ""The main objective of these students is to ban firearms completely, and confiscate the firearms of law-abiding Americans,"" Brown said.

An initial and enduring result of the tragedy has been an increase in compassion and empathy for each other, Aztec Public Library director Kate Skinner said.      ""Has it changed us? Yes,"" Skinner said. ""I think it's given us this heightened awareness that human beings are fragile, and that community and society is fragile."" The Aztec Municipal School District has offered students and staff emotional support as needed since the shooting, something Aztec High School Principal Warman Hall said likely will need to continue over the long term to facilitate healing. ""We're at an interesting place where we really understood that for quite a while now, and even coming in the future, we're going to need emotional support providers, probably at least therapists on call or nearby,"" Hall said. Hall also emphasized the importance of increased security on campus. Three unarmed security guards have been patrolling the school since students returned in January, and Aztec police officers stop by the school often, including an additional dedicated school resource officer. ___ Information from: The Daily Times, http://www.daily-times.com  ",2018-04-15,0.004225839,Sunday
None,267," By REUTERSAPRIL 10, 2018, 7:19 P.M. E.D.T. (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp plans to stop lending to companies that make military-style firearms for civilians, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, making it the second major U.S. lender to address gun sales after the Florida high school shooting that left 17 dead in February. The company is in discussions with a few manufacturers who make military-style firearms for civilians, Bank of America's vice chairman, Anne Finucane, told the news agency in an interview. ""It is not our intent to underwrite or finance military style firearms on a go-forward basis,"" she said. A spokesman for Bank of America declined to comment on the report. Last month, Citigroup Inc added restrictions on firearm sales for new retail sector clients, requiring them to sell firearms only to customers who passed a background check, restricting sales for buyers under 21, and not sell so-called bump stocks or high-capacity magazines. The second-deadliest shooting at a U.S. public school re-ignited the long-running national debate over gun rights, pitting many of the students who survived the Feb. 14 high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, against powerful gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association.

National,268," By JESS BIDGOODMARCH 30, 2018 Lawmakers in Vermont, a place long steeped in hunting culture, on Friday approved a sweeping package of new gun restrictions, making the state all but certain to join Florida in passing a raft of new gun control measures after a teenage gunman killed 17 people last month at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, has vowed to sign the measure. It represents a remarkable departure from the state’s existing gun laws, which are some of the weakest in the country — and an about-face for Mr. Scott, who decided to consider new gun control measures only after a teenager was accused of plotting a school shooting in Vermont in the days after the violence in Parkland. “No state is immune to the risk of extreme violence,” Mr. Scott said in a statement on Friday, adding, “If we are at a point when our kids are afraid to go to school and parents are afraid to put their kids on a bus, who are we?” The bill, which passed the Senate, 17 to 13, on Friday after clearing the House earlier in the week, would raise the minimum age to purchase a gun to 21 and ban bump stocks, which are devices that allow semiautomatic rifles to fire more rapidly. It also contains restrictions that go beyond those in the measure signed in Florida, like an expansion of background checks and a limit on the capacity of magazines that can be sold or possessed in the state.  The passage of the bill is likely to be hailed as a victory by activists pushing for tighter gun laws around the nation after the Parkland shootings. It comes less than a week after hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in protest of mass shootings and gun violence — including 2,500 who squeezed onto the steps of the Capitol in Montpelier.  “I think the message that most members of the Legislature — not all — took is that public opinion is changing in Vermont,” said Eric Davis, an emeritus professor of political science at Middlebury College. Madison Knoop, a college freshman who organized last weekend’s march in Montpelier, called the bill’s advancement “such a good first start.” The day after the Parkland shooting, Mr. Scott, a moderate Republican who has kept his distance from President Trump, said he saw no need for new gun laws — a position in line with years of precedent in Vermont, a rural state with a committed population of hunters. Mr. Scott shifted his stance a day later, after a teenager was arrested and accused of planning a school shooting in Fair Haven, Vt. “Everything should be on the table at this point,” Mr. Scott said.      Lawmakers are expected to approve two more gun control measures next week. One would allow law enforcement officers to remove guns from people considered at risk of harming themselves or others, and the other would allow firearms to be taken from people arrested or cited for domestic assault. Some Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the measures that advanced on Friday. State Senator Dick Sears Jr., a Democrat, expressed deep unease with the ban on high-capacity magazines, which had been included in the House bill. And State Senator John Rodgers, a Democrat representing a rural stretch of northern Vermont, mourned a change in the state’s culture before he voted against the bill. “I think maybe if we pass this bill, maybe it is over, maybe the Vermont I grew up with is over, and it’s changed,” Mr. Rodgers said, according to Vermont Public Radio.  On Saturday afternoon, Recoil magazine and Magpul Industries, which makes firearms accessories, were planning to distribute free 30-round magazines at the State House to show their disdain for the expected law. Magazines of that size that are in residents’ possession before the ban goes into effect would not be subject to the law. Evan Hughes, vice president of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs, which was opposed to the legislation, said he would be among the crowd on Saturday. “Our legislators,” he said, “have drastically underestimated the response from the gun-owning community.”  ",2018-03-31,0.0039347094,Saturday

Express,270," By LAURA M. HOLSONAPRIL 18, 2018 Dick’s Sporting Goods plans to destroy the assault-style rifles and accessories it agreed to take off its shelves in February instead of returning them to manufacturers. It is the latest action taken by the Pennsylvania retailer that agreed to ban the sale of assault-style rifles at its 35 Field & Stream stores, and to stop selling firearms and ammunition to anyone younger than 21. Since the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February that left 17 students and staff members dead, corporations have quickly responded to the public’s growing demand for responsible gun control measures. Several retailers agreed to stop selling firearms to consumers younger than 21. Among them are Walmart, the nation’s largest gun seller; L.L. Bean; and Kroger, which said it would restrict gun sales at its Fred Meyer stores. Walmart also agreed to stop selling toys online that look like assault-style rifles. And Kroger announced in March that it would stop selling “assault-rifle themed periodicals.”  “It’s a very good barometer of where the public stands,” said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit organization that seeks to end gun violence. “Corporations tend to reflect their customers.”  The news that Dick’s Sporting Goods would destroy the weapons was first reported last week in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. A spokesman told the paper that the company was in the process of destroying the firearms and accessories no longer for sale, “in accordance with federal guidelines and regulations.” In a significant move by a major bank last month, Citigroup said it would restrict the sale of firearms by its business partners, including those sold to people younger than 21 or people who have not passed background checks. (The restrictions apply to clients who, among other things, raise capital via Citigroup or offer Citigroup-backed credit cards.)      Many Americans have warned corporate America on social media about their feelings toward gun violence, even threatening to boycott brands. Corporations have cut sponsorships and partnerships with the National Rifle Association, which lobbies on behalf of gun makers and raised millions of dollars for the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Hertz and Avis announced they would end discount programs for the N.R.A.’s five million members. Delta and United also issued statements asking the N.R.A. to remove their information from its website. “The message you are getting is that the gun lobby does not represent where the public stands on this issue,” Mr. Feinblatt said. “The N.R.A. does not represent mainstream America.” A spokesman for the N.R.A. declined to comment on the recent moves by retailers, including the decision by Dick’s Sporting Goods to destroy the unsold weapons. 
            .@DICKS decision isn’t focusing on the actual problem, what it is doing is punishing law-abiding citizens. What a waste, and what a strange business model. #DefendTheSecond #2A #NRA https://t.co/mUNmV6O1ot         Edward W. Stack, the chief executive of Dick’s, acknowledged in February that the company sold a shotgun on Nov. 17 to Nikolas Cruz, the Parkland gunman. “It was not the gun, nor type of gun, he used in the shooting,” Mr. Stack said in a statement. “But it could have been.” The company previously stopped selling assault-style weapons at Dick’s stores after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. Under federal law, a person must be at least 21 to buy a handgun from a firearms dealer. But 18-year-olds can buy semiautomatic rifles and other firearms.

National,271," By CHRISTINA CARONAPRIL 11, 2018 A school district in Erie, Pa., has supplied teachers and other school employees with miniature baseball bats to use as a last resort if confronted with an active shooter. “We don’t want to be sitting ducks,” William Hall, superintendent of the Millcreek Township School District, said on Wednesday. “We’re not just going to go hide.” The 18-inch wood bats are also meant to be “symbolic,” he said, to remind people that the old policy of simply turning off the lights, shutting the door and hiding, is not enough. Now, he says, one option is fighting back. “Part of that response is to assess your environment for anything that could be used as a potential weapon or to defend yourself,” he added.  The 600 bats each cost $3, Mr. Hall said, and are akin to a ballpark souvenir. They are no match, of course, for a gunman toting a semiautomatic weapon.  Even so, Mr. Hall said, “I think a bat could disarm a pistol with a nice swing.” Jon Cacchione, the president of the Millcreek teachers’ union, says it’s better than doing nothing. “Is this going to make the difference if we have an active shooter? I don’t know,” he said, but the bats, along with the other changes the district is employing, are “an improvement of what we had before.” The Millcreek school district’s decision to use bats has been panned on Facebook and Twitter, prompting comments ranging from angry to incredulous. “Is this a late April fools joke?” someone asked. Others suggested that conceal and carry was a better solution. “Best to just arm teachers and staff with guns,” one woman wrote. Bonnie Fagan, 56, a Pennsylvania PTA board member whose son graduated from the high school in Millcreek Township said she was “surprised and disappointed to hear money was spent on something along those lines.” Mr. Hall defended his decision. “I think what happens is, after Parkland, things die down and you almost fall back into a false sense of security until it happens again,” Mr. Hall said. “If you have to take a few bumps and bruises because people think it’s silly, I’m O.K. with that.” Matthew Exley, director of the Millcreek Township Office of Emergency Management, said in an email on Wednesday that neither his organization nor the Millcreek Township Police Department was involved in the decision by the Millcreek Township School District to provide bats to teachers.      All 470 of the district’s teachers received the bats on April 2, as did teacher’s aides, administrators and building staff, Mr. Cacchione said.  The idea came from an anonymous response to the district’s online survey distributed about a month after the Parkland, Fla., shooting that killed 17 people, Mr. Hall explained. The survey, which included only one question, asked whether or not parents approved of having an armed presence in schools who would act as “‘first responder(s)’ to an active shooter situation.” The bats are meant to be used only during a “hard lockdown situation,” Mr. Hall said, and are locked up in the district’s buildings and classrooms so they don’t fall into the wrong hands. It’s part of a larger effort to improve school safety, Mr. Hill said, that includes installing a concrete barrier between a parking lot and a walkway, instituting regular police patrols at each of the district’s 10 schools and securing building entrances. The Parkland shooting has led school officials and lawmakers across the country to make changes. Last month, the superintendent of the Blue Mountain School District in Schuylkill County, Pa., announced that every classroom had been equipped with a five-gallon bucket of river stone. “If an armed intruder attempts to gain entrance to any of our classrooms, they will face a classroom full students armed with rocks and they will be stoned,” the superintendent, David Helsel, said at the time. And last month Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where the mass shooting took place in February, announced that it would require students to wear clear backpacks. The Pattonville School District in Missouri is spending $4.3 million on safety and security upgrades, according to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. And the Florida Legislature passed a gun control bill on March 7 that would allow superintendents and sheriffs to arm school personnel. But that move was rejected on Tuesday by the school board in Broward County, Fla. And while Mr. Cacchione said that bats aren’t going to stop an active shooter, “we’re going to keep working at this until we get what’s best.”  ",2018-04-11,0.0037053968,Wednesday

None,273," By REUTERSAPRIL 11, 2018, 7:34 P.M. E.D.T. NEW YORK —  Gun control advocates are planning to send birthday packages to newly turned 18-year-olds in 10 states where they believe pro-gun lawmakers are vulnerable. Inside each: a voter registration form. The effort is part of a teen voter sign-up campaign aimed at electing a gun control-friendly Congress in November by seizing the momentum of a movement driven by young people shaken by gun violence, organizers told Reuters. “I think young people are going to make a huge difference  in this election, and the new energy we're seeing is going to tip the scales in a number of races,"" said Isabelle James, political director for Giffords, which advocates more restrictive gun laws. The campaign, ""Our Lives, Our Votes,"" combines the efforts of Giffords and two other groups following last month's massive rallies inspired by the deadly February school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Organizers said they hoped to register at least 50,000 18- and 19-year-olds in 10 battleground states.  ""America's children took to the streets and led marches with a unified message that rang out across the country: We need a Congress that will protect us,"" former Democratic  Representative Gabrielle Giffords, co-founder of Giffords, said in an emailed statement. Giffords was seriously wounded in a 2011 Arizona shooting rampage.  The other groups behind ""Our Lives, Our Votes"" are Everytown for Gun Safety, which includes more than 1,000 current and former mayors, and NextGen America, a liberal group founded by billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer. Starting with a $1.5 million war chest, organizers said  they would reach teenagers with online voter registration ads as well as the direct-mail birthday packages. BATTLEGROUND STATES Organizers said the elections they were targeting included competitive races for the Senate and House of Representatives in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. Republicans are battling to maintain control of both congressional chambers in the November elections. Although the teen-voter registration campaign is non-partisan, ""the sad political reality is that we do need a Democratic majority (in Congress) because we need leadership that’s willing to work with us and move forward,"" James said. She said, however, that her group supported 20 Republican lawmakers who favor stronger gun laws. The Republican-led Congress has been generally reluctant to impede the sale of guns, in the face of constitutional protection for the right to bear arms and lobbying efforts by pro-gun rights groups including the powerful National Rifle Association.      Last month, however, lawmakers modestly improved background checks and made clear that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could study the causes of gun violence. The Feb. 14 massacre of 17 students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, turned several survivors into household names as youthful advocates for gun control. It also inspired the huge ""March for Our Lives"" in Washington and other cities last month.  Gun control advocates have called for nationwide background checks on gun buyers, a 21-year-old minimum age for gun ownership and a ban on the sale of assault-style rifles. The NRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. LEAST LIKELY TO VOTE At last month's rallies, nearly 5,000 people signed up to vote in the November elections, according to HeadCount, a non-partisan group that registers young people to vote at concerts. But young people, especially teenagers, have traditionally been the demographic group least likely to vote. Only 46.1 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds voted in the 2016 general election, the lowest participation rate of any age group, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Organizers of the campaign, however, have been buoyed by anecdotal signs that the Parkland shooting spurred teenage voter activism. In California, new voter pre-registration among 16- and 17-year-olds surged between March 14 and April 2, according to a state official, and a new Harvard poll among 18- to 29-year-olds found a marked increase in the number who said they would  ""definitely be voting"" this autumn.

March for Our Lives Highlights: Students Protesting Guns Say ‘Enough Is Enough’' Hundreds of thousands of protesters, outraged by a recent school shooting, took to the streets in Washington and around the world, calling for action against gun violence. March for Our Lives: Maps of the More Than 800 Protests Around the World Just over a month after the Parkland mass school shooting, organizers have planned hundreds of demonstrations calling for stricter gun laws. In Gun Control Marches, Students Led but Adults Provided Key Resources The March for Our Lives demonstrations were triumphs of organic, youthful grass-roots energy, and of sophisticated, experienced organizational muscle. ‘Something About Parkland Has Been Different’: Survivors From 20 Years of Mass Shootings Speak We spoke to survivors of mass shootings and others affected by them about the demonstrations planned for Saturday, March 24. 20 Years After the Shooting on the Playground The writer of this Opinion essay, a survivor of the 1998 attack at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Ark., in which four students and a teacher were fatally shot, says, “It was jarring to find a group of survivors — my former classmates — as divided as our country.” Advertisers Drop Laura Ingraham After She Taunts Parkland Survivor David Hogg Ms. Ingraham had apologized for mocking Mr. Hogg over his college rejections. “She only apologized after we went after her advertisers,” he said. “It kind of speaks for itself.” Support for Gun Control Seems Strong. But It May Be Softer Than It Looks The new activists are hoping the old patterns of weak support will change.  What the Dreamers Can Teach the Parkland Kids “From one activist to another: Trust your instincts, study your history and don’t read the comments,” says this Opinion essay writer. Thank a Teenager This Opinion writer states, “At times yesterday, the protesting students seemed to be everywhere — on social media, on television, in communities. And they offered a needed jolt of inspiration in a dark political time.” National School Walkout: Thousands Protest Against Gun Violence Across the U.S. In a coordinated action, students left their classrooms and sometimes marched in the streets a month after 17 people were killed in a Florida high school. We Stand With the Students “The nation’s adults must listen to the students walking out of their schools Wednesday to protest gun violence,” states this editorial. Letting Teenagers Live This Opinion essay writer says, “Motor vehicle crashes kill more young people than shootings, and the issue is less affected by politics.” Mr. Trump, Here’s a Teenage Hero; It’s Your Turn! “A 15-year-old stood up to the Parkland gunman, yet the president won’t stand up to the N.R.A.,” states this Opinion essay. Parkland Students Find Themselves Targets of Lies and Personal Attacks David Hogg is not an actor. He was indeed at school that day. Emma González did not tear up a copy of the Constitution. Why I Didn’t Join My School’s Walkout The writer of this Opinion essay states, “I am a high school junior, and I shoot guns and hunt. Many of the kids protesting guns right now don’t seem to know that much about them.”  I Tried to Befriend Nikolas Cruz. He Still Killed My Friends “The notion that the Parkland shootings wouldn’t have occurred if students had been kinder is deeply dangerous,” writes a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who as an eighth grader had been assigned to tutor Mr. Cruz through the school’s peer counseling program. Brother of Nikolas Cruz Arrested on Trespassing Charge at Stoneman Douglas High School Sheriff’s deputies stopped Zachary Cruz on Monday afternoon after he rode a skateboard onto the school’s property, the authorities said. School officials had told him to stay away. After Parkland, Turning Trauma Into Change Students who survived the attacks at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School discuss the psychological aftermath. 7 Times in History When Students Turned to Activism The survivors of the Parkland, Fla., high school shooting have surprised many with their public activism. But they are hardly the first students to push the adult world for political change. Arming Teachers In as many as a dozen states, schools have already taken advantage of laws that allow employees to carry guns. Ohio is one of them. Who Should Be Armed in Florida Schools? Not Teachers, Lawmakers Say. But Maybe Librarians. After a debate on the State Senate floor on Monday, Republican legislative leaders backed off on arming most teachers, but voted to allow others in schools to carry guns. Why We Should Lower the Voting Age to 16 “Young people ought to have a say in how school shootings are best prevented,” states this Opinion essay writer. Power to the Parents “Give kids the franchise — but let their parents exercise it,” says the writer of this Opinion essay.  School Officer: A Job With Many Roles and One Big Responsibility School resource officers like the one under scrutiny following the Florida shooting are expected to act as counselors and instructors as well as the first line of defense. Dear National Rifle Association: We Won’t Let You Win. From, Teenagers. “Our parents did not succeed in ensuring our safety at school. So we must do it ourselves,” write the New Jersey high school students who penned this Opinion essay.

None,275," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 20, 2018, 6:41 P.M. E.D.T. Once again, they filed out of class. In a new wave of school walkouts, they raised their voices against gun violence. But this time, they were looking to turn outrage into action. Many of the students who joined demonstrations across the country Friday turned their attention to upcoming elections as they pressed for tougher gun laws and politicians who will enact them. Scores of rallies turned into voter registration drives. Students took the stage to issue an ultimatum to their lawmakers. ""We want to show that we're not scared. We want to stop mass shootings and we want gun control,"" said Binayak Pandey, 16, who rallied with dozens of students outside Georgia's Capitol in Atlanta. ""The people who can give us that will stay in office, and the people who can't give us that will be out of office."" All told, tens of thousands of students left class Friday for protests that spread from coast to coast. They filed out at 10 a.m. to gather for a moment of silence honoring the victims of gun violence. Some headed to nearby rallies. Others stayed at school to discuss gun control and register their peers to vote.  Organizers said an estimated 150,000 students protested Friday at more than 2,700 walkouts, including at least one in each state, as they sought to sustain a wave of youth activism that drove a larger round of walkouts on March 14. Activists behind that earlier protest estimated it drew nearly 1 million students.  HeadCount, a nonprofit group that registers voters at music events, said 700 people had signed up to vote through its website during the past week. That's up from just 10 people in the same period last year. Spokesman Aaron Ghitelman credited the uptick to walkout organizers who steered teens to the group's website. Friday's action was planned by a Connecticut teenager, Lane Murdock, after a gunman stormed Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14, leaving 17 people dead. It was meant to coincide with the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting in Littleton, Colorado. The focus on the November elections reflects a shift after activists gained little immediate traction in Washington — and prospects for their influence remain uncertain. Congress has shown little inclination to tighten gun laws, and President Donald Trump backed away from his initial support for raising the minimum age to buy some guns. Among those who helped orchestrate the walkout — and the voter registration push — was the progressive group Indivisible, which formed after the 2016 election to oppose Trump's policies. In cities across the country, it was common to see crowds of students clad in orange — the color used by hunters to signal ""don't shoot"" — rallying outside their schools or at public parks. Several hundred gathered at New York City's Washington Square Park, chanting ""The NRA has got to go!"" and ""Enough is enough."" A large group in Washington marched from the White House to the Capitol building to rally for gun control. Nate Fenerty was among dozens of students who left class to rally in Richmond, Virginia. He registered to vote for the first time at tables set up by students at the protest and said he wants Congress to approve mandatory background checks for gun buyers.  ""How many more times are we going to stand in memoriam for another school shooting before our policymakers to actually do something?"" said Fenerty, who carried a sign saying ""Am I Next?""      Virginia students had expected 10,000 people at the Richmond rally, but only about 300 showed up. Still, those who turned up said they weren't discouraged. Shortly before the walkouts, news spread that there had been another shooting at a Florida school. Authorities say one student shot another in the ankle at Forest High School in Ocala early Friday. A suspect was taken into custody. Activists said it underscored the urgency of their work. Student David Hogg, a Parkland survivor who has emerged as a leading activist, took to social media nearly every day this week urging students to register. On Thursday he made the motivation clear on Twitter: ""The only way to make politicians listen to us is by voting in ones that will,"" he said. Hogg was among about 50 students who walked out of Stoneman Douglas on Friday after administrators threatened protesters with unexcused absences. Craig Smith and Terry McGary, both 17-year-old juniors, said they walked out because they want to show respect for the Columbine victims. ""It was a guilt trip to make us not walk out,"" McGary said about the threat. The walkouts drew counter-protesters in some areas, including about 30 at a rally outside New Hampshire's statehouse. In Kansas, about 200 gun-rights supporters held their own demonstration outside the statehouse. Many carried signs and flags, and some brought holstered handguns. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Republican candidate for governor, addressed the crowd and later criticized the walkout movement. ""Instead of walking out of class, why don't you stay in class and spend that half hour studying the Second Amendment? You might learn something,"" Kobach said later.  Some students in Colorado participated in the walkouts but not at Columbine, which has closed on April 20 ever since the 1999 shooting that left 15 people dead. Some Columbine students attended a vigil with Parkland survivors on Thursday night, but on Friday, their school called on them to attend a day of service. Principal Scott Christy said in a letter to other schools in his district that April ""has long been a time to respectfully remember our loss, and also support efforts to make our communities a better place."" __ Binkley can be reached on Twitter at @cbinkley ___ Binkley reported from Boston.

None,276," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 19, 2018, 4:04 P.M. E.D.T. MONTPELIER, Vt. —  A judge is now open to considering a request to dismiss charges — including attempted aggravated murder — against a Vermont teen accused of planning to shoot up his former high school. The judge said Wednesday he was vacating his earlier dismissal of the defense's request to throw out the charges against 18-year-old Jack Sawyer. The move comes after the Vermont Supreme Court ruled last week that Sawyer should not be held without bail, saying planning a crime does not amount to an attempted crime. Rutland County Superior Court Judge Thomas Zonay is calling for a hearing on the dismissal request. The state has until Monday to file any opposition to the motion. Sawyer was arrested Feb. 15, a day after the Parkland, Florida, shooting that killed 17, after a friend reported him to authorities. Prosecutors say Sawyer, who kept a diary called ""The Journal of an Active Shooter,"" made detailed plans for a shooting at Fair Haven Union High School and said his goal was to kill more people than in any other school shooting.  His lawyer, Kelly Green, said in the dismissal motion filed Thursday that Sawyer ""is charged with four crimes, an essential element of each crime being that Jack attempted the crimes.      ""Moreover, the Vermont Supreme Court has reviewed the evidence in this case ... and determined that Jack's acts do not constitute an attempt,"" she said. Rutland County State's attorney Rose Kennedy did not return an email seeking comment. Sawyer has pleaded not guilty and was held without bail until the Vermont Supreme Court ruling led Zonay to set bail at $100,000 on Tuesday. Sawyer was still being held in jail on Thursday.  Among conditions for release are that he be under the supervision of his father and a 24-hour curfew at his home as well as not have any contact with students, staff or teachers at the school.

None,277," By REUTERSAPRIL 19, 2018, 9:52 P.M. E.D.T. NEW YORK —  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Thursday ramped up pressure on banks and insurers to revisit whether their ties to the National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups harm their reputations and the public interest. Cuomo, a Democrat, noted that some well-known companies, including the insurer MetLife Inc, have ended some business relationships with the NRA after a gunman killed 17 people at a Parkland, Florida, high school on Valentine's Day. The governor directed New York's Department of Financial Services to urge state-chartered banks and the more than 1,400 insurers it regulates to review whether their ties to the NRA and similar groups sends the ""wrong message"" to clients and communities. ""This is not just a matter of reputation, it is a matter of public safety,"" Cuomo said in a statement.  The financial services superintendent, Maria Vullo, told banks and insurers in separate letters that ""prompt actions"" may be needed to manage reputational risks and promote public safety, at a time society ""is no longer willing to stand by and wait and witness more tragedies caused by gun violence.""  William Brewer, a lawyer for the NRA, in a statement accused Cuomo and Vullo of abusing the public's trust by ""mounting a blacklisting campaign that seeks to deprive Second Amendment advocates of banking services and insurance coverage in the State of New York.""      In February, MetLife ended a program for NRA members to obtain insurance discounts for boats, motorcycles and recreational vehicles, while Chubb Ltd decided to stop underwriting an NRA-branded insurance program for gun owners. Some companies in other sectors have also shed NRA ties. Cuomo is running for a third term as governor. In a recent Siena College poll, he held a 58 percent to 27 percent lead among registered Democrats over the activist and actress Cynthia Nixon, who is trying to appeal to more liberal voters. The poll surveyed 692 registered voters, and had a margin of error of 4.3 percentage points.

Washington,279," Supported by By Maggie Haberman President Trump is planning to move ahead with his contentious proposal to provide firearms training to school employees and intends to establish a federal commission to examine other proposals, like his suggestion to raise the age to purchase some weapons, White House officials said on Sunday night. But the administration’s efforts appeared to be piecemeal and of limited scope, falling far short of the language Mr. Trump has used for weeks about the need to end the scourge of school shootings, including at a dramatic meeting with relatives of victims of the Parkland, Fla., massacre. In a call with reporters, the White House laid out a series of proposals that it said Mr. Trump intended to pursue to increase school safety. The White House said it wanted to partner with local officials to provide “rigorous firearms training” to school personnel, including teachers and other volunteers who want such training. Mr. Trump first proposed the idea shortly after a gunman killed 17 people in Parkland last month. Beyond saying that the Justice Department would work with local officials to provide firearms training, the White House offered few specifics. The proposals did not include Mr. Trump’s repeated call to raise the age for buying certain firearms from 18 to 21, an idea that has been opposed by the National Rifle Association. White House officials said that the new Federal Commission on School Safety would study the notion of raising the age over the next year. The commission will be led by the education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Mr. Trump has denounced the type of commission that he is appointing to study the issue. At a rally on Saturday night in Pennsylvania, he said that such panels were the sort of empty solution that Washington often relies on instead of actually fixing problems. The plans described by the officials are set to be unveiled formally on Monday. The administration intends to press states to focus on options like so-called extreme risk protection orders to curtail access to firearms for people with mental health problems. The president will also push for Congress to pass a bill, sponsored by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, to improve reporting to the national background check system — a modest step backed by the N.R.A. Mr. Trump has sowed confusion over where he stands on gun control measures. He has voiced sympathy for those who want to see tighter age restrictions for gun purchases and even more comprehensive measures, but at other times, he has sounded more sympathetic to the N.R.A., which was a major contributor to his 2016 campaign.

Metro,280," By JESSE McKINLEYMARCH 6, 2018 ALBANY — If the dueling legislation passed this week is any indication, it seems that little of significance is likely to happen with gun control anytime soon in Albany. Collectively, the State Senate and Assembly passed 20 bills within a 24-hour period Monday and Tuesday, touching on everything from placing armed guards in schools across the state to banning the possession of bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic rifles to fire almost as fast as machine guns. But the approach of each chamber’s legislation left little hope for common ground, with the Republican-led Senate emphasizing security and school safety, and the Democrat-dominated Assembly pushing to strengthen background checks, seize guns from dangerous individuals and prevent domestic abusers from obtaining weapons. The Senate, in fact, had already declined to take up similar bills supported by Democrats in their chamber last week. And on Tuesday, the speaker of the Assembly, Carl E. Heastie of the Bronx, suggested that he and his fellow Democrats had profound philosophical differences with the G.O.P.’s reaction to a recent massacre at a high school in Parkland, Fla., which left 17 people — including students as young as 14 — dead. “We don’t think that more guns on top of students is the answer,” said Mr. Heastie. “There should be less guns.”  While Mr. Heastie indicated support for the idea of more school security, he offered little for any for the 15 bills that passed Monday in the Senate, including a proposal to create a program for “school resource officers” — either a retired or active-duty police officer, sheriff deputy or state trooper, who would be authorized to carry a firearm in schools across New York. Another bill would require a police officer to be present at any school in New York City, public or private, “during instructional hours and at least one hour prior and one hour after such instructional hours.”  The passage of the city schools bill, by a wide margin, also had political significance: Its sponsor is Senator Simcha Felder, the renegade Democrat from Brooklyn who conferences with Republicans to help them rule the Senate. Mr. Felder has been pressured to rejoin the Democrats, but has said that his decision to do so could come down to which party supports his efforts to get armed police officers in schools. And on Monday, Republicans did just that, by putting the bill up for a vote. The Republican package also included a bill that would create a “distinctive” $25 license plate, emblazoned with the words of “Guardians for Schools” over an image of a police officer with two children or a law enforcement badge. The money raised from the plate would used to beef up security in public schools. The bill, sponsored by Senator James Tedisco, a Republican, caused a ruckus on the Senate floor on Monday after a Democratic opponent, Senator Brad Hoylman of Manhattan, derided the idea as “so harebrained” and voted against it.      Mr. Tedisco rose immediately, calling Mr. Hoylman and other Democrats hypocrites for benefiting from security at the Capitol but not wanting the same for their constituents. “You have metal detectors,” Mr. Tedisco said, raising his voice and staring at Mr. Hoylman. “Why shouldn’t we raise money for them to have metal detectors so weapons can’t get in the school?” Mr. Hoylman later called the Republicans’ measures “an empty gesture,” and said that he would soon introduce a proposal to ban the possession of rifles and long guns for any person without a hunting license under the age of 21. “After Parkland, there’s a growing realization that kids shouldn’t own firearms,” he said. “The shooter in Parkland was 19.” Indeed, the legislation-at-loggerheads comes less than three weeks after the school shooting in Florida, an event repeatedly invoked on the Assembly floor on Tuesday. “I am done battening down the hatches every time these massacres occur until we move on to other subjects,” said James Skoufis, an Democratic Assemblyman representing parts of Rockland County and Orange County, adding, “People are dying, children are dying, and it’s happening over and over and over again.” The question of how much action will be taken may well depend on Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who has praised his own efforts to battle gun violence, including the 2013 SAFE Act, which outlawed the sale of so-called assault rifles, like the one used in Parkland. Mr. Cuomo has offered mild support for some proposals from fellow Democrats, but has preferred to rail against lack of action by Republicans in Washington. “We support further strengthening the strongest gun safety laws in the country, and look forward to discussing proposals to do that with the Assembly and Senate,” Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, said on Tuesday. “But as the governor said, to most effectively curb gun violence we need federal action, and the lack of federal action on this is alarming.” A version of this article appears in print on March 7, 2018, on Page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: Flurry of Gun Control Bills in Albany, but Little Common Ground.

None,281," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 20, 2018, 11:07 P.M. E.D.T. FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. —  A gunman carrying a shotgun in a guitar case opened fire at a Florida high school, wounding one student as other students and teachers piled desks and cabinets against classroom doors to make barricades. The 19-year-old suspect was later arrested and apologized as he was led away in handcuffs. Friday's shooting at Forest High School in Ocala happened on a day planned for a national classroom walkout to protest gun violence. A 17-year-old boy was taken to a hospital for treatment of a non-life threatening wound to his ankle. The suspect, Sky Bouche said ""sorry,"" followed by ""It doesn't matter anyway"" to reporters as he was led from the school in handcuffs by several deputies. Authorities said Bouche was a former student at the school. ""I didn't shoot anyone,"" he said to reporters. He ignored most of the other questions until asked what he'd say to the shooting victim. That's when he said, ""sorry.""  The shooting comes just over two months after a gunman killed 17 people and wounded 17 others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Nikolas Cruz, 19, faces the death penalty if convicted in that Valentine's Day shooting.  It also coincided with a nationwide student walkout to protest gun violence on the anniversary of the 1999 massacre at Colorado's Columbine High School. The Ocala school had planned its version of a walkout, students said. Chris Oliver told the Ocala Star-Banner his 16-year-old son, a Forest student, told him the shooting happened near his classroom. The boy told Oliver the shooter stood in a hallway and fired at a closed classroom door. The shooter then dropped the weapon, ran and tried to hide, the boy told his father. Craig Ham, deputy superintendent of Ocala schools operations, said the gunman carried the shotgun in a guitar case into the school by blending in with students. Ham told reporters the shooter fired at the bottom of a locked classroom door, and pellets struck the victim in the ankle. Jake Mailhiot's psychology class had just begun Friday morning when school officials announced a ""code red"" alert over the intercom. ""You could hear in their voice that this wasn't a drill,"" the 16-year-old junior said. Prepared for such alerts, students and teachers leapt into action to barricade the classroom's one door and block the door's window. ""Our teachers started pushing file cabinets and desks toward the door, and a few friends and I joined in,"" Mailhiot said. ""We also started tying together some jackets to hang out the window, in case we needed another way out.""      In a photograph Mailhiot shared on social media, the classroom door is invisible behind a tall pile of furniture. Mailhiot said about 15 people in the classroom waited over 30 minutes to be evacuated by Ocala police. They were instructed to leave with their hands up, he said.  Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods praised the quick response by the school resource officer, as well as school personnel and first responders. In the Parkland shooting, school resource officer Scot Peterson retired amid accusations he didn't do enough to confront the Stoneman Douglas gunman. The Forest resource officer, Marion County Sheriff's Deputy James Long, ""did not hesitate. He went right in,"" Woods said at a news conference. Woods said Long heard a ""large, loud banging sound"" and immediately responded. The sheriff said the Bouche wasn't injured, wasn't fired at and was arrested without resistance. ""Marion County does everything to protect their children,"" Woods said. Afterward, all students were taken by bus with a police escort to First Baptist Church of Ocala, where parents gathered to pick them up, officials said. Rachael Carter was at the church waiting to be reunited with her daughter, a 10th-grader who turned 16 this week. Carter's pastor called her when he saw a post on social media. ""I'm shaking like a leaf in a hurricane,"" Carter said.

Business,282," By TIFFANY HSUMARCH 4, 2018 The best way to shield a school from a gunman is to have a metal detector. Or doors that can be remotely locked. Or Twitter-trawling bots looking for threats. Or bulletproof clipboards, whiteboards and backpacks. So says the fast-growing group of companies that sell school safety equipment. They have ramped up their marketing to school safety officials in the wake of the shooting last month at a high school in Parkland, Fla. But even as school districts rethink their security and seek to increase their budgets, they have little guidance from government agencies or independent consumer groups on which equipment would actually protect their students. Lawrence Leon, the chief of school police at the Palm Beach County school district in Florida, said he had received thousands of emailed pitches since the Parkland shooting. He said, “I’ve seen everything from door locks to apps to analytics to metal detectors, and I haven’t even gone through all of them yet.” Schools were generally considered a safe haven from the outside world until 1999, when two students at Columbine High School in Colorado massacred a dozen students and a teacher. In late 2012, a gunman killed 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Since then, more than 400 people have been shot in schools nationwide.  Campus security has become a growth market. Last year, sales of security equipment and services to the education sector reached $2.7 billion, up from $2.5 billion in 2015, according to data from IHS Markit. After the Parkland shooting, demand is surging.  “Right now, there’s going to be a lot of appropriations dollars being sent to school districts without a lot of oversight,” said Curtis S. Lavarello, executive director of the School Safety Advocacy Council, a training provider. “There are no national standards in terms of products for school safety.” Each July, the group holds a conference and expo about school safety that normally draws about 80 exhibitors and 700 guests. This year, after Parkland, registration is on track to exceed 120 companies and 1,000 visitors. The annual school safety conference hosted by the National Association of School Resource Officers drew 622 participants in 2011, then 733 in 2014 and 923 last year. Security options are manifold: palm scanners, mobile barricades, heat detectors, walkie-talkies, trauma kits, active shooter resistance training and more. In the fall, Florida Christian School in Miami began selling $120 ballistic panels for students to put in their backpacks. At a gun show in Tampa, Fla., last weekend, administrators and parents swarmed a booth offering similar panels for nearly $200 each. 
            School safety products and technologies are proliferating, but their effectiveness is unclear. Here are some examples of the flood of services being pitched to campus administrators.         The civilian body armor market was valued at $72.2 million in 2016 and is expected to more than double by 2024, according to Grand View Research. Richard Soloway, the chief executive of Napco Security Technologies, which makes safety software systems, said in an investor call on Feb. 5 that campus safety was a “significant opportunity.” The vast and expanding array of security products can confuse school officials, said Stacie Dinse, the marketing director of Rauland, which has provided communications systems to schools for more than 75 years. “Twenty years ago, school safety and security needs revolved around student fights, vandalism, weather-related emergencies and health-related emergencies such as a student asthma attack,” she said. “Today, there is much more focus on solutions to address emergency response and violence in their schools.” New companies are being formed to take advantage of the growing demand, people in the industry said. Businesses that had offered visitor management services and gunshot recognition software to hospitals and stadiums are now focusing more on schools. Military and law enforcement consultants are adding principals and superintendents to their rosters.  But Heather L. Schwartz, who has studied safety technology for the RAND Corporation, said that research into what actually works is “really thin.” “There’s not a lot of evidence to help districts sort through the pile before investing in costly systems,” she said. “There’s a lot of hunger for some authoritative third-party source to go out and review these options.” Often, schools react reflexively after high-profile school shootings, snapping up technologies and services as a symbolic gesture, Mr. Lavarello said. “Right now, you feel sorry for these kids who have lost their lives, and you’re searching for something fast, anything,” he said. “The principal wants to tell the parents, ‘Look, I have metal detectors and armed guards.’” But products like a folding shield with straps called the Bodyguard Blanket and a remote-controlled pepper spray system are often far from infallible, Mr. Lavarello said. He said his team had recently conducted a safety assessment at a school near Denver that had spent $600,000 fitting every window on campus with bulletproof film. Administrators had not realized that the film would prevent students trapped inside from breaking the glass to escape in an emergency. Advocacy groups focused on school safety, many of them founded by relatives of shooting victims, increasingly try to offer guidance to school administrators in the form of checklists and updates on local programs. The National Institute of Justice, a government agency, administers a program to test the effectiveness of commercially available body armor.  Erroll G. Southers, a public policy professor and the director of the Safe Communities Institute at the University of Southern California, said that all schools should at a minimum have their campuses assessed for safety risks.      He even proposed that insurance companies reward schools that do safety assessments with a reduced premium. “Schools should be treated like critical infrastructure,” he said. Some campuses are starting to rely on outside help, taking donations from families, neighborhood businesses and local rotary clubs. One company pledged to donate proceeds from its bulletproof backpacks to Parkland victims and their families. Several bills seeking to fund school safety efforts are currently winding their way through Congress. Sandy Hook was rebuilt in 2016 using a $50 million gift from the state of Connecticut. It has bullet-resistant windows adjacent to classroom doors, reinforced interior walls and landscaping that serves as a barrier outside the building. Other schools have raised money by issuing bonds and, in the case of Terry Shaw, the superintendent of the school district in Healdton, Okla., running a marathon to earn sponsorships from businesses. Mr. Shaw’s district, in the heart of tornado country, initially spent more than $100,000 installing seven shelters in the elementary school to protect students from windstorms. Last year, two more shelters were added to the middle school, where they are meant to double as hide-outs if there is a shooting. The district website links to a video in which Mr. Shaw tests a shelter by sitting inside while its exterior is pummeled by semiautomatic gunfire and explosives. “We’re left making those critical decisions on how best to protect our students,” he said. “Each school district’s different, and there are so many issues you start getting into that it’s hard to have a single set of guidelines.” A few days after the shooting in Parkland, school officials one county over, in Miami-Dade, drew up a long wish list of campus security measures.  The school district, the fourth largest in the country, currently receives $9.5 million from Florida to keep its campuses safe. But now the superintendent, school board chairwoman, mayor and other leaders are asking for an additional $30 million for “qualified human resources, artificial intelligence and technology based strategies,” according to a letter sent to state lawmakers last month. Miami-Dade’s plan includes video surveillance networks, automatically locking doors, digital floor plans, broad mass communications systems and ballistics-resistant windows. The county also wants more school resources officers and mental health services. On Tuesday, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, spoke to reporters about the need to fund school safety programs. “We’ve got to invest in metal detectors, we’ve got to invest in bulletproof glass, we’ve got to invest in steel doors, we’ve got to invest in upgraded locks,” he said. “We’ve got to do everything we can to make sure that somebody that wants to harm any one of our students can never do it again.” Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.

None,283," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 20, 2018, 2:04 P.M. E.D.T. NEW YORK —  Six years after his death, Trayvon Martin's name is known throughout the country as a symbol of social injustice and a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement his killing helped forge. Yet Trayvon was initially identified by the authorities as a ""John Doe,"" something that his father, Tracy Martin, still finds unsettling. It took enormous pressure for the police to release Zimmerman's 911 calls from that evening, which captured George Zimmerman chasing after the hoodie-clad high-schooler, who was armed only with Skittles and an Arizona Iced Tea. It was six weeks before Zimmerman, who was ultimately acquitted, was arrested. That Trayvon, the 17-year-old who was shot and killed by Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida, on February 26, 2012, might easily have remained anonymous to the wider public is one of the indelible impressions left by the six-part documentary series ""Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story."" The first episode was to premiere Friday at the Tribeca Film Festival. ""The state really tried to sweep this whole scenario under the rug,"" Martin said in an interview. ""We had to go through hell and high water just to get an arrest. They weren't going to arrest the individual who killed our son. That's kind of been forgotten.""  ""Rest in Power,"" produced by Jay-Z and premiering in June on the Paramount Network, charts the long, hard-fought journey that began as a family's tragedy but grew into a nationwide protest movement on civil rights, gun violence and racial profiling. ""It took my son being shot down to stand up,"" says Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's mother, in the series.  ""It didn't start with Trayvon,"" Fulton said in a separate interview. ""It didn't end with Trayvon."" Based on Fulton and Martin's 2017 book ""Rest in Power: The Enduring Life of Trayvon Martin,"" the series is also a painful reflection for Trayvon's parents, who have remained politically active (Fulton campaigned in 2016 for Hillary Clinton) in an effort to honor their slain son's legacy. In the series, Martin broken heartedly recalls going to his son's room to smell his laundry, fresh with the scent of fabric softener. Reliving the trauma was a difficult, if familiar experience. ""We truly relive the story every day,"" said Martin. (He and Fulton divorced in 1999 but have stayed close.) ""But it was emotional seeing it at this magnitude, seeing it put together from the perspective of someone else's eyes. The satisfaction of seeing it put together so well from someone who's not a part of the immediate family, it did hit home."" ""There were a lot of things I had forgotten about,"" said Fulton. ""That was a really, really dark period in my life. It's a period of my life I don't want to relive. To lose a child is different kind of pain. It's a different kind of hurt."" As much as Trayvon's story is their story, too, the parents believe ""Rest in Power"" holds lessons for all.      ""It's a teaching tool. It's a direct path to being engaged in many social justice issues that are plaguing our society today,"" said Martin. ""We're looking for this to be very impactful. We feel that the documentary is diversified. Everyone can relate to this."" ""There's going to be times where the audience is going to tear up,"" said Fulton. ""There's going to be times when they smile at the screen and say, 'Yes!' And there's going to be times where they say, 'OK, I need to do more.'"" Since the incident, Zimmermann has tried to auction off the gun he shot Trayvon with, labeling it an ""American Firearm Icon."" In 2015, he was arrested for aggravated assault and domestic violence with a weapon after he allegedly threw a wine bottle at his girlfriend. He was acquitted in the shooting of Martin on the grounds of self-defense. The case brought new attention to Florida's ""stand-your-ground"" law, which was signed into law by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush with NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer by his side. Martin and Fulton have advocated for gun control reform, focusing primarily on keeping guns out of the hands of ""irresponsible"" people.  ""A lot of people are afraid to go at the NRA. But I have nothing else to lose. I'm a father of slain child,"" said Martin. ""With this new administration in office, it's been a setback. There's not been enough attention focused on the humanitarian aspect of it all. Recently, the focus has only shifted because of the Parkland incident. It had to take a Parkland incident for the country to say: Let's make a change."" Trayvon's parents, who have considered running for political office, have high hopes for ""Rest in Power."" But they also have one simple goal. ""I just want people to remember that his life mattered,"" said Fulton. ""I want people to remember he had a right to live. And I want people to know that Trayvon represents so many others."" ___  ",2018-04-20,0.0031972663,Friday
None,284," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 20, 2018, 11:01 A.M. E.D.T. SPRINGFIELD, Ill. —  In a story April 19 about an Illinois bill concerning school resource officers, The Associated Press misstated the name of a poverty advocacy group. It is the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, not the Sargent Shriver Center on Poverty Law. The AP also misspelled the name of one the center's employees. Her name is Michelle Mbekeani-Wiley, not Michelle Mbekani-Wiley. A corrected version of the story is below: Illinois plan: Replace armed school officers with therapists Some Illinois lawmakers want to give extra money to schools that replace armed security officers with unarmed social workers and behavior therapists By SARAH ZIMMERMAN Associated Press SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Some Illinois lawmakers want to give extra money to schools that replace armed security officers with unarmed social workers and behavior therapists, an approach to safety that's far different than a national push to add police or arm teachers following a mass shooting at a Florida high school. Rep. Emanuel ""Chris"" Welch, a Hillside Democrat, said he proposed the plan after hearing from advocates who argue that investing in mental health resources is the best way of treating the epidemic of violence.  His plan, which is backed by 16 other Democrats in the House, would allow schools to apply to an optional grant if they promise to reallocate funding for school-based law enforcement to mental health services, including social workers or other practices ""designed to promote school safety and healthy environments.""  But the measure could be a tough sell, especially amid a widespread effort to employ more of what's known as school resource officers — fully armed law enforcement officers often paid for by schools. As of early April, 200 bills or resolutions have been introduced in 39 states regarding school safety, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. More than half of these measures were introduced following the shooting massacre in Parkland, Florida. Thirty-four bills in 19 states address regulations and training for school resource officers. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions proposed a school safety plan in March that included a measure prioritizing grants to states that agree to use the money to put more law enforcement in schools. Michelle Mbekeani-Wiley, from the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, said this approach is wrongheaded and that police are unequipped to recognize or respond to mental health issues. She adds that many minority students within the Chicago Public School system are arrested by school resource officers for non-serious offenses, which could jeopardize their chances of applying to jobs and colleges in the future.      ""This increased presence of law enforcement in schools does not necessarily enhance school safety,"" said Mbekeani-Wiley. ""Instead it dramatically increases the likelihood that students will be unnecessarily swept into the criminal justice system often for mere adolescent or disruptive behavior."" However, advocates for school resource officers argue their role is essential to keep students safe, especially in the event of a school shooting. After Parkland, Deputy Kip Heinle, former president of the Illinois School Resource Officers Association, said he was ""fielding two to three phone calls a day"" from school districts asking how they can add more patrolling officers. While there's no official count on how many school resource officers are employed in Illinois, he puts the estimate at around 500. Heinle, who works as a school resource officer in an Illinois suburb of St. Louis, says he believes that the officers are ""the best line of defense to keep students safe in school.""  He adds that, beyond preserving law and order in schools, many officers act like mentors and informal counselors to many of their students, with the goal of ""shaping them to be successful adults someday."" School resource officers are not required to be trained in Illinois, but they can pay to take part in an optional annual training session each summer in Bloomington. Around 85 to 100 officers from around the state typically attend, said Heinle. No Chicago Public School officers have ever attended, he added. __ The bill is HB4208 __  ",2018-04-19,0.0031913063,Thursday
Opinion,285," Supported by Compiled by Kathleen O’Brien Here is a selection of some notable recent pieces, including several on the debate over gun laws in the wake of a mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Our children have finally begun to turn the tide against guns in this country. They will grow up, and remember everything, and forgive nothing, writes Tim Kreider.  After the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the Editorial Board wrote: “Candidates must realize that reducing gun violence is a winning and moral issue. Aggressive turnout by voters who believe this can defeat the N.R.A. at the polls.” I am a junior in high school, and I regularly shoot guns, for target practice and hunting. Going to school can be hard because most kids don’t understand how I live. While much of the nation is loudly debating the prospect of arming teachers in the wake of the Parkland massacre, the decision has already been made in much of Ohio. We have a serious problem, and it goes far beyond “fake news.” Too many Americans have no idea how to properly read a social media feed. Here are some guidelines for being a smarter person online. Today the word “hyperactive” doesn’t just describe certain individuals; it also is a quality of our society.  And recent research suggests that some people with A.D.H.D. may be naturally suited to our turbocharged world.  Ralph Richard Banks, a law professor at Stanford, noted in an Op-Ed that a recent study “provides an empirical basis for an economic susceptibility that black parents like me have sensed: Across generations, we are less likely than whites to rise and when we do, are more likely later to fall.” He writes about finding the will to disrupt the cycle of black disadvantage. Here’s an idea: Social media tools and tech gadgets should not hurt us.  The Mark Zuckerbergs of the world need to start considering the ethical implications of the products they unleash. The latest installment of the Stone series looks at how to think about our data-driven world. The Russians seem to have a hold on the American president. If Trump isn’t Putin’s lackey, it’s past time for him to prove it, writes the Editorial Board. The invasion of Iraq began 15 years ago. Once brutalized by dictatorship under Saddam Hussein, the country became even more dysfunctional, difficult and dangerous for its people afterward. Read this searing account by Sinan Antoon, a poet and novelist born and raised there. ""I was an outsider in a place that is supposed to value weirdness."" Writer Joshunda Sanders recalls what it was like to be black in Austin, a city that holds racial truths at arm’s length. Remember Rob Ford, the deceased former mayor of Toronto? It didn’t matter to his base that he smoked crack cocaine while in office. Now his older brother Doug has a strong chance of becoming the premier of Ontario, and his rise is crushing the smugness Canadians have been feeling about Justin Trudeau.

None,287," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 17, 2018, 6:10 P.M. E.D.T. HELENA, Mont. —  Pearl Jam will look to tap into a national youth movement to register new voters when the pioneering grunge rock band plays a concert in tiny Missoula, Montana, one of just four cities in its U.S. tour this summer. The politically active band has dubbed the sold-out Aug. 13 concert ""Rock2Vote"" and plans to give a portion of its proceeds to four Montana organizations that support youth and Native American voting, land conservation and women's health. Bassist Jeff Ament, a native of Montana who lives part time in Missoula, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he's been inspired by the eloquence and passion of the teenage survivors of the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida. ""It's hard not to be inspired by the youth movement right now on a national level,"" Ament said. ""We'll certainly follow their lead.""  The band also plans to launch a Rock2Vote website to tell Montana fans about upcoming elections and what's happening in their communities, he said.  The aim is to encourage people who are coming of voting age to have a conversation about the divisive political climate and how it's affecting them, Ament said. ""Maybe it will be a model that can be used beyond Montana, but we're creating it for this show,"" Ament said. The Missoula concert will mark the third time Pearl Jam has played in Montana when Ament's childhood friend, U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, is up for election. The band also played in Missoula in support of Tester campaigns in 2005 and 2012.      The Montana Democrat is running for a third term in November, with four candidates competing for the Republican nomination to unseat him. Pearl Jam is coming back this time to support the Montana Democrat indirectly, Ament said. The band's financial contributions will go to its four ""partner"" organizations: Forward Montana, Montana Native Vote, Montana Conservation Voters and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana. Ament and Tester grew up in the northern Montana town of Big Sandy. Tester refereed Ament's childhood basketball games and they worked on adjacent farms during the summer. They even got the same crewcut from Ament's dad, George, who was the town's mayor and barber. Pearl Jam also will play two shows each in Seattle, Chicago and Boston starting in August. The short U.S. tour will follow a 13-stop European tour in June and July. Ament, who turned 55 last month, also is releasing a solo album and said that Pearl Jam does not have any immediate plans to go back into the studio. But after 28 years together, the band doesn't plan to slow down its heavy touring schedule. ""There's really nothing better than getting together with our friends and playing music,"" Ament said. ""It wouldn't really make sense to stop.""  ",2018-04-17,0.0031022425,Tuesday
National,288," By MATTHEW HAAGMARCH 26, 2018 A Maryland high school student who fatally shot his ex-girlfriend and injured another student outside a classroom last week killed himself when a school resource officer stationed on campus confronted him, the authorities said on Monday evening. The shooting at Great Mills High School in Southern Maryland last Tuesday was over in about a minute. Just before the first class period started, Austin Wyatt Rollins pulled out his father’s handgun in a hallway and fired one shot. It struck his former girlfriend, Jaelynn Willey, in the head and the other student, Desmond Barnes, in the leg. Moments later, Mr. Rollins, 17, was dead in another part of the school. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     But before Monday, it was not clear whether the gunman had killed himself or whether the resource officer, Deputy Blaine Gaskill, fatally shot him. The St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Office said its investigation had found that Mr. Rollins fired one shot at Jaelynn, 16, and then one more into his head at the same time Deputy Gaskill fired his weapon. Deputy Gaskill’s shot missed Mr. Rollins but struck his handgun, the sheriff’s office said. In its initial report after the shooting, the sheriff’s office said Deputy Gaskill and Mr. Rollins had exchanged gunfire. Amid the national debate over gun control and school shootings, Deputy Gaskill was heralded for his swift response and hailed as an example of how officers on campus can quickly end shootings. In the wake of the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla., politicians including President Trump have called for arming teachers and placing additional officers on campuses. Some have criticized those ideas. After the Maryland shooting, Jaelynn was taken to University of Maryland Prince George’s Hospital Center. Her parents said she was taken off life support on Thursday after she had been declared brain dead.  ",2018-03-27,0.0030598284,Tuesday
None,289," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 12, 2018, 5:31 P.M. E.D.T. LANSING, Mich. —  Before her brother took his own life, Mary Miller-Strobel said she and her father begged every store in town that sold firearms to turn him away. ""'If he comes, call me,'"" Miller-Strobel said her dad pleaded while waving her brother's picture at store managers in Charlotte, Michigan, in 2006. ""'Just call me. I will come.'"" She said the responses were the same: ""'Second amendment, sorry.'"" Two months later, her brother, Ben, shot himself with a revolver. Today, Miller-Strobel is 36 and a social worker in Wayne County. She said she still doesn't understand why her 26-year-old brother shot himself with a gun he legally owned.  She joined Michigan's chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America this year and became a champion for ""red flag"" legislation in Michigan, which would allow a resident's weapons to be taken if they are a danger to themselves or others.  ""We were trying so hard and nobody wanted to help us,"" Miller-Strobel said. ""If legislation like that were available, that would have been the golden ticket."" Interest in red flag laws has surged since a February school shooting in Parkland, Florida, left 17 people dead. Documents show that months before the massacre, school officials and police were so concerned about the mental stability of the suspect, Nikolas Cruz, that they wanted him forcibly committed. That never happened. But statistically, the gun tragedy most likely to touch Americans is suicide. Nearly 60 percent of the 38,658 gun deaths in the U.S. in 2016 were people taking their own lives, compared to 37 percent homicides, 1.3 percent law enforcement encounters and about 1.2 accidental, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded . While tragic, mass shootings accounted for less than 500 deaths in 2016 and 2017, according to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive. Research suggests the nation's first red-flag law — passed by Connecticut in 1999 after a disgruntled employee killed four executives inside the state's lottery headquarters — has become an important tool to prevent suicides. About two-thirds of the weapons seizures there were out of suicide concern, according to a 2017 study. It estimated that Connecticut's policy stopped one suicide per 10 to 20 gun seizures over 14 years. ""If finding that risky person is like finding a needle in a haystack, this gives us a much smaller haystack with a lot more needles,"" said Duke University professor Jeffrey Swanson, who led the study. Rep. Robert Wittenberg, sponsor of the red-flag proposal introduced in Michigan last June, said preventing firearm suicide could be the bills' chief outcome. ""This could save lives, and that's why we're pushing it,"" the Democrat said. However, National Rifle Association member Jerold Garland walked away from his 14-year-old son's suicide in 2016 with a very different conclusion.      The night Garland's son killed himself, the boy set his coiled headphones on his bed, right beside his glasses. The gun he used was taken from the family safe. Police found the chilling note, ""I have everybody fooled,"" inside a notebook.  Two months later, Garland returned to teaching his concealed pistol license class. ""I knew I had to teach that class,"" the 47-year-old resident of Romulus, Michigan, said. ""That was the hardest thing for me, because that's what brought it back."" Red-flag measures would not have applied to his son because the gun belonged to Garland. However, he said his son is proof that gun control does not thwart people already wanting to die. ""As a father who gave my son the knowledge and the ability, I have a hard time blaming the gun,"" he said. The red-flag bills in Michigan would ban someone from purchasing or possessing a firearm for up to a year, provided a court deems the individual at risk of self-injury or harm to others. Law enforcement and loved ones as well as former partners, roommates or anyone with ""a close relationship"" may file a report. The proposal has stalled in the Republican-controlled Legislature despite support from GOP Gov. Rick Snyder. Five states — California, Connecticut, Indiana, Oregon and Washington — had red-flag laws at the time of the Parkland shooting. The National Conference of State Legislatures counts at least 16 other states reviewing similar provisions. Since Parkland, Florida and Vermont have passed such laws. A 2016 study on suicide attempts concludes that firearms increase risk of death by 140 times. In Michigan, 53 percent of suicide deaths were inflicted by gun, according to 2016 CDC data. Cathy Barber, who directs the Means Matter Campaign that educates the public about firearm suicide prevention, said one thing is certain: People who want to take their own life usually do not remain so. Only 2.3 percent of people who tried to kill themselves die from another attempt, according to the previous study from 2016. ""It's an intense state that can flare up and then recede, sometimes after a matter of just hours,"" Barber said. ""You don't get that opportunity when you've pulled the trigger."" Pat Gallinagh, 72, knows this firsthand. In 1966, Gallinagh was a second-team All-Big Ten defensive tackle for Michigan State University. Five years later, he climbed on a chair, slipped a noose over his neck and lifted one foot in the air. He stopped himself mid-leap. Today, he is a suicide prevention advocate in Ironwood, Michigan, and supports red-flag laws.  He credits his survival to the lack of firearms in his home with his uncle that day. ""If I had access (to guns), we wouldn't be talking right now,"" he said. ""I'm living, breathing proof that intervention works and there is a light.""  ",2018-04-12,0.0029814974,Thursday

Before the show's launch in January 2015, KDNL-TV touted it as a nontraditional newscast with a conservative spin. Allman's radio show on KFTK-FM has been taken off the air while the company ""looks into the matter,"" said Esther-Mireya Tejeda, a spokeswoman for Entercom, which began operating the station last month. Allman hasn't responded to messages from the Associated Press seeking comment. Several businesses pulled advertising from Allman's shows after he sent the March 26 tweet targeting David Hogg, who has strongly advocated for stricter gun control since 17 people were killed in the Feb. 14 mass shooting at his school in Parkland, Florida.  Allman's Twitter account was ""locked"" shortly after he sent the tweet, restricting access to his account, but a screenshot of it has been widely circulated on social media.  Hogg's willingness to take on the gun-control cause has made him a target for some conservatives. Fox News Channel's Laura Ingraham apologized via social media for her tweet that Hogg had ""whined"" about not getting in to some colleges. She returned Monday night after a weeklong vacation and denounced a ""Stalinist"" effort by liberals to stifle the free speech of conservatives. Ingraham hasn't discussed that episode specifically but promised upcoming stories about conservatives who she says are fighting attempts to silence them. Hogg, meanwhile, said it's ""time to love thy neighbor, not mudsling at children."" Their social media spat came to symbolize the debate over how youthful advocates for gun safety should be treated by political opponents. Another student, Emma Gonzalez, has been falsely depicted in a doctored photo tearing up the Constitution. In Missouri, state Rep. Stacey Newman, a Democrat from Richmond Heights, led calls for a boycott by Allman's sponsors after he sent his tweet.      ""We've had people all over Missouri (and) all over the country weighing in on this ... it's heartwarming to know that tons of people throughout the state understand this is not acceptable,"" Newman told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Monday. ""Even though we hadn't asked for his removal or resignation, (Sinclair) took it upon themselves. People know where the line is."" Sinclair is a conservative-leaning company that owns nearly 200 local TV stations, making it one of the largest such companies in the U.S. President Donald Trump last week defended the company after a video showing dozens of Sinclair news anchors reading a script expressing concern about ""fake stories"" and ""one-sided news stories plaguing the country"" appeared on TV news reports and circulated online. Trump said rival TV stations were merely ""worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast."" Sinclair also has pushed for regulation of the broadcast industry to be eased and is trying to buy Tribune Media in a move that would dramatically increase the company's reach. Allman also served a six-month stint in 2004 and 2005 as chief spokesman for then-St. Louis Archbishop Raymond Burke and executive director of communications for the archdiocese. Archdiocese spokesman Gabe Jones didn't immediately respond to a phone call and email message seeking comment. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Fox News Channel host Laura Ingraham was on vacation after criticizing a Parkland, Florida student, not on leave.

None,291," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 14, 2018, 7:37 P.M. E.D.T. DOVER, Del. —  Gun rights supporters — many carrying rifles and ammunition — gathered at state capitols across the U.S. on Saturday to push back against efforts to pass stricter gun-control laws that they fear threaten their constitutional right to bear arms. From Delaware to Wyoming, hundreds gathered at peaceful protests to listen to speakers who warned that any restrictions on gun ownership or use eventually could lead to a ban on gun ownership, which is guaranteed under the Second Amendment. ""If you have a building and you take a brick out every so often, after a while you're not going to have a building,"" said Westley Williams, who carried an AR-15 rifle as he joined about 100 people braving blustery weather in Cheyenne, Wyoming, for a pro-gun-rights rally in front of the state supreme court building. Dave Gulya, one of the organizers of a rally in Augusta, Maine, said about 800 people showed up at the statehouse — a gun-free zone — to make the point that ""we are law-abiding.""  Saturday's protests were planned in dozens of state capitols less than three weeks after hundreds of thousands marched in Washington, New York and elsewhere to demand tougher gun laws after the February school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17.  Organizers of those protests demanded a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and called for universal background checks on potential gun owners.  During a pro-gun-rights gathering in Atlanta on Saturday, more than a quarter of the estimated 160 rally-goers carried weapons, as well as flags and signs saying ""Don't Tread On Me"" as they listened to speakers talk about the right to bear arms. A few people wearing ""Black Lives Matter"" T-shirts showed up at the rally and made videos, but didn't interact with the rally-goers. Protesters also showed up in Boston; Indianapolis; Montpelier, Vermont; Albany, New York; Austin, Texas, Des Moines, Iowa; and other cities.      The coalition behind the gun rights rallies describes itself as a collection of patriotic-based groups that ""come from all walks of life, including Three Percent groups and local militias."" The Three Percent movement vows to resist any government that infringes on the U.S. Constitution. Its name refers to the belief that just 3 percent of colonists rose up to fight the British. Such groups lack the following of more mainstream Second Amendment advocates such as the National Rifle Association. A group called the National Constitutional Coalition of Patriotic Americans spread word of the rallies on social media. ___ This story has been edited to update crowd in Atlanta to about 160, instead of 180. ___ Associated Press writers Patrick Whittle in Portland, Maine; Michael Conroy in Indianapolis; Mead Gruver in Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Tammy Webber in Chicago contributed to this report.

Business,292," By TIFFANY HSUAPRIL 10, 2018 Bank of America will stop lending money to gun manufacturers that make military-inspired firearms for civilian use, such as the AR-15-style rifles that have been used in multiple mass shootings, a company executive said Tuesday. The policy is the latest example of Wall Street wading into the divisive gun control debate after Citigroup’s announcement last month that it would require business customers to restrict certain types of firearms sales. “We want to contribute in any way we can to reduce these mass shootings,” Anne M. Finucane, vice chairwoman at the Bank of America, said on Bloomberg TV. The bank works with “just a handful of manufacturers,” with whom it has had “intense conversations over the last few months,” Ms. Finucane said. Their reactions to the new policy have been “mixed,” she said.  Bank of America would not name any of the gun manufacturers it works with, but its clients include well-known, publicly held brands. The bank will wind down its relationships with the companies that choose to continue making AR-15-style rifles and similar guns.  There are few investor-owned gun makers in the United States. One of them, American Outdoor Brands Corporation, which owns the Smith & Wesson brand, has seen its stock shed half its value in the past year. Another, Sturm, Ruger & Company, has fared much better, dipping only slightly. Both companies make AR-15-style rifles.      For now, Bank of America will continue to offer banking services to firearms retailers. Asking gun shops to stop selling certain types of handguns or long guns “gets into civil liberties” and is “a ways off,” Ms. Finucane said. Corporations piled into the gun-control debate after a shooting at a school in Parkland, Fla., in February left 17 people dead and fueled a nationwide boycott effort against companies that had become partners with the powerful National Rifle Association trade group. Businesses including car rental companies, airlines, dating apps and Walmart scaled back their exposure to guns. Wall Street, with its many ties to the gun industry, was slower to act. BlackRock said it was asking major gun makers and sellers about their business practices. Bank of America did the same. In March, Citigroup was the first big bank to issue a new firearms policy, requiring clients in the gun industry to stop selling to customers who have not passed a background check or are younger than 21. Citigroup also bars clients who use its lending, banking or capital-raising services from selling bump stocks and high-capacity magazines. Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.

National,293," By JULIE TURKEWITZMARCH 15, 2018 Plans for the student walkouts on Wednesday, when tens of thousands of people left their classrooms to protest gun violence, had stirred controversy for weeks in Montana, where the gun ownership rate outranks that in nearly every other state. In Billings, the state’s most populous city, parents threatened to ground students who left their classrooms. And organizers of a walkout from Billings West High School changed a call for “gun reform” on their Facebook page to one for “school safety.” In the end, there were walkouts at three Billings high schools. At Billings West, administrators cleared the snow on the front lawn and hundreds of young people in a school of 1,800 came streaming out of their classrooms. Two Billings West students share why they walked out — or stayed in class. Jareth Brown, 18 Favorite Class: Sociology What he wants to be when he grows up: Actor, writer Why he stayed in class: Jareth grew up with guns, and hunting is “a sacred thing” in his family.  He had seen coverage of mass shootings at other schools, and he initially considered participating in the walkout, to protest “the evil that is almost stirring within our country.”  But as he watched the students organize over several weeks, he said, he realized that “some of the crowd would be walking out for the wrong reasons.” They wanted to skip class, he said. They wanted to “fraternize.” And some students were calling for an outright ban on firearms like the AR-15. Jareth is in favor of background checks. He said he was in favor of waiting periods for some weapons but not of a ban on the AR-15, since he thinks that would “infringe on the Second Amendment.” Jareth said that he realized his fellow students want to stop gun violence, but that he didn’t think they had the right answers. He believed that his school needed to bring in another armed guard, and that it should allow teachers and students with proper licenses to bring firearms to school. When the walkout began on Wednesday at 10 a.m., he sat in his English class as more than half of his classmates left. “It was almost foolhardy,” he said of the walkout. “To me it was a demonstration of a lot of our students here trying to represent that they believe they can make a change — but a lot of them don’t know what that change is yet. To me they aren’t quite ready and they don’t know where to start.”      Ben Sholar, 17 Favorite Class: Environmental science What he wants to be when he grows up: Botanist Why he walked out: The shooting in Parkland, Fla., left Ben heartbroken. Another student approached him with the idea of the March 14 walkout. A Facebook page went up, calling for “gun reform.” Then the backlash began. Adults began harassing him on Facebook, he said. Students balled up protest fliers and threw them in his face. His group changed the protest’s focus, he said, to “school safety.”  Ben was not sure how many people would show up, but he walked out anyway. “I own a gun; my dad has a shotgun that I can use,” he said. “But I just don’t understand why we need military-grade weapons in our arsenal.” Hundreds of students gathered for the protest, he said. They joined hands and read the names of the Parkland victims. “They don’t know what they’re talking about,” he said of his critics, who were mostly adults. “Times have changed since they were in high school. We’re a lot more politically active and involved in Montana than a lot of the people who grew up here.” Ben went on: “They don’t have to grow up every day with the possibility of a person coming in with a gun. That’s not on their mind. But it’s on every high school student’s mind.” Mitch Smith contributed reporting from Chicago.

National,294," By ALAN BLINDERAPRIL 11, 2018 HELENA, Mont. — It has been an iron rule for candidates in rural areas and red states for decades: Do not antagonize the National Rifle Association. But that was before the massacre at a high school in Parkland, Fla., galvanized gun politics across the country. Now, a striking number of Democratic candidates in coming midterm elections, from congressional contests in the Rocky Mountains to governor’s races in the Deep South, are openly daring, defying and disparaging the N.R.A., a group with deep pockets, a loyal membership and a record of Election Day score-settling. Those Democrats, but also a few Republicans, believe that in the wake of Parkland, many voters have been turned off by the N.R.A.’s hard line, its belligerence and its demands for lock-step loyalty from elected officials. Together, they are testing whether that iron rule for electoral survival and success across rural America still holds. “The N.R.A. has spent a lot of money on our congressman, and a lot of money on people in Washington, and that dictates what politicians are allowed to say or not say,” John Heenan, a Democrat running for Montana’s sole seat in the House of Representatives, said last week at the Mediterranean Grill restaurant in Helena, the snow-draped capital. “And I think all Montanans, especially gun owners, just want people who are going to be responsive to them and bring common sense to the table.”  Attacking the N.R.A., which claims a membership of nearly 5 million, in even a muted tone is a political gamble. Yet Democrats say they feel emboldened by the groundswell of outrage over gun violence after the Feb. 14 attack in Florida, which left 17 people dead. And they are encouraged by polls showing that measures like universal background checks and age restrictions for gun buyers are widely popular.  There is also a certain political expediency: Many of the Democrats airing misgivings about the N.R.A. and its views are now competing in primaries where they are playing to an audience of fellow Democrats and not yet the entire electorate. Their hostility to the N.R.A. in the spring could certainly fade by the fall, but in past election cycles, many candidates would have regarded openly crossing the N.R.A. as too risky even in primary races. “I don’t know that voters would have been more receptive; I think that candidates would have been more timid,” Stacey Abrams, a Democrat running for governor of Georgia, said last month before she addressed a March for Our Lives rally near the southern tip of the Appalachian Trail and promoted her history of poor ratings from the N.R.A. To be sure, some Democrats in conservative-leaning states, like Ms. Abrams, have long been willing to challenge the group, especially in urban areas — but there were rarely very many of them. Meanwhile, rural Democrats often did the opposite, and actively courted the N.R.A., whose seal of approval and potent ability to mobilize its members could lift a candidate of either party to victory. That era is not completely over. But many Democrats have grown wary of an organization that they believe has effectively evolved into an extension of the Republican Party, and they have begun to wonder whether they would be better off putting some distance between themselves and the N.R.A. The most fervent supporters of gun rights, some Democrats reason, are unlikely to support their campaigns no matter what they do. “I think those that are hypersensitive to this issue are likely not going to be voting for us anyway, and I understand that, because there are voters who believe that any discussion of the Second Amendment is the compromising of the Second Amendment,” said Walt Maddox, a Democratic candidate for governor of Alabama. “But I believe the vast majority of Democrats, independents and Republicans are not fearful of a discussion on this matter, especially if it’s reasonable, measured and common sense-oriented.” For his own part, Mr. Maddox declares allegiance to the Second Amendment, but he declined to fill out the questionnaire that the N.R.A. sends to candidates. In the N.R.A.’s view, refusing to complete the questionnaire is “often an indication of indifference, if not outright hostility, to gun owners’ and sportsmen’s rights.” Other Democrats have mounted far more pointed critiques of the group. The Democratic Party in Virginia, a state that retains a conservative streak despite recent Democratic successes, recently issued a statement referring to N.R.A. “blood money” and declaring that Virginians were excited about “kicking out politicians who value National Rifle Association money over the safety of their sons and daughters, mothers and fathers.”  And in Kentucky, a Democratic state representative from an overwhelmingly conservative district stood on the House floor in February to call for new gun control measures, and said he was surrendering his A rating from the N.R.A. Some Republicans have also calculated that they can now afford to cross the group to some extent. Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, who is running for the Senate this year, recently signed a Republican-backed gun-control package that was almost immediately challenged in a lawsuit by the N.R.A. The mass shooting in Parkland, which helped prompt the legislation Mr. Scott signed, appears to have been a political turning point even in places like Montana, which has one of the nation’s highest rates of gun ownership and where candidates often talk about their hunting credentials. At a candidates’ forum less than a week before the Parkland shooting, the Democrats vying for the party’s House nomination — there were then five — were asked whether they supported expanded background checks for gun purchasers. None said yes. Then came the rampage in Florida.      In short order, the race was infused with fresh calls to ban bump stocks, outlaw military-style weapons like the AR-15 and eliminate loopholes for sales at gun shows. Mr. Heenan, one of the candidates in the race, soon released an essay apologizing for not giving “a more straightforward answer” to a grandmother who had asked him how he would help prevent gun violence. Another candidate, Kathleen Williams, made prevention of gun massacres central to her platform, and later said, “If the N.R.A. wants to give me an F for that, then I will proudly stand with all of you and say that F means ‘fearless.’ ” 
                A full list of elections for the House and Senate, including which races matter most for congressional control.             Lynda Moss, who is also running for the seat, spoke this week about a column she wrote years ago, when she described “how Montana’s gun policies became a facade of the N.R.A. — a false front used to broadcast fear and misinformation perpetuating the myth of the Wild West.” Some supporters of gun rights said they were skeptical that attacking the N.R.A. would do any of the candidates much good in a state like Montana, where gun ownership is deeply entwined with the state’s history and culture.  “In Montana, every candidate is going to say, ‘I’m going to support the Second Amendment’ — and then some will add, ‘but,’ ” said Gary Marbut, the president of the Montana Shooting Sports Association, who has helped push nearly 70 gun rights bills into state law since the 1980s. The suddenly vocal critics of the N.R.A., he said, were “clearly political opportunists.” The group backed the Republican incumbent in the House race, Greg Gianforte, in a special election in 2017 and is expected to do so again this year, when he is favored to win re-election. Neither the N.R.A. nor Mr. Gianforte’s campaign responded to requests for comment for this article. Some Democrats in the state are confident that their party can succeed with a candidate who pushes away from the N.R.A. but finds a way to appeal to individual gun owners. “We’ve hit a moment in time where the N.R.A. is denigrating a whole lot of responsible gun owners, so it’s not that surprising that folks finally say, ‘Enough’s enough — they don’t represent me, and they don’t represent either the mainstream of America or the mainstream of firearm owners,’ ” Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, said in an interview in his office at the State Capitol. Still, some Democrats in the race have remained cautious. Grant Kier, who is seen as one of the front-runners in the primary along with Mr. Heenan, recently called Mr. Marbut of the sport-shooting group to discuss gun rights. “I think somebody who doesn’t respect people’s gun rights is not going to do well in Montana, period, regardless of the N.R.A.’s involvement,” Mr. Kier said. “I don’t see myself as running against the N.R.A.; I see myself as running against Greg Gianforte.” He said he sees health care, not gun safety, as the dominant issue in the campaign. “I think that being sensitive to people’s desires to find sensible gun laws in our state and country is important, but I think there are far more issues on people’s minds that we need to be working on, too, and I think that’s how we win this election,” he said. As the June 5 primary approaches in Montana, where the State Constitution decrees that the right to bear arms “shall not be called in question,” even those Democrats who have expressed deep misgivings about the N.R.A. appeared eager to show that they are not anti-gun. “We love our wildlife, and we love a good elk burger,” Ms. Williams said. “That’s different than things that threaten our kids at school.” A version of this article appears in print on April 12, 2018, on Page A20 of the New York edition with the headline: In Reddest Rural Districts, Democratic Candidates Defying the N.R.A.

None,295," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 10, 2018, 5:34 P.M. E.D.T. COLUMBUS, Ohio —  Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is ready to hit the campaign trail with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Richard Cordray. Warren will encourage early voting for Cordray at stops in Cincinnati and Columbus on Friday, his campaign told The Associated Press on Tuesday. A darling of the left and a favorite punching bag of Republican President Donald Trump and the right, Warren created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau where Cordray served as a director until jumping into the governor's race late last year. Her appearances come as Cordray faces a tightening primary race against former U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich.  Kucinich, initially viewed as a long shot, got a boost for the strong gun control positions he advocated after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, including calling for a statewide ban on assault-style weapons after the massacre that left 17 dead and has repeatedly called out Cordray for his past high marks from the National Rifle Association.  Two other main Democratic candidates and two Republicans are seeking nominations in the May 8 primaries to succeed Republican Gov. John Kasich, who is term-limited. Warren is expected to highlight Cordray's blueprint for fighting the opioid crisis during a Cincinnati stop at a substance abuse treatment facility.      Cordray, a former Ohio attorney general, has proposed a series of steps to address the deadly scourge caused by prescription painkillers and heroin, including protecting Medicaid expansion and boosting support for law enforcement and local treatment options. Warren also plans to tout Cordray's time as federal consumer watchdog, when he was often criticized for being too aggressive by banks and Congressional Republicans. They plan an afternoon stop in Columbus that will focus on Cordray's work at the bureau that they'll say benefited college students, the campaign said, including actions against for-profit colleges and unscrupulous student lenders. Rules the agency put in place under Cordray affect nearly every American who deals with banks or a credit card company or has a mortgage. A review of a CFPB database obtained by the AP through a Freedom of Information request shows that the bureau issued an average of two to four enforcement actions a month under Cordray. But the database shows zero enforcement actions have been taken since Nov. 21, 2017, three days before Cordray resigned. The banking industry has accused the bureau of overreaching in its regulation of consumer financial activities. Mick Mulvaney, appointed acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in late November by Trump, promised to shrink the bureau's mandate and take a much softer approach to enforcement.

National,296," By EMILY COCHRANE and JESS BIDGOODMARCH 20, 2018 GREAT MILLS, Md. — A male student at a high school in Maryland shot a 16-year-old girl he knew with a handgun on Tuesday, spurring a confrontation with an armed deputy stationed at the school, the authorities said. When the chaos was over, perhaps a minute after it began, the girl was critically injured, a 14-year-old boy was hurt and the gunman, whom the authorities identified as Austin Wyatt Rollins, 17, was fatally wounded. Great Mills High School, near a weather-beaten water tower in southern Maryland, became the latest scene of a school shooting, a little over a month after a teenager killed 14 students and three adults at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. “If you don’t think this can happen at your school,” said J. Scott Smith, the superintendent for St. Mary’s County, which includes Great Mills High, “you are sadly mistaken.”  The shooting here comes amid renewed urgency in the nation’s debate over gun control, with demonstrators around the country planning a nationwide march this weekend.  It is likely to draw further attention to the role of armed personnel in schools, which has been widely discussed after surveillance video showed that a sheriff’s deputy posted at the school in Parkland did not go inside a building to engage the gunman during that shooting, an apparent violation of protocol. The authorities were quick to praise the school resource officer at Great Mills High, Deputy Blaine Gaskill, who they said responded almost immediately to the gunman and fired his weapon. Deputy Gaskill was unharmed in the exchange. “He pursued the shooter, engaged the shooter,” Sheriff Timothy K. Cameron of St. Mary’s County said. The officer, he said, then “fired a round at the shooter; simultaneously the shooter fired a round as well.” But it was not immediately clear, the sheriff said, whether Deputy Gaskill’s shot had struck Mr. Rollins. And while Sheriff Cameron initially suggested that Mr. Rollins had shot both the 16-year-old and the 14-year-old victims, he said later that he was unable to confirm who had injured the 14-year-old, who was transported to a hospital in stable condition. Neither victim was identified by the authorities. Sheriff Cameron said it seemed a “prior relationship” had existed between the gunman and the female victim, although he did not say what it was. The sheriff said she was in the intensive care unit “with life-threatening critical injuries.” The F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sent agents to the school and were conducting a trace on Mr. Rollins’s weapon, Sheriff Cameron said. Deputy Gaskill’s intervention could increase calls for more schools around the country to add school resource officers, who play hybrid roles sometimes described as part security guard, part educator and part counselor. Currently, at least 30 percent of schools in the United States are believed to have such officers.  But some opponents argue that a police presence in schools increases the chances students will be arrested unnecessarily for minor infractions. There are few statistics on the effectiveness of school resource officers, although the Alabama-based National Association of School Resource Officers pointed to other instances in which it credited the presence of the officers for saving lives. In a 2013 shooting at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colo., that resulted in one student’s death, for example, a school resource officer was credited with preventing more carnage after pursuing the gunman into the school library, where he killed himself, according to Mac Hardy, chief of operations for the association. Great Mills High, like so many other schools across the country, was already reckoning with school violence in the aftermath of the Florida shooting. There had been new discussions about school safety. There was an ominous Snapchat posting about a possible threat, which stirred worry but was found to be a hoax. Last week, there was a walkout by students calling for stronger gun control measures. And then, shortly before 8 a.m. on Tuesday, the authorities said, Mr. Rollins pulled out his weapon and opened fire.      “It sounded like a shelf, like something fell,” said Shawnye Willis, 17, who was standing in the hallway, near an art class. But then he saw a girl fall forward, and collapse on the ground. When she dropped, he said, he knew it was serious. Teachers yelled for students to get into classrooms, and people began to cry. The principal, Jake Heibel, announced on the loudspeaker that the school was going into lockdown. Saar Shah, 15, was working on a robotics assignment when he saw the flashing lights of police cars pull up to the school. “I was thinking about this project,” Mr. Shah said. “I didn’t think my school was going to get shot up.”  Even students who had been deeply involved in gun control activism after the Parkland shooting, like Mollie Davis, who handed out stickers to fellow students during last week’s walkout, were stunned to find themselves at the center of an issue that had seemed urgent but far away. “I’m part of this now,” said Ms. Davis, 17, outside the nearby Leonardtown High School, where Great Mills students were taken to reunite with their parents. “It’s weird.” The shooting here was all but certain to spur new questions about the best way to protect schools. Mr. Smith, the superintendent, said Great Mills High and other schools in the district did not have metal detectors, although officials had discussed the possibility of getting them after the shooting in Parkland. “There is an associated cost related to that, as well as staff,” Mr. Smith said. Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, described the shooting as a call to action. As states around the country considered new gun control and school safety measures in recent weeks, Mr. Hogan proposed putting $125 million into school protection and $50 million to pay for school resource officers. He complained that the State Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, had not passed legislation to do so. “It’s outrageous to me that we haven’t taken action yet on something so important as school safety,” Mr. Hogan said. Alexandra Hughes, chief of staff for Michael E. Busch, the speaker of the state House of Delegates, called the governor’s complaints “unfortunate” and said the Legislature had included $30 million for school safety measures. She said Mr. Hogan had filed the school safety measure late in the session, but that lawmakers had advanced other measures, including a ban on bump stocks, an “extreme risk” law that would allow judges to take weapons away from dangerous persons, and legislation to remove guns from domestic abusers. Back in Great Mills, some students and parents said the shooting had pushed them to get involved in coming protests for stricter gun control. As Rayshawn Dickens, 38, went to pick up her 16-year-old daughter, Laquana, after the lockdown, she decided she would spend Saturday driving to Washington to join the “March for Our Lives” protest there. “They’re not safe in school,” Ms. Dickens said, of her daughter and her friends. “It’s scary.” Emily Cochrane reported from Great Mills, and Jess Bidgood from Boston.

National,297," By PATRICIA MAZZEIMARCH 4, 2018 MIAMI — The Florida State Senate shocked even itself on Saturday when it voted to approve a two-year moratorium on sales of AR-15 semiautomatic rifles, going far beyond the gun-related measures that Republican legislative leaders said they would consider. Tellingly, though, that two-year moratorium lasted only 15 minutes. It had been approved by a voice vote, and opponents quickly insisted on reconsidering it, this time with a roll call to formally record how each senator voted. Evidently that turned some of the ayes heard by the Senate president into nays, because the proposal was defeated, 21 to 17. The moratorium episode — the closest that Florida’s Democratic gun-control proponents have come to success after a Feb. 14 shooting rampage, at a high school in Parkland, left 17 people dead — illustrates why it is so difficult to pass firearm restrictions in the State Legislature: When it comes to backing a significant change, even a popular one, the votes just aren’t there. In the rare Saturday session, the Senate debated a Republican-sponsored bill that would raise the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21 from 18; mandate a three-day waiting period for most gun purchases; ban bump stocks, which enable semiautomatic rifles to fire much faster; and set up a voluntary program to arm trained schoolteachers and pay them a stipend to participate.  Democrats offered a slew of amendments over eight hours of debate on the bill, including a permanent ban on assault weapons and the elimination of the armed-teacher program. Both of those changes would be popular with Florida voters: A Quinnipiac University poll released last week showed that 62 percent favored an assault weapons ban and 56 percent opposed giving teachers firearms.  The 15 Democrats in the State Senate presented a united front, but it mattered little. Republicans hold 23 of the Senate’s 40 seats (two are vacant), leaving Democrats with too few votes to block bills on their own. And though the map of State Senate districts was redrawn by court order in 2016 to make it more fair, only a few Republican senators represent competitive districts, where voting against gun control might hurt them in a general election. As a result, Democrats managed to get just one amendment passed: adding 12 hours of required diversity training for participants in the program to arm teachers. That was meant to address black lawmakers’ concerns that teachers with guns might discriminate against black students in deciding when to use them. Students from the school in Parkland, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, sprang into political action after losing classmates and teachers in the Feb. 14 mass shooting. They traveled by the busload to Tallahassee, meeting with lawmakers, chanting in hallways and protesting on the steps of the State Capitol in favor of stricter gun laws.      But Parkland is in Broward County, the most heavily Democratic county in Florida. No Republican senator represents any part of the county; there was no chance of one of them breaking party ranks to side with student survivors from the district. The only two Republican senators who did consistently vote with the Democrats on Saturday were Anitere Flores and René García, representing neighboring Miami-Dade County. That is Florida’s most populous and most urban county, where even Republican constituents tend to be less strident about gun rights than in the rest of the state. A third Republican senator, Tom Lee, from the Tampa Bay area, joined in efforts to scrap the statewide armed-teacher program, which he called needlessly divisive, noting that local sheriffs and school superintendents can already set up such programs where they are wanted. Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, has maintained that he does not want to arm teachers. He is widely expected to run for a United States Senate seat this year, and knows he will have to appeal to voters beyond his own party in a race against the incumbent Democrat, Bill Nelson. But the calculus is different for the speaker of the House, Richard Corcoran, a likely candidate for governor in a crowded Republican field. Mr. Corcoran would like to appeal to President Trump’s voter base in his party’s primary, and he has backed the armed-teacher program enthusiastically, calling it a “game changer.” The Senate president, Joe Negron, also a Republican, suggested a possible compromise on Friday, arming noninstructional school personnel rather than teachers. Mr. Scott did not respond last week when asked whether he would accept that.  One way or another, though, Mr. Scott has said he is determined to pass the gun package, which would also include significant funding for school safety and mental health measures, before the end of the annual legislative session, which is scheduled to wrap up on Friday.

Learning,298," By KATHERINE SCHULTENMARCH 7, 2018 The protests calling for stricter gun control measures come on the heels of other youth movements, but the momentum they have gained makes them stand out. Updated: March 15, 2018 How much of a difference can young people make in addressing the problems our society faces? What makes their voices uniquely powerful? When have youth-led movements influenced policy in the past, and what can we learn from them? In this unit, students consider these questions as they examine gun-violence activism by teenagers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and discuss the planned school walkouts this spring. They can then go further by learning about youth movements in history, and, finally, considering actions they might take around the issues they care about. Please let us know how you’re addressing this teachable moment in your classroom, and how we might help. You might also invite your class to post comments in our Student Opinion forum, “Do You Think It Is Important for Teenagers to Participate in Political Activism?” _________ Charles Whitman opened fire on the University of Texas campus in 1966. Since then, the images of school shootings across America are almost indistinguishable. Warm Up: Ask students to respond in writing to the following questions, then discuss them in pairs, small groups or as a whole class: • Can people under age 21 make a real impact on society? For example, can they be instrumental in changing laws or policies on issues they care about? How? What examples from the past or present can you think of to support your opinion? List as many as you can.  • What qualities, skills, circumstances or perspectives are unique to young people — whether today or in the past — and how might they help make their voices uniquely powerful?  _________ Watch, Listen or Read: Demands for gun restrictions have followed one mass shooting after another, but little has changed. This time, the students who survived are leading the charge. Depending on how much time you’d like to spend, you can choose from three different options to have your students learn more about the activists at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. They can watch this video, also embedded at the top of this lesson; listen to the first 10 minutes and 20 seconds of an edition of The Times’s The Daily podcast, embedded above (stopping at the commercial break); or read this article from New York Magazine, “War Room: The teenage strategy sessions that built an anti-gun movement out of the trauma of Parkland in one week.” Or, use all three. As they watch, listen or read, have them take notes on this handout, which asks: What do these students want? What are they doing to achieve it? What impact are these actions having? Why? Invite them to share ideas in small groups, then, as a class, compile their lists on the board. Finally, follow up by asking students to discuss: • What actions seem to be most effective? Why? • Do you think these students be able to make a lasting impact on this issue? If yes, why? If no, why not? • What barriers might they run into? Why? • What suggestions do you have for these student activists? • What reactions or questions do these students’ activism raise for you? Why? If you like, you can then invite your students to add their responses to the forum we have posted in our Student Opinion section: Can High School Students Make a Real Impact on the Problem of Gun Violence in the United States?  For example, here is one comment we received from Jordyn I. of Westfield, N.J. Do your students agree? I believe that my generation has the power to change the world more than any group before us. Unlike the generations in decades past, we have more information available to us than ever before. Social media, arguably the most powerful tool of communication in the history of the world, is at our fingertips. With the click of a button, our words can be shared with millions. All it takes is one tweet, one post on Instagram or Facebook. And a second later, your opinion is broadcasted everywhere. The internet has empowered us to have the ability to change the world, even at the young ages that we are. Another option? Invite students to watch this video of students responding to the Parkland movement via the PBS Student Reporting Labs. _________  Discuss Student Rights in the Context of Planned School Walkouts At least two school walk-outs around gun violence have been slated for this spring. On March 14, a month after the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland, students and teachers across the country are planning to leave school for 17 minutes, one minute for each person killed in the attack. Another walk-out will take place on April 20, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine massacre. (A third protest, March for Our Lives, will happen on a Saturday, March 24.) Though some districts have threatened to suspend students, in New York City, the mayor has said he supports those who want to participate, and has even promised that the city will provide related lesson plans. In “How Young Is Too Young for Protest? A National Gun-Violence Walkout Tests Schools,” The Times reports that many elementary schools across the country are wrestling with the question of whether even kindergarteners should be involved. What is your classroom, school or district’s policy on walkouts? How many of your students plan to participate? Whether you support the walkouts or not, they are, as an article at Education Week put it, an opportunity to “elevate student voice and action as powerful teachable moments.” To help, you might gauge what your students know — or think they know — about their rights. Invite them to work in small groups to brainstorm answers to these questions, perhaps via a KWL chart: • Do people under 18 have the same rights as adults? If not, how do they differ — and why? • Do students under 18 have the same rights in school as they do out of school? If not, what examples can you give? After students have shared their thoughts and questions, invite them to read “School Walkouts in the Wake of ‘Parkland’ — Protected by the First Amendment or Not?,” a piece from the Newseum that offers helpful context and history: Marches, walkouts and sit-ins are the embodiment of our core freedoms: the right to speak out, to assemble peaceably and petition our government for change. Such protests recall powerful moments in the civil rights movement, when energized groups of young people caught the nation’s attention and successfully pushed for social and political change. The student voices in the Parkland movement also call to mind the circumstances around the landmark 1969 Supreme Court decision Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District, which also involved teens, schools and the freedom to protest. Then, have students follow this overview up with another Newseum resource, ”Classroom Walk-Outs and School Protests: Everything you need to know whether you’re a student, parent, teacher, school administrator, or lawyer” or with the ACLU’s page on “Students’ Rights: Speech, Walkouts, and Other Protests.” Still another resource? The new Youth in Front site, a community-created online learning resource, with advice from experienced youth activists and allies.  Challenge students to return to the original questions for which they brainstormed answers and correct or add detail to anything they now understand better. How would they summarize their answers? What questions are they left with? Where can they find answers? As a final activity for this part of the unit, students might produce a piece for their school website or newspaper clarifying student rights and responsibilities in the context of student activism on gun violence. To do this, they might interview school or district administrators, teachers and students; consult written school policy; and learn more about their school or community’s history of related student activism. Update, March 15: Your students can see videos and photos of and read about the March 14 walkout in “National School Walkout: Thousands Protest Against Gun Violence Across the U.S.” We have also posted a companion Student Opinion question, “Do You Think It Is Important for Teenagers to Participate in Political Activism?” _________ KQED’s The Lowdown has produced a timeline called Too Young to Vote, Old Enough to Take Action: A Brief History of Powerful Youth-Led Movements. To introduce it, Matthew Green writes: This is hardly the first time high school students have led the charge in pushing for nationwide reforms. In fact, the nascent Never Again movement follows in a long tradition of middle and high school students who, despite being too young to vote, have helped lead landmark social and political movements. Among the most recent (and often overlooked) examples include the young people on the front line of the Black Lives Matter movement, Dreamers activists fighting for immigration reform, and the group of American Indian youth who helped spark the Standing Rock movement in South Dakota last winter. As University of Oklahoma professor Kathryn Schumaker noted in a recent Washington Post commentary, student protesters have long risked disciplinary action or worse to force the nation to have difficult conversations about the future they stand to inherit. The Times has also taken on the topic, in a piece headlined “7 Times in History When Students Turned to Activism.” Maggie Astor writes that “history is full of movements led by students — albeit usually in college, not high school. Some were successful and others brutally crushed, but even the latter still resonate.” She also points out that “most of these campaigns have been liberal-leaning: Though conservative college students have made their presence known, their actions have rarely coalesced into broader movements.” Invite students to study the slide show, and read the Times article. What do these movements have in common? How do they differ? Then, invite them to choose one of featured movements and delve into it more deeply. As they do so, they might use the same chart they kept in the first part of this lesson to take notes: What did these students want? What actions did they take to get it? What impact did those actions have, and why? To report back to the class on their findings, they might answer a version of the same questions we asked about the current gun-violence activism: • What actions seemed to be most effective? Why? How were they unique to their time, place and circumstances?  • Can we still feel the impact of these students’ activism on this issue? How? • What barriers did they run into? Why? • What can student activists today learn from them? Raising Questions: Different Responses to Different Kinds of Activists? 
            ""Young black activists have been in the streets advocating for gun reform for decades without much attention or mass appeal, but that doesn't mean they don't exist, that they work without leadership, or that their demands are unclear."" #DoBetter https://t.co/s1VTWutlZA         As the Times article summarizes it, the Black Lives Matter movement began with three women in their late 20s and early 30s: Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi. But when it exploded into national view in 2014 after the police killing of Michael Brown, 18, many of the protesters who filled the streets of Ferguson, Mo., were students. But, as this piece in Teen Vogue argues, “Young black people have been fighting to save lives through gun reform laws for years without the support and energy given to the Stoneman Douglas students. In fact, black youth, who’ve been passionately advocating for gun control measures, have been demonized, obfuscated, and overlooked.” Parkland students themselves have credited Black Lives Matter as a model for their own movement: 
            Much of what I’ve done and wanted to do was inspired by Black Lives Matter. We’re protesting the exact same way and being called heroes just because the majority of us are white. America needs to do better in so many ways. https://t.co/TZp0ESCfIv         In early March, several of the Parkland students met with students in Chicago to talk about how to combat gun violence in communities nationwide. If your students choose this youth-led movement to research further, they might also address these questions: • Are there differences in how Black Lives Matter student activists have been received by the media and the public compared to the Stoneman Douglas students? If so, what do they think accounts for those differences? What evidence can they find to support their point of view? • What can, or should, be done — whether by the student activists themselves, by the media or by fellow citizens — to make sure all voices on an issue are heard? _________ Though we have focused on gun violence in this lesson, there are, of course, many other issues young people are passionate about. What problems in our world might inspire the students you teach to start or join a movement for change?  In our lesson plan “Ideas for Student Civic Action in a Time of Social Uncertainty,” we outline five steps students can take together, as explained by Chicago high school teacher Elizabeth Robbins in a TEDx talk: 1. Identify issues important in their lives and community, and decide on one to address. 2. Research the chosen issue and decide how to change or improve the situation. 3. Plan an action, including determining a goal for change; identifying who or what body in the community has power to make the change; and deciding how to approach that person or those people. 4. Carry out the action through letters, talks, meetings with officials, policy proposals, and activities, depending on the specific goals of the project. 5. Reflect on the effort when it is over in order to understand their successes, challenges, and ways to continue learning in the future. Though our lesson plan offers details for each step, below we’ve added a few more resources that may be helpful.  Identify Issues  Invite your students to write individually, then brainstorm as a group, as many answers as they can to these questions: • What issues do you care about? Why? • What changes do you want to see happen in your school, community, state, the country or even the world? Students might write their answers on the board, on sticky notes or in a shared class document so that everyone can see the range of ideas. Next, invite them to group what they find into several broad categories. Finally, have students team up around related issues to decide what to do next. Consider a Range of Actions Not everyone is comfortable speaking on camera, or walking out of school for a cause, yet everyone can find something to do to effect change.  Which of the actions students identified when reading about the Parkland students or about youth-led movements in history could help them bring change on the issue they have chosen? How? Below, a few options, each linked to a Times or Learning Network article that offers an example, ideas or more information: Engage with lawmakers. Use social media. Create a petition. Run for office. Raise money. Volunteer. Engage the press. Advocate to those in power to change rules or legislation. Write an editorial. Plan protests or other acts of civil disobedience. Educate others. Start programs that solve problems. Take legal action. Register to vote, encourage others to vote, and/or get involved in the push to lower the voting age to 16. Finally, Answer Ten Questions for Participatory Politics In “After Parkland, Students Choose to Participate,” our colleagues at Facing History recommend introducing students to powerful ideas for thinking about civic participation and social change, such as the political theorist Danielle Allen’s Youth Participatory Politics Framework. Ms. Allen suggests that when people choose to take action, they should consider the ten important questions above. How would your students answer them? To learn more, use the Facing History lesson plan Reflection and Action for Civic Participation that links to many different readings in which students can observe the questions in action. _________ 
            As with all historic tipping points, it seems inevitable in retrospect: Of course it was the young people, the actual victims of the slaughter, who have finally begun to turn the tide against guns in this country. https://t.co/Tvy1buS2da         From The New York Times Go Ahead, Millennials, Destroy Us 50 Years Later, It Feels Familiar: How America Fractured in 1968 The Snapchat Cohort Gets Into Politics, and Civics Is Cool Interactive Timeline | Black Activism on Campus  A ‘Mass Shooting Generation’ Cries Out for Change With Grief and Hope, Florida Students Take Gun Control Fight On the Road Don’t Let My Classmates’ Deaths Be in Vain My Teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas Saved Lives Emma González Leads a Student Outcry on Guns: ‘This Is the Way I Have to Grieve’ _________ From The Learning Network Our monthly feature Teenagers in The Times offers a roundup of articles that show young people taking action in a variety of contexts.

Culture,299," By ANDREW R. CHOWMARCH 15, 2018 The corner of Houston Street and the Bowery has been home to murals by some of the world’s most renowned street artists, from Keith Haring to Os Gêmeos to JR. The latest titan of street art to take over the giant canvas? Banksy. The anonymous British artist’s 70-foot-long mural was unveiled on Thursday, and it protests the imprisonment of the Turkish-Kurdish artist and journalist Zehra Dogan, who was sentenced last March for painting the destruction of a predominantly Kurdish town, with Turkey’s flag flying over rubble. “I really feel for her. I’ve painted things much more worthy of a custodial sentence,” Banksy said in a statement to the New York Times. Banksy’s sparse mural mostly consists of black hash marks, which visually represent jail cell bars and count the number of days that Ms. Dogan has spent in prison. (A similar array of hash marks also recently appeared in another protest art piece — “Parkland 17,” which counts the number of Americans killed by guns daily.) A rendering of Ms. Dogan herself peers out of one of the cells, with her left hand gripping a bar that doubles as a pencil. “Free Zehra Dogan” is written in the bottom right corner. She still has 18 months left to serve, and remains unaware of the mural, according to a news release.  The mural was a collaboration with the graffiti artist Borf, who has spent time in jail for his work.  # Nusaybin A post shared by  zehra doğan (@jinhazehradogan) on Jun 9, 2016 at 8:09am PDT On Thursday evening, Ms. Dogan’s grim painting was projected above the mural. It was based on a photograph of the Kurdish town of Nusaybin, which was partly destroyed in 2015 during fighting between the Turkish army and Kurdish militants; Ms. Dogan wrote in a now-deleted Tweet that she was imprisoned for painting “Turkish flags on destroyed buildings.” Slightly further uptown at 14th Street and Sixth Avenue, another Banksy work appeared, albeit much smaller: a rat, running inside a clock atop a former bank building that is slated for demolition. A version of this article appears in print on March 17, 2018, on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: Banksy Mural Protests Jailing of Turkish Artist.

Business,300," By THE NEW YORK TIMESFEB. 28, 2018 As soon as Dick’s Sporting Goods, one of the country’s largest sports retailers, announced on Wednesday that it would no longer sell assault-style rifles, a flood of readers reacted. Most applauded, including some gun owners. But others saw a public relations stunt on the day that school resumed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed two weeks ago. And some objected that their right to buy firearms was being attacked. The company also said it would no longer sell high-capacity magazines and would not sell any gun to anyone younger than 21, regardless of local laws. “I’m a gun owner and I commend Dick’s for doing this. I would gladly give up my right to own an assault style weapon if I thought it could save even one child. It really isn’t a hard decision to make.” — Larry Carino  “I have been with this company 19 years, and work in one of the original stores where the company was founded. I have tears in my eyes. I am smiling from ear to ear.” —  Cynthia Began   “For those who say they will no longer shop at Dicks … go ahead and shop elsewhere. Dicks will now make up those lost sales and more through their NEW customers!” — Becky Miller Price  “Apparently the young people of Parkland have made an impact, YES! Dicks has developed a social conscience, when will the politicians follow suit?” — Kathy Larit “As a gun owner and a concealed carry permit holder, I applaud you. No one needs this type of weapon other than an active military member!” — Catherine Stevens “A step in the right direction … I will order something from Dick’s online today.” — Ellen, California “The good news here is that even if Americans don’t vote, they sure do shop.” — Gloria, Massachusetts      ”It’s private sales and Gun Shows that need to be better regulated, because anything goes there.” — USMC1954, St. Louis “This is one way to help people avoid a background investigation — by forcing them to go to a shady dealer.” — Mark-Ginger Schreiber  “Corporations are doing this now as a way to make themselves look good and draw people to them, it’s not because it’s the right thing to do.” — Susan Strauss   “As long as they sell weapons they don’t get my money” — Mare Jeffries “A committed would-be criminal will just go to a dedicated gun store, and find a relative or friend to act as a straw buyer if he is under 21. This is a feel-good gesture and nothing more.” — Mark Lebow, Milwaukee “Won’t shop at Dicks anymore. Too bad people don’t realize what the second amendment is about. Cabelas will get all my business from now on which is significant.” — Robert Matthews, Buffalo  “Dicks is extremely overpriced anyway.” — Jim Gillies  “Another store no one shops in trying to be relevant.” — Aleks Black   “So they’re refusing to sell a certain type of gun AND denying service to a specific age group? Does that mean we get to call them bigoted just like those Christian bakers?” — Jordan Crump  “They’ve basically severed a part of their business to make a PR statement. Companies need to get out of politics all around.” — Scott, Paradise Valley, Ariz.   ",2018-02-28,0.0027116318,Wednesday
None,301," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 16, 2018, 4:07 P.M. E.D.T. SAUK RAPIDS, Minn. —  An 8-year-old student took a kitchen knife to a central Minnesota elementary school and randomly attacked three other children Monday, authorities said. Police Chief Perry Beise said the victims — aged 8, 9 and 13 — suffered ""superficial wounds"" requiring stitches in the attack at Pleasantview Elementary in Sauk Rapids. No one else was hurt. Beise told The Associated Press he didn't know why the boy did it. ""If I could answer that question I would,"" the police chief said. ""He randomly cut three students then walked into the office and set the knife down."" School Superintendent Bruce Watkins said the boy lashed out at the other students until an adult intervened. The incident lasted about 5 minutes and took place in a school hallway.  The incident happened about 7:15 a.m. as students were arriving for class, Watkins told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis. After putting his backpack away, the second-grade student took out a knife and slashed three students with it, the superintendent said. School officials immediately called police and an ambulance.  By the time officers arrived, Beise said, the boy was in an office with a counselor and the three injured students were being treated by the school nurse. He said the boy was cooperative with investigators. He said he didn't know if the boy had been bullied, or if he had mental health issues. Beise said the boy was released to his parents. The police report will be forwarded to the Benton County Attorney's Office.      ""They don't charge children this young with crimes,"" the chief said ""You try to get them treatment and help them be successful. It's also possible that human services will become involved in some way."" In an email to parents, school officials said that the parents of the three injured students chose to take their children home or to get additional medical attention on their own. One of the injured children is a seventh-grader who was waiting to catch a transfer bus. The other two are Pleasantview Elementary students. Watkins said the school made mental health counselors available to students and staff. Classes went on as scheduled. The attacker will not be allowed back in school, the superintendent said. Sauk Rapids is about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis. Pleasantview has 720 students in kindergarten through fifth grade, according to the school district's website. Weapons in schools and school security have been ongoing issues in the U.S. A 19-year-old former student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, is accused of bringing an assault rifle to the school in February and killing 17 students and staff members. In December 2012, Adam Lanza, 20, shot his mother to death at their Newtown, Connecticut, home before killing 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Lanza killed himself as police arrived at the school.  ",2018-04-16,0.0026548347,Monday
NYTNow,302," By KAREN ZRAICK and DAVID SCULLMARCH 23, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. More than 800 demonstrations against gun violence are planned on Saturday in the U.S. and around the world. The campaign, called the March for Our Lives, is being led by students and will include survivors of the Parkland, Fla., shooting and other attacks. This map shows where they will be held, and we’ll have live coverage starting Saturday morning. Above right, David Hogg, a student activist from Parkland, visited a school in Washington. Our video journalists profiled a 15-year-old who lost his brother to gun violence in Chicago. Now he’s getting ready to march in Washington. ____ 2. President Trump backed down from a threat to veto a $1.3 trillion spending bill. But he called it “ridiculous” and criticized lawmakers for not funding a border wall or coming to agreement on DACA.  And then, at the end of a head-spinning week in White House news, Mr. Trump headed down to Florida. ____ 3. We collected reaction from around the world to the news that John Bolton, the hard-line former ambassador to the U.N., will become President Trump’s national security adviser. American allies in Europe and Asia are fearful of Mr. Bolton’s hawkish views on Iran and North Korea.  And our investigative reporter wrote that a political action committee that Mr. Bolton founded was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica, the firm that came under fire for its use of data scraped from Facebook. ____ 4. The White House announced plans to impose tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese imports this week. But China’s response has been muted. Our correspondents in Beijing explained why. They say that the tariffs would have minimal impact on China and that Beijing has more effective weapons it could use in a trade war. Above, a steel plant in Shandong Province. ____ 5. A gunman in southwestern France killed three people in a burst of violence that included hijacking a car, shooting at police officers and opening fire and taking a hostage in a supermarket. Witnesses said the gunman claimed to be acting on behalf of the Islamic State, but it was unclear if he had any ties to the group. He was killed by the police when they stormed the supermarket. ____ 6. A New York firefighter was killed and two others were seriously injured by a fire at a building in Harlem that was being used as a film set.  Michael R. Davidson, 37, was a 15-year veteran of the department, with four commendations for bravery, and a father of four. He was somehow separated from other firefighters as the blaze intensified and forced them to pull back. The building, which was one of Harlem’s few remaining jazz clubs before it closed, was being used for the filming of “Motherless Brooklyn,” based on a book by Jonathan Lethem and directed by Edward Norton. ____ 7. A woman who says she was sexually abused by a teacher at an upstate New York private school in the 1990s bought three billboards to call him out. She was inspired by the movie “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” Kat Sullivan says she was abused by a teacher at the Emma Willard School. A report commissioned by the school concluded that the teacher was fired for sexual abuse — but was still given a recommendation to teach elsewhere. The statute of limitations has expired, leaving Ms. Sullivan with no legal recourse. So she bought the billboards, one of which pushes a bill that would give victims until age 28 to file criminal charges. ____ 8. Uber’s self-driving cars were struggling even before one struck and killed a woman in Arizona. Above, investigators inspected the vehicle. Our account is based on more than 100 pages of Uber documents and interviews with two people familiar with the company’s operations in the Phoenix area. Tech companies and automakers are spending billions developing self-driving cars in the belief that the market for them could one day be worth much more. The crash, which occurred Sunday night, is a major setback for Uber.  ____ 9. Our critic weighed in on the adaptation of “Frozen” that opened on Broadway this week, and it wasn’t pretty. He called it “sometimes rousing, often dull, alternately dopey and anguished.” He liked the first 20 minutes, though. Above, Caissie Levy as Elsa.

                MARCH 26, 2018 Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Tens of thousands of demonstrators across California marched in solidarity with national protests for gun control on Saturday, a sea of people awash in homemade signs, blaring music and anti-gun chants. Inspired by the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., Californians from San Diego to San Luis Obispo to Oakland showed their support. In Los Angeles, more than 30,000 people marched through downtown, according to an estimate by City Hall. Martha Jimenez-Ito, a teacher from Ventura County, said she attended the rally because she was tired of her young students feeling unsafe at school every time there’s a new shooting. She held a handwritten poster that said, “I will not stay quiet or accept unsafe schools.” She said she believed the tide was turning on gun legislation, despite little previous action. In the background, “Changes” by Tupac Shakur blasted over loudspeakers. Nearby, a young girl stood beside her pregnant mother and held an unadorned cardboard sign that simply asked, “Am I next?” The news and stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state).

Linda Wang, 39, said she was convinced there would be gun reform after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and was disappointed nothing happened. Originally from Taiwan, Ms. Wang said people outside the United States think gun violence in the country is “ridiculous.”  “There are shootings every day here,” said Ms. Wang, who has lived in the United States for 15 years. “We have to do something in America. This is not right.”  Omi Ford, 19, said she believed the large crowds emphasized how much energy is behind the gun control push this time around. “I’m here to show that the Parkland students are not alone in this, in their thinking about this, even though some people act like they are,” said Ms. Ford, an acting student at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles. The city’s mayor, Eric M. Garcetti, praised activists for their work and urged students to remain involved. Mr. Garcetti said President Trump had failed to show leadership on the issue despite promises after the Parkland shooting. “He said we shouldn’t be scared of the gun lobby and yet he buckles every time they blow a whistle for him,” he said. Nearby, a group of about 10 counterprotesters held up signs to support the Second Amendment, protected by police tape. More than a dozen police officers stood between the two camps. John Turano, 60, who wore American flag-imprinted shorts, said he decided to counterprotest in order to support the Second Amendment and “my president, Trump.” He said he did not own guns but thought efforts to restrict gun ownership were too extreme. He paused when asked what he thought about the marchers. “When you feel something passionately, and you’re in America, you’re not restricted in what you feel or what you say,” he said.

None,304," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 14, 2018, 5:19 P.M. E.D.T. LIMA, Peru —  The Latest on the Summit of the Americas meeting in Peru (all times local): 4:10 p.m. Vice President Mike Pence has joined heads of state from 15 hemispheric nations in calling on Venezuela to hold free and transparent presidential elections in which all political parties are allowed to participate. The seven-point statement was released on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas by a handful of mostly conservative-run countries that have been highly critical of Venezuela's socialist government, which was barred from participating in the regional gathering. It also calls on government to expand measures aimed at re-establishing Venezuela's democracy as well as urges the United Nations and other multilateral institutions to help alleviate the country's humanitarian crisis. ___ 3:30 p.m. Vice President Mike Pence in prepared remarks to regional leaders at the Summit of America twice recalled traveling to the border with Venezuela during a trip last year to Colombia. The problem is he never did.  Pence in a visit to Colombia last August did meet and pray with struggling Venezuelan migrants in a trip to Cartagena. But the colonial tourist mecca is several hundred miles from the border with Venezuela.  Despite the mistake, Pence in his speech said that it was time for the region to do more to isolate President Nicolas Maduro, who he said was single-handedly responsible for the humanitarian crisis plaguing the oil-rich nation. He added that the U.S. will not ""stand by idly"" as Venezuela ""crumbles"" and would work with its regional partners to restore Venezuelans' democratic ""birthright."" ___ 3 p.m. A press conference with U.S. Senator Marco Rubio took a heated turn when a journalist with Cuba's state-run newspaper Granma asked him about accepting campaign money from the National Rifle Association. After noting that the theme of this year's Summit of the Americas is stopping corruption, the Granma journalist asked Rubio if he would continue accepting money from the NRA after the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. When the journalist revealed what news outlet he works for a number of Miami-based reporters in the room began crying out that it was great he could be there because many of them haven't been allowed to enter and report in Cuba. Rubio chimed in saying he was willing to debate questions in an open forum and that anyone who doesn't agree with his position on the Second Amendment has the right to vote him out of office.      When pressed again by the reporter to answer his question, Rubio said he was glad they could have a discussion, ""because in Cuba we can't have a debate."" He didn't further address the shooting victims or whether he was considering changing his stance on accepting NRA funds. ___ 10:25 a.m. Peru's President Martin Vizcarra has opened the Summit of the Americas plenary session with a call for heads of state to approve a declaration with a list of measures aimed at preventing corruption.  The declaration was met with applause Saturday— but not everyone at the meeting in Lima, Peru, agrees on how to root out corruption. Bolivian President Evo Morales told his counterparts that the capitalist system allows corruption to prosper and said it should be dismantled. He also assailed the United States as the biggest threat to world peace and democracy. The theme of the summit is battling corruption though many are skeptical that any agreement reached will lead to practical change. ___ 10:15 a.m. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has endorsed the U.S.-led military strike against Syria's government. He says ""Canada stands with our friends in this necessary response and we condemn in strongest possible terms"" the use of chemical weapons in Syria. He made the comments Saturday at the Summit of Americas taking place in Lima, Peru. Trudeau said that Canada will work with others to investigate the use of chemical weapons on Syrian civilians and that ""those responsible must be brought to justice.""

National,305," By MATTHEW HAAG and JACEY FORTINMARCH 23, 2018 A 16-year-old girl critically injured in a shooting at a Maryland high school this week died on Thursday night after she was taken off life support. The girl, Jaelynn Willey, was “surrounded by her family” when she died shortly before midnight, the St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Office said. She had been at the University of Maryland Prince George’s Hospital Center since Tuesday, when another student shot her in the head in a hallway at their school in Great Mills, Md. Earlier on Thursday, her parents said that she was brain dead. “My daughter was hurt by a boy who shot her in the head and took everything from our lives,” her mother, Melissa Willey, said at a news conference at the hospital as she clutched her youngest child in her arms. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     Shortly before 8 a.m. on Tuesday, the police said, Austin Wyatt Rollins, 17, opened fire inside Great Mills High School with a handgun, striking Jaelynn and a 14-year-old boy. Jaelynn was shot in the head and collapsed in the hallway outside an art classroom, students said. The boy, Desmond Barnes, was shot in the thigh and was hospitalized. He has since been released.  The authorities were still trying to determine whether Jaelynn and her killer had had a relationship. The sheriff had said Wednesday that they did, but on Friday the office seemed to walk back that assertion, saying merely “they were acquainted.”  The shooting, which lasted about a minute, ended in a confrontation between the gunman and an armed school resource officer stationed at Great Mills High. The officer, Deputy Blaine Gaskill, responded almost immediately and fired his weapon at the gunman, who later died at a hospital. Deputy Gaskill was unharmed in the exchange. While it was not immediately clear if the officer struck Mr. Rollins, the deputy’s quick response brought renewed attention to the national debate over gun control and how to prevent mass school shootings after the killing of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last month in Parkland, Fla. Some politicians, including President Trump, have advocated arming teachers and placing additional police officers in schools. Others have criticized the idea. Survivors of the Stoneman Douglas shooting have organized the March for Our Lives, a rally to end gun violence planned for Saturday.  ",2018-03-23,0.0026078483,Friday
None,306," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 17, 2018, 7:46 P.M. E.D.T. MONTPELIER, Vt. —  A judge set bail at $100,000 Tuesday for a Vermont teenager accused in a school shooting plot that led to the first significant restrictions on gun ownership in Vermont history. Jack Sawyer, 18, has been held without bail since his arrest Feb. 15 on attempted aggravated murder and other charges. Prosecutors say Sawyer, who kept a journal entitled ""Journal of an Active Shooter,"" made detailed plans for a shooting at Fair Haven Union High School and said his goal was to kill more people than in any other school shooting. The Vermont Supreme Court last week ruled that in Sawyer's case ""preparation alone"" did not prove an attempt at aggravated murder, and said he should not be kept in jail. The ruling prompted Republican Gov. Phil Scott to urge lawmakers to close ""existing loopholes"" related to the attempt law and establish a domestic terrorism statute, although they cannot retroactively be applied to Sawyer's case.  On Monday, prosecutor Rose Kennedy filed two more charges against Sawyer: threatening and carrying a dangerous weapon with the intent of injuring someone for which the judge found probable cause.  Sawyer pleaded not guilty to all the charges. No bail was posted immediately after the hearing. Judge Thomas Zonay imposed conditions of release for Sawyer, including that he be under a 24-hour curfew and under the supervision of his father at his father's home in Poultney. The home must not have any firearms. Sawyer also must not have contact with students, teachers and staff at the high school and must contact a licensed mental health professional for an assessment within 72 hours of release. Sawyer's lawyer and father said they want to get him placed at the Brattleboro Retreat psychiatric hospital if a bed is available. Sawyer was arrested the day after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17, and the plot caused the governor to rethink his position on gun restrictions, to the dismay of pro-gun activists. Last week, Scott signed legislation that raised the age to buy firearms, banned high-capacity magazines and made it easier to take guns from people who pose a threat.      Kennedy used one of the new gun restrictions, obtaining an extreme risk protection order that said Sawyer poses an extreme risk of physical harm to himself and others and is barred from having any firearms. The prospect of Sawyer's release put the Fair Haven school and community on edge. Fair Haven Union High School parent Andrea Ochs attended Tuesday's court hearing alongside several students. I want us to feel safe,"" said Ochs, tearing up. Her two daughters attend the school she graduated from and the older one, a senior, had classes with Sawyer. ""Fair Haven, I mean, we're a great community. And we always take care of each other,"" she said. ""And it's very unnerving, unsettling, to know that one of our own would feel the way he feels and potentially harm my kids."" After the hearing, the high school superintendent Brooke Olsen-Farrell sent a letter to parents, teachers and staff saying school officials were working closely with law enforcement authorities. ""We will not disclose publicly all that we have done or how law enforcement will be keeping us safe, but we are confident that our buildings are safe,"" she wrote.  ",2018-04-17,0.0026059146,Tuesday

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday attacked conspiracy theorists who have suggested that students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. — where a gunman killed 17 people last week — might be actors. “I want you to consider this, especially if you are a Trump supporter or a member of the N.R.A. Do you really think these kids, these teenagers who spoke out after a shooting at their school, are actors who are part of some kind of deep-state, left-wing conspiracy? If the answer is ‘Yes, I do believe that,’ I have some bad news for you: You’re crazy. You’re a crazy person. Your brain is not functioning, and I’m worried about you.” — JIMMY KIMMEL Kimmel called on his viewers to stand up for established facts. “You can’t just sit there and let these scumbags spread these lies about these kids.” — JIMMY KIMMEL Stephen Colbert also expressed dismay at the so-called “crisis actors” theory. “That is wrong on a lot of levels. Not just because it diminishes the tragedy of what these kids experienced, but it also gives theater majors false hope that someday they’ll get jobs. I speak from experience here.” — STEPHEN COLBERT And Colbert attacked Florida lawmakers for refusing to debate a gun control bill, even after students from Stoneman Douglas showed up at the legislative session. “With Parkland students watching from the gallery, State House members voted down a motion to debate an existing bill that would ban assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines. So what legislation did they focus on instead? A bill that declares porn dangerous. What do you have against teenagers? First you won’t do anything about guns, now you’re taking away their porn. [Pretends to knock on door] ‘What are you doing in there? You better be loading a gun, young man!’ ” — STEPHEN COLBERT “Curling should be the cleanest event — the entire sport is sweeping. In fact, the only thing cleaner than the ice is the seats, because no one’s watching.” — TREVOR NOAH, responding to news that a Russian curler at the Olympics had been accused of doping “That’s not how investigations work. That’s like saying, ‘I’m the new police chief. When I was running for police chief, I stabbed a guy — a bunch. Why didn’t the old police chief stop me? There’s your crime, O.K.? Stabbity-stabbity, stab-stab-stab.’ ” — STEPHEN COLBERT, on a tweet by President Trump appearing to blame former President Barack Obama for Russian meddling in the 2016 election Trump misspelled the name of his attorney general in a tweet, and James Corden didn’t let him off easy. Donald Trump Jr., currently in India, said he was impressed that poor people in that country tended to have a “smile on a face.” Colbert created a Bollywood film “starring” him to memorialize the comments.

Opinion,308,"Opinion  In as many as a dozen states, schools have already taken advantage of laws that allow employees to carry guns. Ohio is one of them. A central Ohio elementary-school teacher practicing her stance at a weapons training workshop in 2014.CreditPhotographs by Kate Way Supported by By Kate Way It was a blistering day in June 2015, and the sun beat down relentlessly. The only shelter was a small makeshift shed, hidden behind an overgrown embankment next to an almost inaccessible stretch of railroad tracks in a remote area of central Ohio. It was the kind of place that you’d never find without a detailed map, one I typically wouldn’t, as a woman, visit alone. But there were more than 20 women and men there when I arrived, all of them heavily armed.  It was Day 2 of a free, three-day gun training class in Rittman for K-12 public school employees offered by the Buckeye Firearms Association, an Ohio-based gun rights organization. Most attendees were from Ohio schools. Some worked for school districts that were already arming teachers; others hoped to persuade their schools to do so. Many were attending in secret and did not want their employers to know they were there. I was there as a co-producer of the forthcoming documentary film “G Is for Gun: The Arming of Teachers in America.” Over the past three years, I’ve met dozens of teachers, administrators, secretaries, custodians, bus drivers and school nurses in Ohio willing to carry a gun at work and respond with force against an active shooter. Until several weeks ago, when 17 people were gunned down at a Parkland, Fla., high school, the trend of  schools arming teachers had received little national attention. Now President Trump is leading the charge to arm teachers. But many people remain unaware that schools in about a dozen states, according to my reporting, have already taken advantage of state laws that allow school employees to carry guns. For most of the people interviewed for this project, the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a tipping point on the issue — either a compelling argument for gun control or a clarion call to take up arms for protection. Much of the authority over whether to allow guns in schools rests at the state and local levels. In Ohio, school boards are allowed to arm school personnel but are not required to notify the public that they have done so. In some states, teachers and other employees can carry a gun without anyone’s knowledge, including that of school authorities, so long as they hold a valid concealed-carry permit. No one knows how many schools in the United States have armed teachers or staff members. In Sidney, Ohio, a small city west of Columbus, the school board voted to arm teachers in 2013, just after the Sandy Hook massacre in December 2012. Much of the city and surrounding area is struggling. Schools, health care centers and other social services in the area strain to meet the community’s needs. Even so, the Sidney school board agreed to create and maintain an armed-response program at an annual cost of nearly $200,000 that includes armed security officers and trained teachers and staff members who have access to guns stored in safes in the schools.  The municipal police department opposed the plan, fearing that more guns would only create chaos in an emergency. The local teachers union also objected, taking its complaint to the state labor-relations board, which concluded that arming teachers did not qualify as a change in working conditions. Though guns in Sidney’s schools must be kept in safes, many school employees I spoke to there said they were fearful about their colleagues’ quick access to guns. A few expressed concern about the stability of some on the response team.  At least 26 school employees have volunteered to be on the armed-response teams. Superintendent John Scheu says his phone has been ringing constantly with inquiries from other Ohio school districts interested in carrying out their own plans. Buckeye Firearms can hardly keep up with the demand for its courses. As many as 50 to 100 school districts in the state are thought to now have armed teachers. While much of the nation is loudly debating the prospect of arming teachers in the wake of the Parkland massacre, the decision has already been made in much of Ohio. Kate Way, a photographer, filmmaker and educator based in Massachusetts, is a co-director and a co-producer, with Julie Akeret, of the documentary film “G Is for Gun.”      Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS",2018-03-24,0.0025784848,Saturday
None,309," By REUTERSAPRIL 20, 2018, 5:25 P.M. E.D.T. LITTLETON, Colo. —  Demanding an end to gun violence and tougher restrictions on firearm sales, thousands of students again walked out of classes across the United States on Friday in hopes of putting pressure on politicians ahead of November's midterm elections. Timed to coincide with the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre, students left classes at  midmorning, many waving placards with slogans including ""I should be worried about grades, not guns,"" and ""Enough is enough."" Organizers said students from more than 2,600 schools and institutions were scheduled to take part, but that was fewer than participated in a similar walkout last month. In some places, demonstrators even met with resistance from school administrators. ""Today is about being proactive and being empowered and really funneling all that energy and anger we have as young people into some productive change,"" one of the student organizers, Lane Murdock of Connecticut, told Reuters.  Olivia Pfeil, a 16-year-old sophomore from a high school in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, held a sign bearing the names of mass shooting victims. ""We're expecting change or come next election cycle we will support politicians who are listening to the voices of the youth,"" she said.  It was the second student walkout since the Feb. 14 massacre of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and the emergence of a national student movement to end gun violence and toughen restrictions on firearms sales. Many of the demonstrators wore orange, a color that has come to represent the movement against gun violence. A 13-second silence was observed in honor of the 13 killed at Columbine. At the Texas statehouse in Austin, about 1,000 students, many waving signs and chanting anti-NRA slogans, demanded stricter gun control measures. “Because we can’t vote, this is the only way we can make our voices heard,” said Graeclyn Garza, a second-year student at McCallum High School in Austin, who waved a sign reading “Enough.” Outside the White House, protesters sat in silence while they listened to the names of gun violence victims read aloud. ""It happened like 20 years ago,"" said Ayanna Rhodes, 14, a student at Washington International School, referring to Columbine, ""And we are still getting mass shootings in schools."" Two gunman went on a shooting rampage at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, leaving 12 students and a teacher dead before killing themselves in a massacre that stunned the nation. But since then, school shootings have become commonplace.  Even as students prepared for their protest on Friday morning, news broke that a 17-year-old student had been wounded in a shooting at a high school near Ocala, Florida. A suspect was arrested soon afterward, police said. The latest gun violence unfolded about 225 miles (360 km)northwest of the Parkland high school, where two months ago a former student killed 17 people in the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history. Despite widespread revulsion over the school shootings, the issue of gun control remains sensitive in Colorado and across the country, where the Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms.      'OPPOSE THEM AT EVERY STEP' Dudley Brown, president of the Colorado-based National Association for Gun Rights, said the gun-control movement seeks to have the government take away constitutional rights. ""The main objective of these students is to ban firearms completely, and confiscate the firearms of law-abiding Americans,"" Brown said. ""We will oppose them at every step."" In some conservative school districts, administrators told students they could face disciplinary steps if they walked out. In suburban Dallas, a dozen students dressed in orange chanted ""End gun violence!"" as they huddled in a parking lot across the street from North Garland High School. Freshman Victoria Fierro, 14, said school administrators blocked the doors when about 50 students tried to leave, so a small group exited through a side door. ""They told us we would get in trouble if we walk out, and we told them it was a peaceful protest, we're not causing any damage,"" Fierro said. ""This is over a serious topic that people are pushing aside.""  The principal declined to answer questions from Reuters. It was not immediately clear whether Friday's turnout matched those of earlier protests. More than a month ago, tens of thousands of students from some 3,000 schools participated in the #ENOUGH National School Walkout to demand tighter gun control regulations. On March 24, ""March For Our Lives"" rallies in cities across the United States were some of the biggest U.S. youth demonstrations in decades, with hundreds of thousands of young Americans and their supporters taking to the streets. On the evening before the walk-outs, Colorado gun control activists rallied near Columbine High School. Carlos Rodriguez, a 17-year-old junior from Marjory Stoneman, traveled to Columbine for the anniversary and said he found a sense of solidarity in the outpouring of support. ""That's the only thing that's keeping us Douglas students alive right now: the distraction of fighting for our rights and advocating for our lives,"" Rodriguez told Reuters. There was no walkout on Friday at Columbine, which has not held classes on April 20 since the massacre. Students were encouraged to take part in community service instead.

Express,310," By AUSTIN RAMZYAPRIL 11, 2018 A photographer captured two pages of Mark Zuckerberg’s notes for his appearance at a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Once highlighted on Twitter, the image was retweeted thousands of times. To many commenters, the paradox was clear. On a day Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, faced lawmakers’ questions about whether his company adequately protected users’ data, he experienced a disclosure of his own. The talking points gave a detailed view of Facebook’s extensive preparations for the appearance before Congress of its billionaire founder. While some of the notes matched what he said on Tuesday, others reminded him what not to say or anticipated questions that were not raised. Mr. Zuckerberg will appear Wednesday for another day of testimony. One section of the notes suggested responses in case Mr. Zuckerberg was asked if he would step down. He was not asked that question, but the suggested reply indicated he planned to stay.  “Resign?” read the notes, which were written in an abbreviated form. “Founded Facebook. My decisions. I made mistakes. Big challenge, but we’ve faced problems before, going to solve this one. Already taking action.”  The notes also included what Mr. Zuckerberg should say if asked whether Facebook should be broken up. “U.S. tech companies key asset for America,” was the suggested reply. “Breakup strengthens Chinese companies.” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, asked if Facebook was a monopoly. But he did not press Mr. Zuckerberg on whether the company should be divided, and the answer citing Chinese competition was not used. “You don’t think you have a monopoly?” Mr. Graham asked. “It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me,” Mr. Zuckerberg replied. Mr. Zuckerberg’s notes also guide a response to recent criticism from Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, who has described his own company as a far more robust defender of consumer privacy. “Lots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple notify people,” read the notes. But Mr. Cook’s comments were not raised during the hearing, and the response was not used. Another section warns Mr. Zuckerberg about comments to avoid. In response to any questions about European Union privacy and data protections, the notes instructed that he should not say Facebook already complies with a data privacy law that goes into effect in May.      The image was photographed by Andrew Harnik of The Associated Press and was included in a tweet from Stefan Becket, a senior news editor at CBSNews.com, that was shared widely. “I took 70 photos of Zuck today,” Mr. Harnik wrote in response. “Leave it to the writers to love the photograph of pages of text.”  Mr. Harnik said he didn’t think the photo constituted the sharing of private information. “He left it on the desk surrounded by probably upwards of 100 film and still cameras pointed at the desk from every direction,” he tweeted. “I do not think that constitutes an invasion of privacy.” Photos of notes during official events have a long history of revealing more information than those who held them intended. In 1975, a photograph of then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger at the Helsinki Accords showed him reading a document with the heading “TOP SECRET SENSITIVE EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY CONTAINS CODE WORD.” The document, which discussed diplomatic relations between France and North Vietnam based on a C.I.A. source with access to the French Foreign Ministry, undermined ties between Washington and Paris, Lawrence Martin-Bittman, a Boston University scholar, wrote in 1981. More recently, President Trump was photographed during a meeting with parents, students and teachers who lost loved ones in the Parkland, Fla., school shooting holding notes that included the line, “I hear you.” The image raised questions about his ability to empathize with people who were grieving.

                APRIL 6, 2018 Have you heard about the #WalkUpNotOut movement? A father of a Parkland, Fla., shooting victim proposed the demonstration in the tweet below: 
            The #March4OurLives supporters will accomplish only two things. 1. They'll exercise their 1st Amendment right. 2. They'll get a little exercise. If you really want to stop the next school shooter #walkupnotout pic.twitter.com/9kY3k53xcr         What message do you think this campaign is trying to send? What is your initial opinion of it? In “I Tried to Befriend Nikolas Cruz. He Still Killed My Friends.,” Isabelle Robinson writes: My first interaction with Nikolas Cruz happened when I was in seventh grade. I was eating lunch with my friends, most likely discussing One Direction or Ed Sheeran, when I felt a sudden pain in my lower back. The force of the blow knocked the wind out of my 90-pound body; tears stung my eyes. I turned around and saw him, smirking. I had never seen this boy before, but I would never forget his face. His eyes were lit up with a sick, twisted joy as he watched me cry. The apple that he had thrown at my back rolled slowly along the tiled floor. A cafeteria aide rushed over to ask me if I was O.K. I don’t remember if Mr. Cruz was confronted over his actions, but in my 12-year-old naïveté, I trusted that the adults around me would take care of the situation. Five years later, hiding in a dark closet inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, I would discover just how wrong I was. I am not writing this piece to malign Nikolas Cruz any more than he already has been. I have faith that history will condemn him for his crimes. I am writing this because of the disturbing number of comments I’ve read that go something like this: Maybe if Mr. Cruz’s classmates and peers had been a little nicer to him, the shooting at Stoneman Douglas would never have occurred. This deeply dangerous sentiment, expressed under the #WalkUpNotOut hashtag, implies that acts of school violence can be prevented if students befriend disturbed and potentially dangerous classmates. The idea that we are to blame, even implicitly, for the murders of our friends and teachers is a slap in the face to all Stoneman Douglas victims and survivors. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: — What issues does Ms. Robinson have with the idea that being nicer to your peers can prevent school violence? Do you agree or disagree with any of these? Do you see any other problems with this sentiment? — Has your opinion about #WalkUpNotOut changed after reading this Op-Ed essay? Why or why not? — To what extent do you think anti-bullying campaigns can prevent school violence and why? What, if any, other measures should be taken to make schools safer? Who should be responsible for them — students, teachers, administrators, parents, lawmakers or someone else? — Do you have any personal anecdotes like Ms. Robinson’s in which your kindness toward a classmate did or did not make a difference? If so, what was the experience like? How does it influence your opinion on this topic? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

Sports,312," By KEN BELSONAPRIL 4, 2018 The New England Patriots receiver Julian Edelman was in Texas visiting his former teammate Danny Amendola late last month when he received a direct message on his Instagram account: “Dude, there is a kid in your comment section says he s going to shoot up a school, i think you should alert the authority.” Edelman instantly thought of the mass shooting about five weeks earlier in Parkland, Fla., in which 17 people were killed. “With the emotions of what happened, and I have a kid now, I said, holy Toledo, what is going on?” Edelman said in an interview this week. He quickly notified his assistant in Boston, Shannen Moen, who looked through the hundreds of comments that followed Edelman’s most recent post on Instagram. She found the alarming message: “I’m going to shoot my school up watch the news.” Moen called 911, and a police officer soon arrived. The officer saw the screen shot, then called her chief, who sent two detectives to Moen’s house. The detectives collected some information about the person who posted the threat. They then returned to their office, where they made an emergency records request for account information, which allowed them to determine the sender’s email and IP address, which was traced to Port Huron, Mich.  The detectives called police in Michigan, who immediately drove to the house where the threatening message originated. When the police arrived at the address, they found a 14-year-old boy, who, they said, admitted to posting the threat. They also found two rifles that belonged to his mother, according to Capt. Joseph Platzer of the Port Huron Police Department.  Platzer said the boy’s threat was aimed at the middle school that he attends in a nearby township. The boy was taken to a juvenile-detention center, where he remains. He was charged with making a false report of a threat of terrorism, a felony that is punishable by up to four years in jail. “Any time someone makes a threat to shoot up a school or building, we take it very seriously,” Platzer said. The case was sent to the local district attorney’s office and the boy has had one court hearing. Back in Boston, Moen said she is relieved a potential crisis was averted. “When I told Julian, he was in shock,” Moen said. “We’re very lucky the Boston cops were all over it, very lucky the Michigan cops were all over it.” Moen said Edelman wanted to thank the person who sent him the direct message for his vigilance. (Someone with the Instagram handle jesseyi3.) Moen has reached out to that person, but so far has received no response. “Thankfully, this kid said something,” said Edelman, who has played in three Super Bowls with the Patriots in his eight-year N.F.L. career. “We’re going to send him something, a care package, just for his work. He’s the real hero.” A version of this article appears in print on April 5, 2018, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Patriot Helps Thwart Potential School Shooting.

                New York Today             By                     
                                    ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE
                            
                MARCH 14, 2018 Good morning on this cloud-shrouded Wednesday. This morning, instead of attending his usual seminar on United States government, Andrew Myers will address those in power. Mr. Myers, a senior at the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights, is one of tens of thousands of students nationwide who will walk out of classrooms today to protest gun violence, following the killing of 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., a month ago. Roughly 1,000 Brooklyn students are expected to rally in solidarity today at Borough Hall, according to Mr. Myers, one of the event’s organizers. Dozens of schools in all five boroughs have registered to take part in walkouts as well. Most of the students involved are too young to vote. Until he turned 18 in January, Mr. Myers was one of them — an impetus for his civic engagement. “This is our only outlet,” he said. “We can’t do anything other than protest.”  New York City schools have been relatively safe; the fatal stabbing at a Bronx high school in September was the first killing inside a city school building in more than two decades. Even so, students here inevitably feel the fear and uncertainty that follow school shootings.  Since February, though, a wave of student activism has taken hold, led by the survivors of the Parkland shooting. In rallies, news media appearances and town hall-style events, they have demanded action from elected officials — and that, too, has spread to New York. “Politicians have absolutely failed us,” Mr. Myers said, “and we’re marching today to let them know that we’re here, that we care about this issue, that we’re the next voting bloc that’ll be out there in the midterm elections.” He added, “Politicians are bringing up the same talking points they always bring up — mental health, violent video games and student safety — which are all relevant topics, but they all ignore the root of the problem: guns.” The school has been supportive of the student-led effort and faculty members who decide to march, Mr. Myers said. The Department of Education has also released guidelines for walkouts around the city: • Middle and high schools will not prevent students from participating. • Students engaging in peaceful protest will not be arrested, but those putting people or property in danger may be disciplined accordingly. • Leaving for 17 minutes — to honor the 17 Parkland victims — will be treated as cutting class, not an absence. At Packer Collegiate Institute, Mr. Myers said, “they just want us back in school by 1:15.” Here’s what else is happening: Meh. There’s a slight chance of flurries this afternoon and evening. Otherwise, it’s going to be a gray day with temperatures that could feel as nippy as the 20s.  The second half of the week (and the weekend) is, for the time being, looking splendid. • Joseph Percoco, the former top aide to Gov. Andrew M.

                MARCH 14, 2018 Before reading the article:  Today’s article begins: It started out last month as a writing exercise on the 1963 Birmingham Children’s Crusade, when more than 1,000 students skipped school and marched to demand civil rights. Then the class assignment mushroomed into a plan — hatched by 10- and 11-year-olds — to stage a little civil disobedience of their own. Watch the five-minute clip below, from the Teaching Tolerance film “Mighty Times: The Children’s March,” which features recollections of some of the participants of that unified, nonviolent protest in Birmingham, Ala., 55 years ago. What are your reactions to hearing about the 1963 civil rights protest from the student activists, now grown adults? What other examples can you think of where groups of students or teenagers exercised their First Amendment rights for a cause or to effect change? Now, read the article, “How Young Is Too Young for Protest? A National Gun-Violence Walkout Tests Schools,” and answer the following questions:  1. What is planned for the morning of Wednesday, March 14, in Craig Sampsell’s fifth-grade class at Case Elementary School in Akron, Ohio? 2. What does the principal, Danjile Henderson, have to say about the student protest at her school, and what lines has she drawn around who can participate and how?  3. What are some of the ways schools and administrators are handling the walkout and why, according to the article?  4. What are some parents hoping for, or concerned about, according to the article? 5. What are some of the details the article gives about walkout plans for other classrooms and districts around the country, and what is their rationale for their decision? 6. What did Maeva Lile say about her friends and classmates and their plans for Wednesday’s walkout? Why does she think it is time for children to protest? Finally, tell us more about what you think: Will you or your classmates participate in a school walkout to protest gun violence or to honor the students who died in Parkland, Fla.? Do you know what other schools or classes are doing, if anything? Either way, what are your thoughts about what is planned, or not planned, and why? How young is too young for a protest, in your opinion? Does the type of protest, or the venue, matter? Why or why not?

                FEB. 22, 2018 Before reading the article:  Watch the video “How Do Russian Bots Work?” below. Then, answer the questions: — What is a “bot”? — What are some of the tactics bots use? — What is one way these tactics have affected individuals or society? How do bots and trolls work to infiltrate social media platforms and influence U.S. elections? We take a closer look at these insidious online pests to explain how they work. Now, read the article, “On Social Media, Lax Enforcement Lets Impostor Accounts Thrive,” and answer the following questions:  1. What argument do the authors make about bots in the first six paragraphs of the article? What are three pieces of evidence they use to support that argument? 2. Where do impostor accounts come from? 3. What are some of the reasons these fake accounts are created? 4. How do Facebook and Twitter’s impersonation policies and enforcement — or lack thereof — allow bots to thrive?  5. What steps are these companies making to prevent impostor accounts on their sites? 6. How do bots affect people’s personal and professional lives? 7. Why is it far easier to build a bot than to kill one on most social media platforms? Finally, tell us more about what you think:  In addition to being harmful to individuals, social media bots and trolls have also had a significant impact on society: Millions of accounts impersonating real people roam social media platforms, promoting commercial products and celebrities, attacking political candidates and sowing discord. They spread fake images and misinformation about the school shooting last week in Parkland, Fla. They were central to Russian attempts to sway the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald J. Trump, according to a federal grand jury indictment on Friday. And American intelligence officials believe they will figure in Russian efforts to shape the coming midterm elections, too. In your opinion, does more need to be done to prevent the proliferation of fake accounts? Why or why not?  If so, who should be responsible for combating these bots and what should they do? For example, should social media companies make it more difficult to create accounts? Should they have stronger policies and enforcement? Or should they have more oversight from the government?

National,316," By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.APRIL 3, 2018 The 1960s were known for their turmoil, but the degree to which guns were a factor is sometimes overlooked. Not only was a president assassinated, but an ex-Marine opened fire from an observation deck in Austin and the homicide rate leaped by more than 50 percent, driven by fatal shootings. Gun sales soared, prompted by fears of violence and rioting. But the mayhem and violence didn’t seem to move a Congress that refused to take gun-control legislation seriously. It would not even approve a proposal to outlaw the mail-order purchase of rifles, like the one Lee Harvey Oswald bought for $19.95, plus shipping and handling, and used to kill President Kennedy. One of the few major gun control measures enacted, in California, was a reaction not to violence but to the Black Panthers’ exercising their right to bear arms by patrolling with loaded rifles. The political calculus began to change on April 4, 1968. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was gunned down in Memphis. Nine weeks later, Senator Robert F. Kennedy was fatally shot in Los Angeles.  Finally, gun control became a possibility — at least in the hands of President Lyndon B. Johnson, a master at turning tragedy into legislative gain. He had used the death of President John F. Kennedy to pass the Civil Rights Act, and wrung the Voting Rights Act from the Bloody Sunday march from Selma to Montgomery. Now he would try for the Gun Control Act.  Today, it’s not clear that any shooting could be awful enough to embolden Congress to thwart the National Rifle Association. But even back then, the N.R.A. throttled much of what Mr. Johnson intended to do. “The voices that blocked these safeguards were not the voices of an aroused nation,” an angry president said at the bill signing. “They were the voices of a powerful lobby, a gun lobby, that has prevailed for the moment in an election year.” He called on “those of us who are really concerned about crime” to fight for stronger laws. “We have been through a great deal of anguish these last few months and these last few years — too much anguish to forget so quickly.” The new law outlawed gun sales to felons, drug abusers, minors and those with mental illness; banned most out-of-state and mail-order gun sales; and sharply curbed imported weapons, including the cheap, tiny pistols used in many homicides. It remains a cornerstone of federal gun law today. The King assassination spurred the legislation not just because it horrified the nation, but also because it prompted unrest across the country, including in Washington, where lawmakers watched rioters come within blocks of the White House as thousands of federal troops were mobilized. “It was in Congress’s backyard, so they didn’t have to read about it in the newspapers. They could see it,” said Larry Temple, a high-ranking aide and special counsel to Mr. Johnson. “The death of Dr. King and the resulting riots in Washington had an impact on Congress and what they wound up doing.” But it wasn’t until June 5, when Senator Kennedy was assassinated, that the logjam looked like it would break. A day later, a modest gun-control proposal that had languished passed Congress, raising the age to buy handguns to 21.  Still, Mr. Johnson wanted something far more sweeping. He proposed to treat guns like cars: They would be registered and their owners would be licensed. Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.     Had something like this passed, gun-control proponents say, the United States today might look more like Britain or Australia, countries where guns are tracked and gun violence is a fraction of what it is here. “He said, ‘We have about 10 days or two weeks to get it passed,’” recalled Joseph Califano, his chief domestic adviser. “‘If we don’t get it out of committee by then, the N.R.A. will kill us.’” This time, there has been no similar urgency in Washington, even as hundreds of thousands of protesters in the capital and elsewhere have demanded changes after the killing of 17 students and staff at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Crime is less a concern, as the murder rate has fallen sharply since the sixties. But mass shootings have become frighteningly common. Anyone — or anyone’s child — could be a victim, at a school, a concert, a church, a movie theater or a nightclub. And while a smaller percent of households own guns, the country has more of them, and they are deadlier: Semiautomatic rifles like the AR-15 have become the weapon of choice in the largest recent mass killings, leading to death tolls in the dozens. Most people today favor tighter gun restrictions, polls indicate, just as they did a half-century ago. But the N.R.A. also wields political power disproportionate to the size of its membership, as it did then. In 1968, the organization was not yet as uncompromising as it is today. But it used tactics that would feel familiar now. It flooded its members with sky-is-falling warnings about the government taking away gun rights, and urged them to hound lawmakers. In a letter to 900,000 N.R.A. members in June 1968, the organization’s president, Harold W. Glassen, said that the “right of sportsmen” to lawfully own and use firearms was “in the greatest jeopardy in the history of our country.”  Frustrated gun-control backers called it “calculated hysteria and distortion.” But it was profoundly effective. In its coverage that month, The New York Times called the gun lobby among the most effective in Washington, citing the association’s ability to get “sportsmen, farmers and gun lovers to put pressure on their congressmen.” Soon, Mr. Johnson’s favored provisions were shorn from the bill by his old cadre of fellow Southern Democrats.  “Strom Thurmond is hostile as hell, and so is Jim,” — James O. Eastland, Democrat of Mississippi — “and they’re mutilating the bill as it is,” the leader of the Senate Republicans, Everett Dirksen of Illinois, told Mr. Johnson in a recorded phone call on July 24, 1968 that is in the Mr. Johnson’s presidential library. (Senator Thurmond was by then a Republican.) The licensing and registration provisions passed neither chamber, and triumphant pro-gun forces announced it was now legislation they could “live with.” To which Representative Charles S. Joelson, Democrat of New Jersey, responded: “I suggest that tens of thousands of Americans can die with it.” The Gun Control Act was signed into law that fall. Two years later, the N.R.A. helped defeat the re-election bid of a leading Senate proponent of tough gun laws, Joseph D. Tydings, Democrat of Maryland, a man who had won his seat just six years earlier in a landslide.  By now the N.R.A. has perfected the art of going after lawmakers who defy the organization. That is one reason the demands of mass shooting survivors and their allies, now led most visibly by the Parkland students, remain so far apart from the measures Congress is considering. In 1956, after his house was bombed, Dr. King applied to the local sheriff for a permit to carry a concealed handgun. He was denied on the grounds that he was “unsuitable,” according to Adam Winkler, the author of “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.” Friends and relatives who feared for his safety urged him to hire a bodyguard and armed watchmen, he wrote in his autobiography. But soon, he and Coretta Scott King, his wife, reconsidered and gave up the one gun they owned. “How could I serve as one of the leaders of a nonviolent movement and at the same time use weapons of violence for my personal protection?” he wrote. Fifty years ago, the death of great leaders prodded Congress to act on gun control. Now, at a similar juncture, it is the death of schoolchildren that has stirred the makings of a movement. It remains uncertain whether the current movement for gun restrictions will result in meaningful reform. So far, the main impetus is in state legislatures. “Even in Republican-controlled states it appears there is at least some openness to doing something, building on the foundation laid over the last five years in less conservative states,” said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. But he said Congress may not do much unless midterm elections shake things up. For Dr. King, who would have turned 89 in January, getting rid of his gun helped him reckon with his mortality and focus on his movement. “From that point on, I no longer needed a gun nor have I been afraid,” he wrote. “Had we become distracted by the question of my safety we would have lost the moral offensive and sunk to the level of our oppressors.” A version of this article appears in print on April 4, 2018, on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Killing Led, at Last,  To Gun Restrictions.

National,317," Supported by By Julie Turkewitz DENVER — It’s been 19 years since a pair of student gunmen killed 13 people at Columbine High School in Colorado, thrusting the nation into sorrow and disbelief. Many in the area will spend the day as they have in years past: visiting a memorial carved into a hillside by the high school, its red rocks split by the words “Never Forgotten.” But the memorial only came about after years of community work that included both financial struggles and occasional conflict. Baked into the process was a series of questions: Is this a space for education or healing? Should the memorial explain the crime, mention the killers? Can a landscape — or a monument or garden — possibly convey the depth of a tragedy? As families in Parkland, Fla., face similar quandaries, we examine how three communities torn by school shootings have remembered the dead. More than 200 doves flew over Clement Park on the day the Columbine community unveiled its memorial to the 12 students and one teacher who died during an attack at the Colorado school on April 20, 1999. It had been almost a decade since the shooting, and the memorial was a circular expanse cut into a hillside next to the school. An outer wall formed the “Ring of Healing,” and an inner wall formed the “Ring of Remembrance.” Parents, classmates and teachers had submitted messages for the walls. “The hardest part to understand,” wrote one student, “is kids killing kids.” The memorial followed years of challenges. In the days after the shooting, an Illinois man erected an initial tribute, placing 15 crosses atop a hill to recall the 13 victims and two student killers. A father of one of the dead students soon ripped out two of the crosses, and for months a debate raged about the appropriate way to recall the assailants. A committee that had formed to create a permanent memorial eventually decided to avoid mention of the gunmen. It also agreed that the memorial should be separate from the scene of the attack. “We did not want the memorial on school grounds,” said Frank DeAngelis, who was Columbine’s principal the year of the attack. “If you do that at school it disrupts the educational process.” Today, the memorial is a “place of hope,” Mr. DeAngelis said. But paying for it was and continues to be a challenge. Fund-raisers found it difficult to meet their $1.5 million goal to build it. Even now, the Columbine Memorial Foundation struggles to find the $15,000 or so that it costs to maintain the park each year. Which is why Rick Townsend, the foundation’s president, is hoping to establish an endowment for the space. His daughter Lauren, 18, was killed in the shooting. “We don’t want it to be forgotten,” he said. Students began to gather on a field at Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007, just hours after a gunman killed 32 people on campus. By morning, stones had been laid there in an arc, one for each of the dead. They were made of Hokie Stone, limestone typical to the region that had been pilfered from a nearby construction site. It took only a short time for the university to recreate the arc in a permanent memorial on campus. New stones, each weighing 300 pounds, were laid, polished and etched with the names of the victims. The school unveiled the memorial on Aug. 19, 2007, along with a plaque: “We will prevail.” Twenty children and six adults died in the Dec. 14, 2012, attack at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. Now the community plans to build a memorial on an expanse of open meadow, ponds and sparsely wooded land. Unlike the privately funded Columbine memorial, this one will be paid for by the local government. A group called the Sandy Hook Permanent Memorial Commission is leading the effort to build it. The commission has sought out expertise from others who have experienced attacks, including Mr. DeAngelis. Many disparate memorials popped up in the weeks after the shooting, but the commission decided early on that the town needed a central place to heal, “rather than reminders all over the community,” said Dan Rosenthal, Newtown’s first selectman. A call for design submissions led to 188 ideas from around the world, including one with a plant selection that ensures vibrant colors in each season to “honor the warmth and joy the victims lived.” The commission has narrowed the field to 13 of those ideas. Eventually it will make a recommendation to Newtown’s government, which will consider local feedback before it signs off on the final design. “At the core of our design,” reads one submission, “is the notion that the earth has the inexplicable ability to hold us and cradle our sorrows.”         Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS",2018-04-20,0.0022639188,Friday
National,318," By MITCH SMITHMARCH 2, 2018 A gunman fatally shot two people at a Central Michigan University residence hall on Friday morning, sending police officers swarming to the campus and setting off a search for the suspect that ended early Saturday with an arrest. The episode rattled nerves at Central Michigan, where details were released slowly and students were told to take shelter inside dorms and classrooms for much of the day. Police officers said Friday that they were seeking James E. Davis Jr., 19 and a sophomore. They described him as a person of interest in the shooting and cautioned that he was “armed and dangerous.” The victims were identified as Mr. Davis’s parents, James E. Davis Sr. and Diva J. Davis, both 47. An Illinois state legislator identified the elder Mr. Davis as a police officer in Bellwood, a Chicago suburb. 
            The shooting at Central Michigan University today strikes close to home. A sad day in Bellwood and across the 7th District. My sincerest condolences go out to the family of Bellwood Police Officer James Davis Sr. and his wife who were shot and killed this morning. May they RIP. pic.twitter.com/B0cykAxFVv         Just before 1 a.m. Saturday, the university said the police had taken “the suspect in the shooting” into custody after a search that grew to include more than 100 police officers from several Michigan agencies and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.  The university did not name the suspect in its brief statement, saying only that the person had been “seen and reported by an individual on a train passing through the north end of campus shortly after midnight.”  “Law enforcement personnel responded and arrested the suspect without incident,” the statement said. The shooting came just over two weeks after 17 people were killed at a high school in Parkland, Fla., and amid a national conversation about gun control and gun rights. Near Central Michigan’s campus in Mount Pleasant, about 150 miles northwest of Detroit, public buildings and schools were placed on lockdown. 
            The person of interest is James Eric Davis, Jr. He is a black male, approximately 19 years of age, 5'10"" & 135 lbs. He was last see wearing mustard yellow jeans and a blue hoodie. The suspect is considered armed and dangerous. Do not approach the suspect. Call 911 immediately. pic.twitter.com/dCChxe1Tfr         
            ‼️The suspect is still at-large. For those in Mt. Pleasant and on CMU campus, as night approaches, stay inside and please stay safe.‼️         Lt. Larry Klaus of the university police, said Friday that the younger Mr. Davis had been taken to a hospital by the police on Thursday evening for what “officers believed might be a drug-related” incident, perhaps an overdose or a bad reaction to narcotics. Lieutenant Klaus said officers had found clothing alongside railroad tracks that may have been discarded by Mr. Davis. The hunt for Mr. Davis and the lengthy lockdown complicated the beginning of spring break at Central Michigan and led to the postponement of a men’s basketball game. The game was later rescheduled for Saturday morning, but will be closed to the public. More than six hours after the shooting, police officers went building to building to evacuate students. Parents who arrived to pick up their students were initially told to wait at a hotel. As the search continued, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan spoke alongside university leaders, promising assistance for students rattled by the shooting. “We had two people that were killed in a residence facility: that’s traumatic,” said Mr. Snyder, a Republican. “I hope everyone can rally and, to the degree you see something, say something.” Matt Stevens contributed reporting.

Business,319," By JACK NICASAPRIL 1, 2018 SAN FRANCISCO — Ryan Knight, a Democratic activist in Los Angeles, called for a boycott of Apple in February because it hadn’t responded to calls to delete a channel from the National Rifle Association from its streaming-video service after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting. “Dear @Apple,” Mr. Knight wrote on Twitter. “Your silence is deafening. #BoycottApple.” More than 330 accounts retweeted the message. How did Mr. Knight post the message? He used an iPhone. As the reach and influence of Silicon Valley’s tech giants have increased, so have the calls to boycott their products and services. The problem is that pulling off a boycott is not exactly easy: The tech companies’ products are so pervasive that they are difficult to avoid. That issue was crystallized in recent weeks with Facebook. Hundreds of people deleted their accounts after revelations that the political-data firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users. Yet many of those same people promptly instructed their friends to find them on Instagram, which is owned by — you guessed it — Facebook.  “It’s exactly the same company. I realize it’s ridiculous,” said Sachi Cunningham, a documentary filmmaker in San Francisco who deactivated her Facebook last week and shifted her attention to Instagram, where, she said, the conversation is less toxic.  Ms. Cunningham, who has freelanced for The New York Times, added that she had immediately begun missing Facebook as a research tool for her documentaries. “I don’t know if I can get out of the ecosystem,” she said. People looking to punish major tech companies by abstaining from their products have been bedeviled time and again by the difficulty in escaping them. After Google fired an engineer, James Damore, for criticizing the company’s diversity efforts last year, hundreds of people on social media called for a boycott of the company. But an analysis of nearly 7,000 tweets using the hashtag #BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google’s Android software, according to Keyhole, a social-media research firm. One Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug. 8: “Google’s firing of James Damore proves his point completely. I will no longer be using Google for any services. #BoycottGoogle.” The tweet came from an Android device. A message to the account went unreturned. 
            Google's firing of James Damore proves his point completely. I will no longer be using Google for any services.#BoycottGoogle         Even Breitbart is running into the same dilemma. The conservative website is planning to host a panel on how tech platforms like Facebook suppress conservative voices — and it said it would livestream the discussion on Facebook. Breitbart didn’t respond to a request for comment. Marisa Richardson, a program manager at a life-sciences company, said she began boycotting Amazon recently after learning that it offered the NRA channel on its streaming-video service. So when she needed laundry detergent, she avoided the e-commerce site and instead braved the crowds and traffic — and spent a few dollars more — at a nearby Target. But a few days later she shopped at the Whole Foods near her home in Oakland, Calif. “I completely forgot that they’re owned by Amazon,” she said. After the shooting in Parkland in February, gun-control activists called for a boycott of certain Apple and Amazon services because they hosted the NRA channel. People used the hashtag #March1NRABoycott to spread the message on social media. An analysis of about 58,500 tweets with the hashtag showed that nearly half came from an iPhone or an iPad, according to Keyhole. Those included popular tweets using the #March1NRABoycott hashtag from the actress Alyssa Milano. 
            TODAY#march1NRABoycott https://t.co/YtIMtAVL99         “Had I sent the same tweets from an Android phone, the same issue would apply. There is an NRATV app for Android phones,” Ms. Milano said through a spokeswoman. “We are only just beginning to understand how these companies have infiltrated not only our ideologies, but also our lives in the most in-depth way imaginable.”  Nearly a third of the 4,700 tweets using the #BoycottApple hashtag since August came from iPhones, according to Keyhole. “I do have an iPhone, but as a customer of Apple’s, am I not allowed to hold them accountable?” Mr. Knight, the activist who used an iPhone to call for an Apple boycott, said in an interview.      Eddy Cue, a senior executive at Apple, recently said that the NRA channel didn’t violate the company’s policies. Facebook, Google and Amazon didn’t respond to requests for comment. Many of those who recently abandoned their Facebook accounts are still in the company’s orbit, not only with Instagram but also with the company’s popular messaging apps WhatsApp and Messenger. When Cher recently deleted her Facebook page, she said on Twitter, “2day I did something VERY HARD 4 me.” But her Instagram account, with 768,000 followers, was still active. Likewise, Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, deleted the Facebook pages of both companies — but left their pages and his personal account active on Instagram. The photo-sharing platform, he said on Twitter, is fine “so long as it stays fairly independent.” 
            Instagram’s probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. I don’t use FB & never have, so don’t think I’m some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we don’t advertise or pay for endorsements, so … don’t care.         Stephen Cox, 39, a woodworker in Los Angeles, recently posted on Facebook that he was deactivating his account in favor of Instagram. When someone commented that the two sites were owned by the same company, he replied, “It’s a double-edged sword, but for me one edge is slightly more blunt than the other.”  Instagram has proved an effective hedge for Facebook against people losing interest or trust in its main site. While the percentage of American adults who use Facebook has remained flat at 68 percent since 2016, according to a January survey of 2,002 American adults by the Pew Research Center, Instagram use rose to 35 percent from 28 percent over that period. Instagram is also more popular with younger people than older people, according to the survey. Rayven Bruzzese, 26, a sign-language student in Philadelphia, said she had been a frequent user of Facebook for years but deleted her account in March because she found it upsetting and a drain on her time. Now she spends her time on Instagram. While she acknowledged the irony of moving to another Facebook-owned service, she said her options were limited. Few of her friends are on Twitter, and many have stopped using Snapchat. “Where am I supposed to go?” she said. “I wish there was something else.” Follow Jack Nicas on Twitter: @jacknicas.

Opinion,320," Supported by By Andrew Rosenthal As I watched President Trump blathering to a group of governors on Monday about throwing people who have not committed a crime into mental hospitals to prevent mass shootings at schools, I recalled a country where I once lived in which the government had that power — the Soviet Union. From the mid-1960s until the fall of Soviet Communism, the Kremlin employed the notion of “sluggish schizophrenia” — dreamed up by the Mengele-like psychiatrist Andrei Snezhnevsky — to imprison people on the ground that they were on their way to becoming insane. Rejected by most civilized nations as a transparent fraud, sluggish schizophrenia was used against dissidents and other citizens who simply dared to seek exit visas. When I worked in Moscow as a reporter in the mid-1980s, I knew an Estonian man who was committed twice for refusing to enter the Red Army during the war in Afghanistan, an act of sanity. It was a literal Catch-22. Now comes Trump, urging the nation’s governors to return to a time when he said the states could “nab” people and throw them in a padded room because “something was off.” In fact, the law has required court-ratified findings of actual mental illness for involuntary commitment since around 1881, said Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor at Columbia University’s medical school. “It was never the case that people could be involuntary committed for being a little odd, or even for that matter thought to be dangerous to other people unless they had evidence of mental illness,” he said. I’m not bringing this up to suggest that Trump is a disciple of Snezhnevsky, despite his bizarre affinity for Kremlin autocracy, or merely to point out that the president was once again making things up. Rather, it is an example of the incoherent, insincere and inadequate ways in which the president and others on the right are suddenly claiming to be dedicated to addressing the nation’s epidemic of gun violence. They are playing a cynical game of misdirection. It is tragic that in recent decades, states have closed mental hospitals and thrown people into prisons when they should be receiving psychiatric care. But that has little to do with gun violence — in or out of schools, on a small or mass scale. The gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety studied 133 acts of mass murder committed between January 2009 and July 2015 and found that only one of the murderers had been “prohibited by federal law from possessing guns due to severe mental illness.” In only 11 percent of the cases did the group find “evidence that concerns about the mental health of the shooter had been brought to the attention of a medical practitioner, school official or legal authority.” Similarly, the president’s newfound support for banning bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic weapons to be fired nearly as rapidly as automatic ones, is fine, on the surface. But bump stocks could have been banned at any time before or since a killer used them to murder 58 people in Las Vegas last fall, and Trump has done nothing to make it happen. Some politicians — so far not including Trump or the Republican leadership in Congress — are calling for raising the age to buy a semiautomatic weapon to 21 from 18. (The person charged with the murders in Parkland, Fla., this month was 19.) There should be such a law, on a national basis and not state by state, but Everytown found that only 5 percent of the mass shooters it studied were under 20. And of course, mass shooting victims account for a tiny percentage of the Americans gunned down every year. A majority of children killed by guns are killed by accident, or by their own hand, or by adults, with weapons legally obtained by adults. Trump also chimed in on calls from the right to arm more teachers and train them to shoot would-be killers. It’s an absurd and dangerous idea. Highly trained police officers frequently miss their targets, even at close range, in the heat of the moment. Having armed civilians at a shooting scene would just make their jobs harder. The real problem with gun violence is not about mental hospitals, armed teachers, bump stocks or age requirements. The real problem is that there are far too many firearms in America — more than 300 million, according to Congress. They are too easy to obtain and they are becoming ever more lethal. But the gun lobby, led by the National Rifle Association, has stopped every effort to reduce the number and lethality of firearms, a crusade that seems as much or more about expanding the markets for firearms makers than about constitutional principles. Banning the possession of semiautomatic weapons by civilians would be a better approach. So would repealing lax concealed-carry laws, stand-your-ground laws and other rules that are proliferating around America to make it easier to shoot someone and get away with it. The risk is that the passage of a few partial measures will take our eyes off the bigger picture and drain the energy out of the demands for change led by young people after the Parkland slaughter. That is what the gun lobby is counting on. I invite you to join me on Facebook.

Opinion,321," Supported by By Frank Bruni The president wants a parade, but not some girlie, frilly procession that limits itself to high-stepping musicians, high-reaching headdresses, flutes and floats. He wants muscle. Metal. He wants tanks and soldiers and planes. In his Veterans Day vision, Pennsylvania Avenue bulges with artillery, because in his blinkered view, that’s the measure of a nation’s worth. It’s also the affirmation of his potency. The president wants us to know that if he’d been outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., when the shooting began, “I’d run in there even if I didn’t have a weapon.” Can there be any doubt? If Donald Trump is known for one thing, it’s fearlessness. Selflessness comes in a close second. Ronald Reagan starred as a cowboy in Hollywood westerns. George W. Bush strode across the deck of an aircraft carrier in an olive flight suit and an ejection harness to declare — prematurely — that a mission had been accomplished. But I’m not sure that any president over the past half century was as perversely insistent on his manhood, as narrow in his definition of it and as superficially fixated on brute strength as the Oval Office’s current occupant is. What a shame, because we’re struggling right now to forge a healthier sexual dynamic between men and women and to stop young men from exploding violently. We sorely need a better and more nuanced model of masculinity. Instead we have Trump, the “Access Hollywood” president, whose message is that real men fetishize weapons, glorify brutality, degrade their adversaries and grope the objects of their affection. He’s not angling to be a parade marshal. He’s adamant about a martial parade. On the brutality front, Jonathan Swan of the website Axios recently reported that Trump has a private obsession with capital punishment for those who push drugs and a desire to emulate countries less concerned with due process than ours. “He often jokes about killing drug dealers,” a senior administration official told Swan. “He’ll say: ‘You know the Chinese and Filipinos don’t have a drug problem. They just kill them.’” For Trump, toughness obviates restraint. It precludes mercy. It isn’t calibrated but it has a caliber, because toughness means packing heat. Just as striking as his call to arm some teachers — “only the best,” he tweeted — is his inflated estimate of how many of them are adept with firearms and his romanticizing of that group. He said that if a Parkland football coach who died while shielding students had been carrying a gun, “he would have shot and that would have been the end of it.” That’s a huge leap, but for the president, contact sports and marksmanship are of a manly piece. Responsible Americans are calling for more safety in football. Trump advocates the hardest possible hits. In the wake of disasters natural and man-made, he lavishes his words on the rescuers, the police officers, the paramedics. They deserve every syllable, but he sometimes shortchanges the victims. It’s action that interests him, not vulnerability, and he made that clear long ago, with his casual dismissal of American prisoners of war. “I like people that weren’t captured,” he said, in answer to a question about Senator John McCain. He elevates coal miners over computer pioneers. Real men have dirt or dust under the nails. His are neat and clean. “He’s the opposite of a tough guy,” his biographer Michael D’Antonio said. “He’s a frightened guy. A tough guy wouldn’t have to demonstrate it.” I asked a renowned psychiatrist about the way that Trump surrounds himself with military generals and moons over authoritarian leaders. He noted that boys between the ages of 6 and 10 “get fascinated with Superman and all these powerful figures because of their own puniness.” Perhaps some 71-year-old billionaires do likewise. But I’m less concerned with Trump’s insecurities than with his example. D’Antonio told me: “This is masculinity by way of 1950s comics and 1960s Playboy magazines. It’s a cartoon.” And it’s dangerous, as two compelling essays in The Times recently suggested. Reflecting on the troubled young men behind our country’s mass shootings, Michael Ian Black wrote that many boys are trapped in an idea of manhood “where there is no way to be vulnerable without being emasculated, where manliness is about having power over others.” Trump sets that very trap. Examining why men sexually abuse and harass women, Moises Velasquez-Manoff observed that for many of them, “It is precisely the power imbalance that’s erotic.” Doesn’t that sound true of Trump? He taunts (“Liddle Marco”). He bullies (“Lock her up”). He struts. He thrills to violence — at least from a distance. All of this has nothing to do with strength, and it’s less paradigm of masculinity than pantomime of it. What would Donald do? We should tell our sons, grandsons and nephews to figure that out, focus on it — and then take the opposite tack. I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@FrankBruni) and join me on Facebook.

Opinion,322," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Bethany Mandel A few months after my father left our family home for good, my mother heard me screaming in the middle of the night. It was the kind of scream that made her grab her rifle in one hand and some ammo in another. It was a spring night and I was sleeping with my window open, which was right above my bed; I loved breathing in the fresh air. That night, in that open window, I heard the banging of a ladder, and by the time my mother made it into the room and began loading her gun, a man was about to climb in. She said something along the lines of: “Bethany, come over here. I don’t want you to get his brain matter on your face.” I backed up behind her and my mother raised her gun. The would-be intruder slowly backed down the ladder. As he climbed down, my mother approached. The barrel of her rifle was inches away from his face and she told him, “Next time you come here, I won’t hesitate.” She had her gun pointed at him through the window on his way down, and as he went down the ladder she grabbed the top and shook it, just to put the fear of God into him one last time before he fled. My mother admired Ralph Nader and voted for the Green Party candidate during every presidential election I walked into a booth with her. There was not an issue on which she was not the most progressive person in the room. And yet, she owned guns. They weren’t “weapons of war” to us, nor were my parents “gun nuts”; they just had a camper trailer in upstate New York, where bears were common campfire intruders. And soon, she had reason to keep them around the house for self-defense as well. Right around when my dad left, when I was 3 years old, our neighborhood on Long Island experienced a crime wave of burglaries, which led my mother to keep guns in various parts of the house in case she needed one at a moment’s notice. That decision turned a story with a potentially tragic ending into one about a heroic single mother and her young daughter. Our incident won’t show up in the statistics about gun use in self-defense scenarios. I doubt my mother ever reported it to the police. While it may seem counterintuitive to those who didn’t grow up around guns, in our house we saw them as tools of protection and empowerment for two women living alone. After my first child, a daughter, was born I must have printed the paperwork required to obtain a gun permit in New Jersey a dozen times. Despite what many may think, the process is not simple nor is it quick, which led to my procrastinating for several years. Over the Republican primary season, I was an outspoken conservative critic of then-candidate Donald Trump, and a torrent of hate rolled my way. I would later learn just how much: The Anti-Defamation League named me one of the top 10 Jewish journalists to be attacked by the alt-right during the election season. After years of receiving death threats for my conservative views, months of being attacked by the alt-right and then having our address published online by the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer, I pushed myself to finally go through the process of asking friends for letters attesting to my character, obtaining fingerprints and submitting to background checks. I was given a reason to feel that I needed to defend myself and my family. And I acted on it. In the wake of every mass shooting, there are renewed calls for gun control, and a demonization of the National Rifle Association (of which I was but am no longer a member). We are told that it’s not our guns — the guns of legal and responsible gun owners — that would be taken away, but those of the bad guys. But when those advocating bans don’t even understand the mechanics and basic terminology of guns, it doesn’t inspire confidence. All Americans should expect law enforcement agencies, which missed opportunities to stop not just the Parkland shooter, but also the shooters in the Charleston and Sutherland Springs churches and the Orlando nightclub, to be able to protect us. You can forgive conservatives if we don’t believe that giving federal law enforcement officials more authority is the solution to shootings they bear some responsibility for. That’s, in part, why many gun owners insist the answer isn’t a ban, but rather evaluating who can obtain these weapons. President Trump is now reportedly considering the idea of gun restraining orders, which have the ability to quickly take firearms away from those considered dangerous, like the shooter in Parkland. A variation of this law is already on the books in California. In 2016, 86 of these restraining orders were issued, and 10 were extended past the initial 21-day period they were granted for. Our side insists that people are the problem, not guns, and to make good on that we need to come to the table with ideas on how to keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous individuals who have no business holding them. This idea, popularized in a piece by National Review’s David French after the Parkland shooting, isn’t a panacea. But it is a middle ground for gun-rights supporters and gun-control activists to meet. Many supporters of the Second Amendment know something is broken, just as its opponents do, and ideas like Mr. French’s can bring many more to the negotiating table than calling for outright bans on guns or the notion that there are no legislative solutions to the gun violence issue. But such a compromise will require gun-control activists to confront the lie of one of their favorite talking points: that gun-rights supporters care more about guns than children. For many, support for gun rights is motivated precisely by our devotion to protecting our kids. Bethany Mandel (@bethanyshondark) is an editor at Ricochet and a columnist at The Forward.

Opinion,323," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Nathan Englander Mr. Englander is a novelist who lives in Brooklyn. There is a white tree outside my window, with a pretty black bird on it. I don’t know the name of the tree. What I do know is that in spring, it blooms. Or, at least it bloomed this year. A few hours after I admired it, a freezing, torrential downpour battered the newly flowered branches. A few days before, I woke up to discover not a white tree but a white world, as a springtime blizzard bore down on New York. Thankfully, between those two storms was a beautiful Saturday — a full 30 degrees warmer than the day that followed. My wife and I took our daughter to Prospect Park in Brooklyn for a kid’s birthday party, where we found the rest of our borough out in force. The three of us maneuvered between charity walkers and horseback riders, and the racing bicyclists who seemed intent on flattening anyone in their way. I soon learned that not far from where we were hanging out, David Buckel, a 60-year-old civil rights lawyer and environmentalist, had self-immolated earlier that same morning. He’d doused himself in fossil fuel to protest fossil fuel use, after leaving a suicide note nearby and emailing a copy to this newspaper. I was shocked, then saddened. Within a few hours of that harrowing suicide, the park had already moved on. The city, with the rest of the world, never stopped. At home I looked online to see how this man’s desperate act, taken with the express purpose of drawing attention, was being presented in our click-based media landscape. His tortured message was there, but it was already being drowned out by other news, particularly the deafening noise from the president’s porn star feud. It occurred to me that Mr. Buckel didn’t have the banner headlines because what he did was so un-American. I don’t mean in the patriotic sense. I mean in style and form. The extraordinarily painful way he took his life reminded me more of the Tibetans who have sacrificed their lives protesting Chinese rule. And then I read that Mr. Buckel had himself alluded to Tibetan monks in his note. How do Americans kill themselves when they want to get attention? Just look at gun-related massacre after massacre, in which legally armed monsters take the lives of innocents, ensuring they get every front page and top-of-the-hour story, before turning the guns on themselves. In Parkland, Fla., in Las Vegas, and on and on. And so their messages of nihilism, of pure evil, spread. Whatever underlying depression or personal issues drove David Buckel to do what he did, he, too, had a message. He wrote in his suicide note: “Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result — my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.” And to share this message, he burned himself in Brooklyn. He did it early in the morning, when few would see, and no one would film it, limiting the AR-15-level attention that we give the very worst among us. Looking at the white tree, I can’t tell you how climate really affects my day-to-day life, beyond some canceled flights. A couple of years ago, however, I saw its ravages. In 2016, my family lived in Zomba, Malawi. Outside our window there was a green tree that, one morning, was suddenly covered with mangoes. For so many in the districts around Zomba that year, mango trees were a lifeline, the fruits boiled hard and green to keep the children from starving. Because that year had been climate change-dry, and the year before there were floods, and now there was hunger. Most people around Zomba don’t drive cars, or throw out plastic, or have refrigerators to run, even when there’s electricity to run them. What they do have is religion. And the most religious Christians I have ever met — so few of whom had access to quality education, to climate data or weather.com — told me without pause, or conflict with their deep faith, that global warming had destroyed their crops. They did not say it with anger toward me, an American, who lives in the place that generates the pollution that sends the bad weather their way. It was just a fact of life — and death. For them, climate change wasn’t a looming threat. It was a real emergency for them and their children, an emergency that seemed personally and deadly urgent to David Buckel, too, on a Saturday in Brooklyn, where the line at the ice cream shop ran around the block, and where our corner cafe was caught off guard by the sunshine so that the only shortage I heard about was of $5 iced coffees. Maybe David Buckel’s suicide didn’t reach our part of the park, and maybe the harvests of Zomba don’t concern a president whose food comes from McDonald’s. But if we can give our newspapers over to gun-toting maniacs for days on end, maybe we should make a little more room for this. Sad as Mr. Buckel’s death is, as uninspiring as it should be to others, if he set himself aflame to send a message, and it’s impossible to unburn him, and too late to direct his energies another way, the least we can do is spread the word.

None,324," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 18, 2018, 1:07 A.M. E.D.T. CHEYENNE, Wyo. —  The Wyoming school district where U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos suggested that teachers might need to be armed to protect children from grizzly bears voted Tuesday on doing just that, though concerns about school shootings worry parents more than the possibility of big bruins on the prowl. The 4-2 vote by the Park County School District No. 6 board in the town of Cody near Yellowstone National Park came after more than six months of discussion and debate. Under the proposed policy, school employees would need to have at least 24 hours of initial firearms training and annual recertification to carry concealed guns at school. ""Unfortunately we have people in our country who want to cause harm to students and at some point you have to respond to that threat. And that's what this board decided to do with the policy they adopted,"" said Superintendent Ray Schulte. The policy was up for a final vote after passing two earlier votes 5-2. Nationwide, some districts are discussing arming teachers not with guns but buckets of rocks (Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania) and tiny baseball bats (Erie, Pennsylvania). But in some rural areas including much of Texas, school officials have been quietly arming teachers for years.  A February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killed 17 people but didn't really change minds in northwest Wyoming about whether to arm teachers, parents said.  ""I think people are really entrenched,"" said Yancy Bonner, an opponent of arming teachers who said she may remove her fifth-grade daughter from the school district. In January 2017, DeVos said during her confirmation hearings that elementary school teachers in Wapiti, a small community about a half-hour drive from Cody where DeVos' family owns land, might already be armed against grizzlies. They weren't — and the remark drew widespread ridicule despite being rooted in a measure of fact. Grizzlies descend from the Absaroka Range into Wapiti and other areas near Cody in search of habitat and food. A tall fence surrounds the Wapiti school grounds to keep bears out. DeVos' comments did not come up during Tuesday night's discussion, according to a reporter for The Cody Enterprise. ""It doesn't have anything to do with grizzly bears,"" Schulte said. ""It has to do with the Wyoming Legislature."" The Wyoming Legislature, which passes gun-friendly legislation almost every year, passed a bill in 2017 letting school districts decide whether to allow teachers and other employees to carry concealed weapons. Republican Gov. Matt Mead signed the bill into law and schools in the city of Evanston in March become Wyoming's first to allow armed teachers. Tuesday's vote happened in Park County, which has one of the biggest gun museums in the U.S. and plenty of hunters, outfitters, ranchers and libertarians who like guns.      ""We have a right to conceal carry in this state. And I think people should exercise their rights,"" said Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, a former California police officer with two children attending a private school in Cody. ""Whether it's Walmart or a school building, if you conceal carry you conceal carry — you have a permit to do so.""  The policy passed Tuesday night does not allow all concealed carry permit holders to bring weapons onto school grounds. ""The board here kept very tight control of the process and they're not just extending this authorization to carry to just anybody,"" Schulte said. ""There are all kinds of requirements people have to meet, and only if they meet them would they be approved to carry a weapon on school property."" Proponents of guns for teachers in schools say it can take too long for police or sheriff's deputies to respond to a shooter or any other disturbance at a rural school. ""But regardless of distance or the police response, if you have somebody there that's willing to stop a lethal threat using lethal means, then that's great,"" said Rodriguez-Williams. Bonner said she's not opposed to allowing guns in remote schools, but worries that teachers shooting back at perceived threats could do more harm than good. ""I'm not anti-gun. I mean, we hunt — my whole family hunts. We have guns in our house. I just feel that there are better ways to keep our teachers safe,"" Bonner said. Another Wyoming school district about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from Cody in the city of Powell voted recently to study a range of possible new safety measures up to and including arming teachers. But firearms for teachers are not the main focus, said Superintendent Jay Curtis. ""They're not off the table at this point, but I don't think anyone in Powell — at least not on the board or the administration — believes concealed carry is the answer,"" Curtis said. ___ ___ This story has been updated to correct the name of the North Fork of the Shoshone River.

NYTNow,325," By CHRIS STANFORDMARCH 30, 2018  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • With the dispute over the attack on a former Russian spy in Britain, tensions between Moscow and the West are at their highest in decades. On Thursday, the Kremlin announced that it would expel 60 American diplomats and close the U.S. Consulate in St. Petersburg, after the U.S., European countries and others announced coordinated expulsions of Russian diplomats. President Trump didn’t address the expulsions, but the White House said in a statement, “Russia’s response was not unanticipated, and the United States will deal with it.” • The daughter of the former spy, who was also poisoned with a nerve agent, is no longer in critical condition.  • David Pecker, the publisher of The National Enquirer, and President Trump are old friends. Mr. Pecker showcased that connection during a dinner at the White House last year, as he was seeking to expand his business interests into Saudi Arabia.  The tabloid publisher’s relationship with the Saudis, enhanced by the White House visit, is a previously untold chapter in the long, symbiotic relationship between the president and the publisher. • Mr. Pecker has long used his media empire to protect Mr. Trump’s image, including suppressing the story of an alleged affair with a Playboy model. We looked at that and other examples. • Car manufacturers are set to receive a gift from an unusual source: the Environmental Protection Agency. The head of the agency, Scott Pruitt, has sent the White House a draft of a plan to weaken fuel efficiency standards. The E.P.A. is expected to frame the initiative as eliminating a regulatory burden, resulting in more affordable vehicles. • Our reporters note: “The move — which undercuts one of former President Barack Obama’s signature efforts to fight climate change — would also propel the Trump administration toward a courtroom clash with California, which has vowed to stick with the stricter rules even if Washington rolls back federal standards.” • Violence broke out today along Gaza’s border with Israel as Palestinians set up tent cities and began a six-week protest campaign. Soon after the demonstration began, the Israeli military reported that thousands of Palestinians were rioting in six locations along the border. At least twelve Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire and more than 1,000 injured, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said.  • Organizers had called for a peaceful protest of Israel’s longtime blockade of Gaza, which restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of the coastal territory. Israel says the measure is a security imperative. • It has been two years since the European Union struck a deal with Turkey in an effort to cut the flow of asylum seekers across the Aegean. Many were fleeing wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. But thousands of migrants remain on the Greek island of Lesbos, unwilling to return home and unable to move toward the opportunity they hoped to find in Europe. • We visited some refugee camps, which one resident, who has experienced war, described as “a very dangerous place.” Behind the Supreme Court ruling of Brown v. Board of Education was a girl whose story led to states being ordered to desegregate schools. • Silicon Valley’s relationship with the White House is shifting as tech companies find some common ground. The relationship isn’t entirely rosy, however, as President Trump criticized Amazon on Thursday, saying the online retailer doesn’t pay enough taxes. We checked the facts. • ABC realized after President Trump’s victory in 2016 that it was leaving some viewers behind. The return of “Roseanne” is part of the network’s strategy to get them back. • Tesla looked like the future. Now some are asking if it has one. The electric-car maker announced a recall of 123,000 vehicles on Thursday, and its credit rating was downgraded this week.  • The Fox News host Laura Ingraham  apologized for taunting a survivor of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. The student, David Hogg, had called for a boycott by advertisers. • U.S. stocks were up on Thursday. Most global markets, including those in the U.S., are closed today for Good Friday. Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • Here’s why driving less may not save much on your auto insurance. • Use these tips to throw a healthy and relaxed dinner party. • Recipe of the day: End the week with a quick, delicious dinner of pan-roasted salmon with jalapeño. Our journalists recommend these great pieces: “I just joined The Times, but I have to give a shout-out to my former colleague at the veterans site I co-founded a few years ago. Ever wonder what happened to Paul Bremer, the fall guy for the Iraq War? He traded in his nation-building skills for ski poles. For the 15th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, Aaron Gell tracked him down him at the Okemo Mountain Resort, where he’s an instructor.” [Task & Purpose] — Lauren Katzenberg, editor, At War “This is a dazzling look at Tiffany Haddish, a rising star and a brilliant comedian coming into her own. And she has a killer Beyoncé anecdote.” [GQ] — Jenna Wortham, staff writer, Times Magazine • A new trial for “Serial” figure Adnan Syed, whose case was chronicled in the first season of the hit podcast “Serial,” should be granted a new trial, an appeals panel ruled on Thursday.  Mr. Syed was convicted in 2000 of the first-degree murder and kidnapping of his former girlfriend. • Not to worry The threat from an abandoned Chinese space station that is scheduled to crash back to Earth this weekend is almost nonexistent. The risk is “significantly smaller than being hit by lightning,” one analyst said. • Quiz time! Did you keep up with this week’s news? Test yourself. • Ready for the weekend At the movies, our critic reviewed Steven Spielberg’s “Ready Player One,” an adaptation of the 2011 best seller about a virtual video-game reality.

I am prioritizing this over college right now, I am prioritizing people’s lives over my education.” — Samantha Fuentes, who was wounded in the school shooting last month in Parkland, Fla., on whether to go to college in the fall or continue fighting for gun-safety laws. • The Times, in other words Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. Last weekend, young people across the U.S. seized the nation’s attention with the March for Our Lives, vowing that their grief about school shootings and their frustration with inaction would power a new generation of activism. It wasn’t the first time students turned into activists and demanded attention. On May 2, 1963, teenagers and children marched in Birmingham, Ala., against segregation. The police arrested many of them for parading without a permit and sent them to jail. Officers also turned fire hoses on the protesting children. It didn’t deter them. The marches, known as the Birmingham Children’s Crusade, continued for days. The children-led protests in 1963 were part of the Birmingham Campaign, a series of civil rights protests led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The children’s protest helped turn the nation’s attention to Jim Crow laws and segregation in the South and served as a turning point of the movement. A month later, President John F. Kennedy called for a bill that would later become the 1964 Civil Rights Act. “Can you imagine?” one of the protesters from 1963 told NPR last week, “here we are in 2018, and we’re still reliving some of this stuff.”  Claire Moses contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

Express,326," By MATTHEW HAAGAPRIL 17, 2018 Three parents whose children were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 filed a defamation lawsuit on Tuesday against Alex Jones, the right-wing conspiracy theorist who has long claimed the shooting was “completely fake” and a “giant hoax” perpetrated by opponents of the Second Amendment. Mr. Jones, the popular radio show host who also operates the conspiracy theory website Infowars, has questioned for years whether 20 children and six adults died in the school massacre in Newtown, Conn. To bolster his false claims, he often cites news reports and video clips from the hours after the shooting that turned out to be incomplete or based on wrong information. Soon after they buried their children, many Sandy Hook parents started to come under fierce attack by conspiracy theorists who have said they are actors in an elaborate scheme to enact stricter gun control laws. The fringe theories still thrive in small forums online but have reached a far greater audience through Mr. Jones, the most vocal propagator. The two lawsuits filed on Tuesday represent the first civil action taken by parents accusing Mr. Jones of defamation. One was filed by Leonard Pozner and his former wife, Veronique De La Rosa, and the other was filed by Neil Heslin. Their sons, Noah Pozner and Jesse Heslin, both 6, were killed at Sandy Hook.  The suits focus on comments made by Mr. Jones in the past year. In a segment on his radio show called “Sandy Hook Vampires Exposed,” which aired on April 22, 2017, Mr. Jones highlighted an interview that Ms. De La Rosa did with Anderson Cooper of CNN after the shooting. While they are standing outside a downtown Newtown building, Mr. Cooper turns his head to face her.  During that quick head movement, Mr. Cooper’s nose seems to disappear — evidence, Mr. Jones said, that the interview with Ms. De La Rosa was conducted in a studio. In reality, the glitch is known as a compression artifact, a distortion that is common in video encoding. Mr. Jones suggests it means they are both actors. “When he turns, his nose disappears repeatedly because the green screen isn’t set right,” he said. A few months later, in June, Mr. Jones was profiled on NBC’s “Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly,” which brought up his past comments about Sandy Hook. Ms. Kelly also interviewed Mr. Heslin, who recalled seeing his dead son. “I held my son with a bullet hole through his head,” Mr. Heslin told her. But a week later in an Infowars video, Owen Shroyer, who works for the site, argued that it was “not possible” that Mr. Heslin held his dead son because the medical examiner said he showed photographs to the parents to identify their children. “Will there be a clarification from Heslin or Megyn Kelly?” Mr. Shroyer said. “I wouldn’t hold your breath.” The next month, Mr. Jones replayed part of that Infowars video on his show. “The stuff I found was they never let them see their bodies,” Mr. Jones said. “That’s kind of what’s weird about this. But maybe they did.” In a rambling 10-minute response published on Infowars on Tuesday, Mr. Jones said that his lawyers were very confident that the lawsuits were frivolous because his efforts to discuss both sides of the issue were misunderstood and misrepresented by major media outlets. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     “It is every American’s right to question any big event, especially when it’s seized on to take the basic liberties of Americans,” he said, referring to the Second Amendment.  Mr. Jones also said that the parents of the murdered children were victims being “roped into this” by Ms. Kelly and the media. “I’ve been telling the parents for years I believe their children died, and quite frankly, they know that,” he said. “I’m sorry they died, but I didn’t kill them and gun owners in American did not kill your children,” he continued. “I believe Sandy Hook happened.” Mr. Shroyer did not respond to an email seeking comment on Tuesday morning. Both lawsuits were filed in Travis County District Court in Austin, Tex., where Mr. Jones lives, broadcasts his show and operates Infowars. The parents are seeking at least $1 million in damages. “The statements were a continuation and elaboration of a yearslong campaign to falsely attack the honesty of the Sandy Hook parents, casting them as participants in a ghastly conspiracy and cover-up,” the parents’ lawsuits said. The parents are represented by Mark D. Bankston, a Houston lawyer who filed a similar defamation lawsuit this month against Mr. Jones and Infowars after they falsely identified a Massachusetts man as the gunman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Last June, a Florida woman who believes the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax was sentenced to five months in prison for making death threats against Mr. Pozner in voice mail messages and emails.

None,327," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 19, 2018, 5:32 P.M. E.D.T. PHOENIX —  The public education uprisings that began in West Virginia and spread to Arizona, Oklahoma and Kentucky share similar origin stories. Teachers, long tired of low wages and a dearth of state funding, begin talking to each other online. Their Facebook groups draw tens of thousands of members. They share stories of their frustrations and then they demand change. Kentucky public school employee Nema Brewer co-founded the KY120 United Facebook group that drew more than 40,000 members in a month. Teachers there are calling for more education funding, triggering actions that forced more than 30 schools to close last Friday. ""We had no idea it would light a fire under people,"" Brewer said. Educators communicating online played a key role in forming grassroots groups that are storming statehouses and holding demonstrations. It started in West Virginia, where two teachers set up a private Facebook page last fall that grew to 24,000 members. The group provided a private forum for educators to plot strategy, bolster resistance and plan demonstrations. After they went on strike and won a pay raise, educators elsewhere took notice.  Jennifer Grygiel, a communications and social media professor at Syracuse University, said people are increasingly realizing they can coordinate online for social causes, such as the #MeToo movement. Engaging online can also be a way for people to form their own identities, she said. ""It's where we congregate now.""  In Arizona, teachers formed a Facebook group called Arizona Educators United that now has more than 40,000 members. Co-founder Noah Karvelis said social media has been ""incredibly vital."" He said the first #RedforEd demonstration day was Twitter-driven. Most recently, the group used Facebook Live to share news of a planned vote on whether to strike in their quest for a 20-percent raise and more than $1 billion in new education funding. Voting started Tuesday after Gov. Doug Ducey has put forward a proposal to raise salaries 20 percent by 2020 and the voting was scheduled to end Thursday. The online genesis of the Arizona movement cropped up outside of organized labor. But Arizona Education Association President Joe Thomas said the union stands in solidary with the grassroots group. He spoke at a rally where Arizona Educators United unveiled their demands, joined them in a letter to Ducey asking for a meeting, and appeared in a video on the Facebook page. He called Arizona Educators United a ""breath of fresh air"" in the fight for higher education funding. ""It shares the same purpose, and that's why I think we can stand so easily next to each other,"" he said. ""I've said multiple times, 'I don't care who throws the touchdown, I want to win the game.'""      Tammy Custis has been acting as a site liaison for Arizona Educators at the school where she teaches in Peoria. In addition to staying tuned into the main Facebook group and a few other discussion pages, she's using communication apps to stay in touch with teachers at her school about organizing efforts so they don't have to use district resources. Online platforms have been key to staying connected, she said. ""It's amazing how engaged these already-so-busy-teachers are in this fight,"" she said. ""They are finding a way to get their teaching done, and still finding time to have a voice."" In Oklahoma, eighth-grade history teacher Alberto Morejon in early March founded the Facebook group supporting a teacher walk-out that's now being used by about 80,000 teachers. Morejon, who said he doesn't belong to a union, is continuing to push for new funding for public education.  ""We're going to keep showing up until they do something,"" he said. Once it started, the group grew quickly; within six hours of adding members to the newly created group, it had 17,000 members. ""I think it shows there's a problem, and it needs to be fixed,"" Morejon said. Beth Becker, a social media coach and strategist in progressive politics, said that social media is ""the great democratizer"" and thus a powerful organizing tool. ""It has given a voice to people who in the past didn't have a voice, because they didn't have that $1 million to buy a member of Congress with,"" she said. But online activism can't be the sole front, she said. Marches and demonstrations are still necessary to draw attention to a cause, Becker said, citing the Parkland, Florida, students becoming activists to change gun laws and spurring the March for Our Lives. ""You're not going to win just because of your social media or anything online, but you're not going to win without it,"" she said. ___ Additional reporting by Michael Virtanen and John Raby in West Virginia and Sean Murphy in Oklahoma.

Express,328," By NIRAJ CHOKSHIFEB. 24, 2018 After any major attack, you are likely to find in some dark corner of the internet conspiracy theories that the survivors or victims made it all up or were part of a troupe of paid “crisis actors.” Such theories emerged after the massacres in Las Vegas in October; at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., in 2016; and at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. It happened again in February, after 17 people were killed in the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Those conspiracy theories have been amplified in the internet age, but they are a part of a long, troubled history of dismissing the voices of those seeking change. “This theme that anyone agitating for change must be either an outside agitator or must have been paid or put up to it is one that runs throughout American history,” Kevin M. Kruse, a history professor at Princeton University, said in a phone interview.  Conspiracies of this kind quickly circulated about the Florida shooting, with one top-trending YouTube video suggesting, falsely, that one of the survivors was a hired actor. The video’s caption tapped into the idea that student protesters were paid to advocate gun control, and Mr. Kruse pointed his followers on Twitter to a decades-old analog: In 1957, civil rights supporters had to dispel rumors that nine black children seeking to integrate Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., were being paid for their activism. That strategy of dismissing protest as being funded or imported by outsiders was commonly used during the civil rights movement to minimize racial tension or brush aside genuine demands for equality.  “It’s a perennial theme of segregationists that this activism is not sincere, that it’s not Americans advocating for their own rights but rather it’s a scam,” Mr. Kruse said. In his 1963 “Letter From a Birmingham Jail” defending nonviolent civil disobedience, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. described the tactic as an effort to silence African-American voices. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     “If our white brothers dismiss as ‘rabble rousers’ and ‘outside agitators’ those of us who employ nonviolent direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies — a development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare,” Dr. King wrote. Politicians of that era often promoted the idea of the “outside agitator” to portray racial discord as isolated and exaggerated, but they hardly invented the strategy. Similar tactics were used in the years after the Civil War to minimize stories of the violence and discrimination faced by African-Americans, Heather Cox Richardson, a history professor at Boston College, said in a phone interview. As the nation began the process of postwar reunification, some in Congress invited testimony from African-Americans, offering them a per diem to cover travel costs and missed wages, she said. But those seeking to dismiss their stories of pain and demands for equality argued that the payments were proof that their accounts could not be trusted.  “You get this idea immediately after the war, during these testimonies, that people talking about civil rights are literally getting paid” to tell fabricated stories, Ms. Richardson said. That belief spread to other contexts, too. Testimony from African-Americans on the violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan, for example, was explained away as funded falsehoods. “They were attracted by a fee of two dollars per diem, and in many cases were evidently drilled for the occasion,” one politician said of the testimony, according to an 1871 news report. The accounts, he said, were “of the lowest kind and utterly unworthy of belief.” To Ms. Richardson, those early dismissals of African-American testimony, starting with the congressional hearings during the Reconstruction era, are not unlike the false theories spread about the Parkland school shooting suggesting that the student survivors were actors paid to protest for gun control. “That actually sounds very much like what you got in those first congressional hearings,” she said.

                        MARCH 26, 2018 On Saturday afternoon, as hundreds of thousands of people joined the March for Our Lives around the nation, I was on the phone with Michael Corbat, chief executive of Citigroup. Mr. Corbat had taken the remarkable step on Thursday of authorizing a new set of rules to restrict gun sales by Citi’s clients, the first time a Wall Street bank had used its position to influence the gun control debate. Five weeks earlier, a gunman’s attack at a high school in Parkland, Fla., had left 17 dead. Soon afterward, I wrote a column challenging the business world to “effectively set new rules for the sales of guns in America,” given Washington’s intransigence. Other companies soon acted — BlackRock and Dick’s Sporting Goods, among them — but Citi’s decision has the potential to serve as a template for others in the finance industry. Citi said it would require retailers to place restrictions on the sale of guns to anyone under the age of 21, to stop selling bump stocks and high-capacity magazines and to perform background checks. Otherwise, it would not do business with them.  Mr. Corbat, a gun owner who said the decision had not been made lightly, found the response to the bank’s move instructive.  “I would say from our employees, it has been overwhelmingly to virtually unanimously positive,” he told me. “I would say lots of positives from customers and clients. And then, as you know, the gun lobby is a strong lobby. I’ve gotten my share of people who staunchly disagree with us interfering in what they believe to be a constitutional right. And that wasn’t unexpected, and we certainly respect that opinion.” He added that he had expected to hear from customers who planned to “take their Citi card and put it in a drawer or cut it up” — and that Citi had received such responses. But ultimately “the positives have significantly outweighed the negatives,” he said. For every negative note, he said, he has gotten many more “saying that ‘I’m moving everything I have to Citi as a response to this.’” Investors applauded, too. The board of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, a huge pension fund, issued a statement saying Citigroup was “modeling best practices and demonstrating actionable steps that others can take.” In the weeks since the Parkland shootings, I’ve had conversations with dozens of chief executives and other leaders from a variety of industries, many reaching out directly about the internal debates they have had. Virtually all the major banks, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America among them, have created formal or informal working groups to consider the issue, as have the big credit card companies, including Visa, Mastercard and American Express. (Perhaps the bank that’s least receptive to addressing the issue of guns is Wells Fargo, which has said it should be approached through the “political and legislative process.” Wells Fargo is the largest financier in the nation of the gun industry and is the main bank for the National Rifle Association, according to  Bloomberg.) With the exception of Citi, most financial institutions are still grappling with how to properly carry out a plan that is both enforceable and does not encroach on the rights of its customers.  While Citi’s decision is significant, Mr. Corbat acknowledged that it was intended to be balanced — and he purposely didn’t want it to be too broad. “This isn’t an easy thing to simply take a stance on,” he said, because of various privacy laws and rights. “There is an important nuance here,” he said. “We didn’t tell our hundred and sixty million card holders in the world how they can use their cards. It’s their money. But what we did say — in terms of the people that Citi is going to do business with, the ones that we’re going to finance and that we’re going to, in essence, put our brands together on — that there needs to be something that makes sense for us and for both sides.”      He said the bank had purposely left some of its policy ambiguous so it could accommodate potential exceptions — for example, to the 21-year-old age limit. “My inbox lit up with people saying: ‘Dear Sir, I’ve served in the military. Our country gave me a firearm when I was 18, and it was fine for me to go use that in the defense of our country,’” Mr. Corbat said. “We didn’t use the word prohibit,” he added. “We used the word restriction. And we think that part of this should evolve.” So if a person “had military training or you’ve had hunter safety training,” Mr. Corbat said, he could see an allowance for those individuals, though how that would be administered remains unclear. The focus on raising the age of gun buyers to 21 is not random: Individuals ages 18 to 20 commit homicides using guns at a rate that’s four times higher than the rate for those over 21, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, using F.B.I. and census data. While other institutions seem to be waiting to find the perfect solution, Mr. Corbat said, he decided he needed to act. “There’s things you can do today, and there are those things that maybe we have the ability around technology or other things to do in the future,” he said. Here are two new ideas that the financial community might want to consider. I’ve shared these ideas with many of the biggest financial institutions, and the feedback, with some exceptions, has been quite positive.  One of the biggest complaints that banks and credit card processors have is that it is very difficult for them to know what products a merchant is selling. Banks do not get access to the specifics of each purchase. The only information they get is a Merchant Category Code, known as an M.C.C. Oddly enough, a gun dealer and Modell’s share the same M.C.C.: “sporting goods.” So a bank or processor has no idea if you’re buying a gun or sneakers. If the credit card companies and banks agreed, they could come up with a series of subcodes that would identify retailers that sold guns under a “best practices” policy — like the policy that Citigroup proposed or the one that Walmart and Dick’s follow — and the ones that don’t. It would add transparency to the process, and it would give banks that issue credit cards the opportunity to decide which retailers they wanted to associate with. This solution is hardly a panacea. Retailers could try to game it, and it would require some enforcement. But much of that could be accomplished through crowdsourced feedback from customers. The addition of a new level of detail to the M.C.C. might add pressure on gun retailers to voluntarily follow the “best practices” route. The second technological solution is deceptively simple, but it could change the way guns are sold at gun shows, where in some states background checks are not required. Many of the sales at gun shows are done through services like Venmo and Square — both of which refuse to knowingly process the firearm sales under their terms of service. Given that gun shows are public events with specific addresses and times, payment services could use GPS coordinates to electronically geo-fence the event — so that their services limit transactions to users over 21 or require additional information for sales to be processed from that location. In the world of banking, there is an abbreviation that is considered sacrosanct: K.Y.C., or Know Your Customer. It seems only reasonable for the financial industry, especially when it comes to guns, to do more to know its customer.

U.S./Politics,330," By NIRAJ CHOKSHIFEB. 26, 2018 Should the women who have accused the president of sexual misconduct be believed? That’s a question that his elder daughter and White House senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, believes she should not be asked. “I think it’s a pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter if she believes the accusers of her father when he’s affirmatively stated that there’s no truth to it,” Ms. Trump told the NBC News correspondent Peter Alexander in an interview that aired on NBC’s “Today” on Monday. Ms. Trump had been in South Korea since Friday, leading the United States delegation at the Winter Olympics. In a wide-ranging interview there on Sunday, Mr. Alexander asked her, “Do you believe your father’s accusers?” “I don’t think that’s a question you would ask many other daughters,” she said. “I believe my father. I know my father. So, I think I have that right as a daughter to believe my father.” 
            “Do you believe your father’s [sexual misconduct] accusers?” -@PeterAlexander“I think it’s a pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter if she believes the accusers of her father when he’s affirmatively stated there’s no truth to it.” -@IvankaTrump pic.twitter.com/23AVPgcOdE         Ms. Trump’s suggestion that she be spared the question faced pushback online from journalists and others, who noted that she not only led the American delegation for the closing ceremony of the Olympics, but has also positioned herself as a voice for women’s issues inside the White House.  Some conservatives, in the meantime, suggested that her dismissal of the question was akin to one offered by Chelsea Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign, when asked whether her father’s sex scandal had affected her mother’s credibility.  In the NBC interview, Ms. Trump also said that she had not yet been interviewed by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, but that she believed Mr. Mueller could be trusted. She also repeated the White House’s denials that her father’s presidential campaign had colluded with Moscow.      “Consistently we have said there was no collusion,” she said. “There was no collusion. And we believe that Mueller will do his work and reach that same conclusion.” Ms. Trump also appeared to diverge slightly from her father, who, in response to the fatal shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., this month, had suggested that arming some teachers could improve school safety. “To be honest, I don’t know,” she said. “I think that having a teacher who is armed, who cares deeply about her students, or his students, and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it’s an idea that needs to be discussed.”  ",2018-02-26,0.0021643518,Monday
Opinion,331," Supported by Editorial By The Editorial Board President Trump on Thursday repeated his call for “highly trained” schoolteachers to pack heat in their classrooms. If they were armed, the president said, they could fire back immediately at school shooters like the young man with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle who took 17 lives in Parkland, Fla. Beyond that, he tweeted, the knowledge that teachers have guns of their own would deter “the sicko” from heading to a school in the first place. With his usual fondness for capital letters, he added, “ATTACKS WOULD END!” Thus did Mr. Trump parrot a tired shibboleth repeated once again on Thursday by Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association. “To stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun,” Mr. LaPierre told a gathering of conservative activists. Actually, it’s hard to tell who was parroting whom. The president said much the same in a morning tweetstorm that said “a ‘gun free’ school is a magnet for bad people.” Let’s ask someone who’s in the trenches every day what he thinks of arming teachers. “It’s hard to begin to count the number of ways this is a bad idea,” said Chris Magnus, police chief of Tucson. For starters, the number of gunslinging educators would be huge. In the United States, there are about 3.5 million elementary and secondary school teachers in public and private institutions. Arming 20 percent of them, as Mr. Trump suggested, would mean 700,000 or so teachers with Glocks and the like on their hips — an armed force half as large as America’s real armed forces on active duty. One can envision parents with the means to do so swiftly yanking their children out of that sort of environment. More to the point, many deranged mass murderers expect to die themselves during their killing sprees. It’s almost laughable to believe that the president’s proposal would deter them. “Why would we think someone who has those kinds of problems is going to make rational decisions based on the fact that someone in the school might be armed?” Chief Magnus said. And then there’s this inescapable reality: Teachers are human. It means they would most likely react to stress-induced fear the same as anyone else, with unintended consequences that could put even more people in peril. You want people highly trained in the use of firearms? The New York Police Department has about 36,000 of them. Generally, despite an impression held by some people, they are restrained in firing their weapons. But in high-stress situations, they’re human, too. “Police officers miss a lot in combat situations,” said John Cerar, a former commanding officer of the department’s firearms and tactics section. Nationwide statistics on police shooting accuracy are not to be found. But if New York is typical, analyses show that its officers hit their targets only one-third of the time. And during gunfights, when the adrenaline is really pumping, that accuracy can drop to as low as 13 percent. While Mr. Cerar thinks armed teachers could provide some deterrence, he said that experience shows, “Whatever you do, there’s going to be a problem associated with it.” One problem is shooting bystanders. It isn’t routine, but it does happen. To cite just one example, from 2012, two New York officers shot and killed a gunman on a busy street outside the Empire State Building. But they also wounded nine other people who were hit directly or struck by shrapnel from ricochets. It takes little imagination to foresee a situation in which a frightened teacher, thrown into a combat situation — in a crowded space like a school hallway or classroom — wounds students in the process of trying to take out a gunman. The best way to prevent the threat of a bad guy with a gun is to keep him from getting the sort of battlefield weapon the Parkland killer used, by banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and by tightening background checks. In his remarks, the mendacious Mr. LaPierre said gun restriction advocates seek to “eradicate all individual freedoms.” In fact, sensible gun laws would give people, especially children, a better chance to enjoy the first of the inalienable rights mentioned in the Declaration of Independence: life.

NYTNow,332," By KAREN ZRAICK and SANDRA STEVENSONMARCH 29, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The clash between Russia and the West is intensifying. Russia will expel 150 diplomats, including 60 Americans, in retaliation for Western measures designed to punish Moscow for its alleged role in a nerve-agent attack on a former spy in Britain. Russia denies any involvement. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, above, summoned the American ambassador, Jon Huntsman, to his office to give him the news. The Americans were given until April 5 to leave the country. The daughter of the spy, who was also poisoned, is showing improvement as she recovers in a British hospital.  ____ 2. The Trump administration is expected to launch an effort to weaken standards for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy for automobiles. That would be a major victory for car manufacturers, giving them ammunition to potentially roll back industry standards worldwide.  Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is expected to frame the initiative as eliminating a regulatory burden on automakers that will result in more affordable vehicles for buyers. An E.P.A. spokeswoman confirmed that Mr. Pruitt had sent a draft plan to the White House for approval. Above, an emissions test. ____ 3. President Trump was in Ohio, where he heralded  a new trade agreement with South Korea — but then suggested he could delay finalizing it while negotiating with North Korea over its nuclear program. Earlier in the day, he took to Twitter to rail against Amazon, accusing the company of not paying enough taxes and abusing the post office. We fact-checked his claims. And on Wednesday night, he placed a personal call to a political supporter with a huge megaphone. That would be Roseanne Barr, who got huge ratings for the premiere of her series reboot on Tuesday. ____ 4. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea agreed to meet for the first time on April 27. They’ll get together at the so-called truce village of Panmunjom, near their shared border. Above, South Korean negotiators there on Thursday.  Mr. Kim would be the first leader from the North to set foot in the South since the Korean War. He is also supposed to meet with President Trump in May, but no date has been set. ____ 5. We examined the record of John Bolton, President Trump’s new national security adviser, who will surely be a key figure in the North Korea talks. He has a reputation as a “kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy.” Hear more on “The Daily.” Above, Mr. Bolton, left, with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. And we published an Op-Ed essay by David Shulkin, who was replaced yesterday as secretary of veterans affairs. “In recent months, the environment in Washington has turned so toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important work that our veterans need and deserve,” he wrote. Having trouble keeping track of all the turnover in the Trump administration? You’re not alone. Here’s our running tally. ____ 6. “I never wanted to leave my country.” Malala Yousafzai, the world’s youngest Nobel laureate, returned to Pakistan for the first time since she was gravely wounded there by a Taliban attack in 2012. Ms. Yousafzai, now 20 and studying at Oxford, is expected to stay mostly in Islamabad, the capital, during her four-day visit. Above, a meeting with Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. ____ 7. In Venezuela, at least 68 people died after a fire broke out during a prison riot in the northern city of Valencia.  Enraging Venezuelans and rights advocates, the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at grieving relatives who gathered outside the jail overnight demanding information. Above, a victim was buried. With Venezuela in an economic collapse, inmates throughout the country are going hungry. Gangs, weapons and bribery are common — and protests are on the rise. ____ 8. The Fox News host Laura Ingraham, above, apologized for taunting a survivor of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., as at least four companies confirmed they would pull ads from her show. The dispute began when Ms. Ingraham shared an article about the student, David Hogg, 17, getting rejected from some colleges — and accused him of whining about it. “On reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week, I apologize for any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland,” she said. ____ 9. It was opening day for Major League Baseball. Rain in Cincinnati, above, and Detroit ended a plan to have all 30 teams play. But the other 26 were still on deck, and ESPN has a national quadruple header. Here’s the lineup. ____ 10. The comedian Dana Carvey impersonated John Bolton, President Trump’s incoming national security adviser, in an interview with Stephen Colbert on “The Late Show.” It was a bit reminiscent of Carvey’s famous impression of the first President George Bush — but a few notches more ludicrous.  By the end, his face was covered in an overgrown mustache, and he was attempting to breast-feed a golden retriever puppy. ____ 11. Finally, John Legend will play the title role in a live concert version of “Jesus Christ Superstar” airing Sunday night on NBC. We talked to the lead performers about their roles. And we were remiss yesterday not to include Passover recipes in our final item. Our Cooking team, of course, has many, including a 13th-century haroseth recipe from Provence and a simple but satisfying matzo ball soup. Browse the full collection here.

None,333," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 13, 2018, 7:28 P.M. E.D.T. JACKSON, Miss. —  A Mississippi high school senior was jailed without bail Friday after the FBI charged him with threatening a school shooting over social media, but his defense lawyer says officials are misreading the student's dark humor. After a hearing in federal court in Oxford, U.S. Magistrate Judge Roy Percy ordered 19-year-old Nathan Caleb Brown of Southaven held in the Lafayette County jail, finding him too dangerous to release. Court papers show officials confiscated three handguns, two knives and ammunition from Brown's home. The FBI arrested Brown on Thursday at DeSoto Central High School in Southaven. Court papers show Brown admitted the postings in questioning at the school. ""Brown stated the whole basis for these tweets was to be funny online,"" wrote Special Agent Charles Boling in a sworn criminal charge filed Thursday. Boling added Brown was asked ""how he thought normal people would receive the posts, and Brown responded that he could see where it would be concerning for people outside his social group.""  The charge of transmitting a threat across state lines carries a prison sentence of up to five years in federal prison.  Defense lawyer Steve Farese said Brown's parents testified at the Friday detention hearing has never been in trouble, has no violent tendencies and has never owned or fired a gun. Farese said it's ""undisputed"" that the guns, including one that was loaded, belong to Brown's mother and were found in her bedroom. Farese said he Brown's actions don't justify him being charged with a federal crime, saying Brown and other teens communicate things electronically that would have never been circulated widely in previous generations. ""No longer can you sit at home and write in your personal journal your fantasies,"" Farese said. ""You cannot put tone in an email or a text. You cannot understand the context of a dark joke."" The FBI, though, disagrees. Boling wrote that two different people outside Mississippi had reported Brown's tweets to the FBI ""as potential threats of violence.""      The charge cites a number of tweets that Brown made between February and April, including one saying he wanted to ""make a Columbine v2,"" or version two of the 1999 shooting at the Colorado high school; one telling another user ""I can't believe you shot up a school without me"" on the day of a shooting at Great Falls High School in Maryland; and a tweet Monday threating a shooting at Snapchat headquarters after the service locked Brown's account. On April 1, court papers say Brown responded to a user who sent some of the tweets to the FBI saying ""They knew about Nikolas Cruz too,"" referencing the person accused in Feb. 14 shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school that killed 17. The Cruz tweet zeroes in on criticism of the FBI for ignoring tips warning about Cruz. ""I understand what they did and I understand why they did it,"" Farese said of the FBI. Officials began investigating after a March 19 tweet was reported, eventually tracked an internet address to a Southaven home, and observed Brown leave home and drive to DeSoto Central on Wednesday. Boling said a brief search of Brown's phone after his arrest ""revealed numerous searches involving serial killers and numerous photos of Columbine and other school shootings.""  The case will be referred to a grand jury and Farese said he hoped at some point to meet with prosecutors to discuss ""the totality of the circumstances."" Even if he's not convicted, Brown could face consequences up to expulsion for year at the high school from which he had been scheduled to graduate from in May, according to DeSoto County school discipline policies. Spokeswoman Katherine Nelson issued a statement acknowledging the arrest, but declined further comment. ___ Follow Jeff Amy at: http://twitter.com/jeffamy .

None,335," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 12, 2018, 3:40 P.M. E.D.T. Organizers are encouraging gun rights supporters to bring unloaded rifles to rallies at state capitols across the U.S. this weekend, pushing back against a wave of student-led gun violence protests that some see as a threat to the Second Amendment. A group called the National Constitutional Coalition of Patriotic Americans spread word of the gatherings on social media. Organizers have permits for rallies Saturday outside 45 statehouses, said David Clayton, of West Virginia, one of the coalition's founders. The rallies come less than three weeks after hundreds of thousands marched in Washington, New York and other U.S. cities to demand tougher gun laws after the February school shooting that killed 17 in Parkland, Florida. It's unclear how many will show up — turnout predictions of national organizers are vastly higher than those of local planners. Clayton said a new gun law in Florida and similar measures being considered in other states threaten the rights of law-abiding gun owners. He said those attending rallies are encouraged to carry rifles — unloaded, with no magazines inserted — in states where it's legal.  ""This is a very peaceful approach to a show of force,"" Clayton said. ""What that means is we're not going to go there looking for a fight. We're saying, 'Look at all the people gathered here. We have a voice too.'""  Most U.S. states allow long guns to be carried openly in public spaces, though other legal restrictions may apply. In Maine, for example, the statehouse grounds are a gun-free zone. Assembling near the state Capitol on Saturday could prove expensive, at least for organizers in Georgia. They're being asked to pay about $6,700 to cover overtime for state troopers to provide security. Capt. Mark Perry of the Georgia Department of Public Safety said that's because the rally is on a weekend — permitted assemblies are free on weekdays when statehouse security is fully staffed. ""It's an insult,"" said Atlanta rally organizer Chris Hill, who said he has no intention of paying. Other groups have been charged similar fees. Tim Franzen, who helped organize the March For Our Lives rally against gun violence in Atlanta on March 24, said organizers paid for statehouse security but he didn't recall how much. The coalition behind the gun rights rallies describes itself as a collection of patriotic-based groups that ""come from all walks of life, including Three Percent groups and local militias."" The Three Percent movement vows to resist any government that infringes on the U.S. Constitution. Its name refers to the belief that just 3 percent of colonists rose up to fight the British.      Clayton leads a group called the Three Percent Republic. Such groups lack the following of more mainstream Second Amendment advocates such as the National Rifle Association. An NRA spokeswoman did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Other gun rights organizations said they've played minor roles. Jerry Henry, executive director of GeorgiaCarry.org, said a few of the group's 8,000 members have emailed him asking for details about the rally in Atlanta.  ""We are not sponsoring it in any shape or form, but we're not opposing it,"" said Henry, who doesn't plan to attend. Clayton said the organizers' goal is for attendance to reach 1 million nationwide. That would require average turnout of 20,000 per state. Maine rally organizer Dave Gulya said he expects 500 to 1,500 people. The permit for Missouri's rally anticipates 100 participants. Mississippi rally organizer Monty Reeves estimated 50 to 200 people. Reeves and Gulya said they have no ties to militias or other such groups. Reeves owns a bolt-action rifle and a shotgun for hunting doves and squirrels near his home in rural Whynot, Mississippi. Gulya is a truck driver in Blue Hill, Maine, who likes shooting targets with handguns and rifles. He worries gun rights are slowly getting chipped away. ""As responsible, law-abiding gun owners, we seem to pay the price every time there's one of these tragedies,"" Gulya said. ""We've stayed silent long enough."" ___ Associated Press writers Lisa Marie Pane in Atlanta; Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Mississippi; and Blake Nelson in Jefferson City, Missouri, contributed to this story.

Foreign,336," By DAMIEN CAVEMARCH 28, 2018 Damien Cave, our Australia bureau chief, shares insights on Australia, news of the world and reader feedback in this weekly newsletter. Want it by email? Sign up. ______ I’m in rural Victoria this week reporting on immigration — part of our effort to explore Australia’s multicultural present and future — and I have to say, now I get why so many of you urged me to get out of the cities and into the country. This isn’t my first trip to regional Australia, and let’s put aside the “real Australia” argument; in my book, cities and towns are both reflections of national character. But just as dinner parties are different with six guests rather than 60, towns with a few hundred people do have a lot to teach about human interaction and how a country really works.  In my experience, towns of the singular — one market, one intersection — tend to produce a few things in abundance. Questions are among them. Visiting reporters rarely get too far without being asked about their plans, and within a day or so, word gets around.  If you’re deemed trustworthy, introductions are made, phone numbers are shared and people just appear to tell their stories. Pubs help. Here in Pyramid Hill, we arrived and dropped our bags in a couple of rooms at the Victoria Hotel around 3 p.m. on Monday. A few hours later, the local mayor stopped by for a chat and a beer on her way home from work. The local footy coach sat at the other end of the bar, beneath fading photos from decades past, and thanks to David Demaine, our friendly publican, I quickly discovered that the coach was married to the principal of the local public school, Pyramid Hill College. She appeared a few minutes later, not just at the pub, but at my table. No wonder writers love these kinds of towns. E.B. White, who inspired me as a child with “Charlotte’s Web” and again as a young reporter with his signature essay, “Here is New York,” lived on a farm in rural Maine for 48 years. Tim Winton, even as he promotes a new novel called “The Shepherd’s Hut,” still deliberately avoids telling anyone where he can be found in Western Australia to preserve the peace and quiet of his coastal community. And then there’s Gerald Murnane, the Australian literary savant who has landed in Goroke, a stretch of remote Victoria a few hours from where I am.  I’m half tempted to try to make the trip after reading this week’s fantastic profile of him in The New York Times Magazine. With minimal effort, I imagine I could find a way to fit in at the men’s shed where he and a bunch of other retirees spend a lot of time tinkering and talking. The shed reminded me a bit of the Op Shop here. (For the non-Aussies, that’s a vintage store, the “opportunity shop,” which sells donated goods, in this case to benefit the local nursing home.) I stopped in Tuesday afternoon and bought three antique port glasses from a couple of older volunteers who were mending dresses for some Filipino girls at the local Catholic school. Each glass cost me … go on, guess. Try 20 cents. The woman who sold them to me wrapped them carefully in gray paper to ensure they made it back to Sydney, and as we chatted about how the town was changing with the influx of Filipinos (more on that in a future story), I started to wonder what else I might buy. There was a big “for sale” sign out in front of the pub. My room was comfortable and clean. The place had good bones, solid wood floors, lots of space and decent water pressure. Would it be weird for The New York Times to buy into a piece of regional Australian life? Would it even be possible? Probably not. But in a place this friendly and quiet, it’s a ribbon of thought that keeps twirling. Now for the week’s reads … and a call for your recommendations about what to listen to, read or watch to better understand regional Australia.  Share your ideas in our Facebook group or by emailing nytaustralia@nytimes.com — and tell your friends to sign up for this newsletter and send their suggestions too! ______ Australians often ask me why Americans are so obsessed with guns, but what we’re witnessing now is a historic push in the other direction. Last Saturday, vast crowds of demonstrators gathered across the United States to protest gun violence. It was a triumph of organic, youthful grass-roots energy and sophisticated, experienced organizational muscle. In one poignant moment, Emma González, a survivor of last month’s shooting in Parkland, Fla., read the names of the victims before staring ahead for 4 minutes and 26 seconds to convey the length of the attack. You can see dispatches from our reporters on the ground and analysis of what this means for the future of gun policy in the U.S., here. ______ Who is Stormy Daniels? Read about her life and reputation — starting back when she was just Stephanie Clifford, a Floridian with ambition — before she took on her pornographic stage name, and long before she shook Washington with her claims to have had an affair with President Trump.

                Student Opinion             By                     
                                    CAROLINE CROSSON GILPIN
                            
                MARCH 28, 2018 The Second Amendment to the Constitution reads: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. The Library of Congress writes, “The meaning of this sentence is not self-evident, and has given rise to much commentary but relatively few Supreme Court decisions.” What do you think the words of the Second Amendment mean? What relevance should they have for the national debate about gun laws? Then read these four excerpts from Opinion pieces published this month in The Times — or follow the links to read the complete Op-Ed — and decide: What do you think lawmakers should do about guns and gun violence? Excerpt 1: In “John Paul Stevens: Repeal the Second Amendment,” John Paul Stevens, a retired associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, writes: Rarely in my lifetime have I seen the type of civic engagement schoolchildren and their supporters demonstrated in Washington and other major cities throughout the country this past Saturday. These demonstrations demand our respect. They reveal the broad public support for legislation to minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society. That support is a clear sign to lawmakers to enact legislation prohibiting civilian ownership of semiautomatic weapons, increasing the minimum age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 years old, and establishing more comprehensive background checks on all purchasers of firearms. But the demonstrators should seek more effective and more lasting reform. They should demand a repeal of the Second Amendment. _________ Excerpt 2: In “After the March, Follow This Gun Reform Battle Plan,” Steve Israel, a Democratic representative from Long Island from 2001 to 2017, writes: It has been 38 days since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.; 174 days since the shooting at a concert in Las Vegas; 1,011 days since the killings at a church in Charleston, S.C.; and 1,926 since the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Ten days ago, students organized a nationwide school walkout to demonstrate their outrage about these and other shootings. On Saturday they plan to amass in Washington to pressure a Congress that has done nothing meaningful to protect American children in classrooms, movie theaters, churches, malls — because, thanks to the National Rifle Association, many of their elected representatives are too busy protecting their re-election. My advice to the students? When you finish marching on the mall, march into the specific congressional districts where you can actually make a difference. He continues: You can stage marches and school walkouts, but then walk into the swing congressional districts that matter. In the end it’s not about standing up to be heard. It’s about changing who sits in Congress. _________ Excerpt 3: In “Stop Shielding Gun Makers,” Brad S. Karp, the chairman of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, and H. Christopher Boehning, a partner there, write: Senator Charles Schumer has proposed three measures to reduce gun violence: expanded background checks, protective orders to disarm individuals at risk of violence or self-harm, and an assault weapons ban. These proposals are critically important. But there is another effective response that has been largely ignored: repeal of a law that prevents suits against the gun industry. A bedrock principle of the American legal system is accountability for wrongdoing. Businesses that cause harm may be held legally responsible in a court of law. Through the imposition of financial liability, our legal system encourages businesses to reduce harm to consumers by making their products safer and disclosing the risks associated with their use. Thanks in part to the accountability imposed by lawsuits, society knows more about the dangers of smoking, and tobacco companies market their products more responsibly. Automakers continually develop and install new safety features, and these innovations deliver results: From 1975 to 2016, the rate of motor vehicle deaths decreased by nearly half. While motor vehicle deaths have declined over the last two decades, firearm deaths have not: According to the most recent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people now die from firearms than motor vehicle accidents. _________ Excerpt 4: In “Why Gun Culture Is So Strong in Rural America,” Robert Leonard, the news director for the radio stations KNIA and KRLS, writes: It’s been many years since I hunted squirrels and rabbits with my Grandpa Leonard. I grew up around guns and remember the pride I had when I completed my N.R.A.-sponsored gun safety training in Boy Scouts, back when the N.R.A. was a group primarily known for teaching gun appreciation and safety rather than lobbying. I have come to understand and appreciate arguments for more gun control. But guns are important to the culture in my conservative community in Iowa, and people around here reject most gun control legislation. So I do my best to understand where they are coming from. One morning after the mass shootings in Parkland, Fla., I spoke about them with a police-officer friend. He has led active-shooter trainings in our schools. He believes that better background checks might help prevent some gun violence, and that people need to do a better job securing their firearms (especially from suicidal teenagers). But he doesn’t believe that significant gun control measures will ever meet approval in rural America, including a ban on AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles. He confided that many conservative police officers do not want more gun control and that other officers have told him that should they ever have to start taking guns away from people, they will quit their jobs. Like most rural conservatives, he truly believes that taking guns away from law-abiding citizens will never solve America’s gun problems, including mass shootings. He says gun control has never stopped criminals from getting guns, and never will. _________ Students: After reading the four excerpts above, tell us: — Why does this topic interest you? How have your own experiences shaped your opinions? What questions or concerns does this topic raise for you?  — Do you believe the government is currently striking the right balance between public safety and protecting people’s individual rights? Why or why not?  — Would you rather the government err on the side of protecting an individual’s right to own a gun, or on the public’s health and safety? Or do you feel this is a false choice? Why? — After mass shootings or renewed fears that the government will ban gun ownership, many people go out to buy guns — perhaps to feel safer in times of insecurity. Americans now own more than 300 million guns. Do you think people buying more guns will prevent gun deaths? — How should we try to reduce the number of gun deaths and injuries in the United States? Do you think lawmakers should pursue any of the options discussed in the Opinion pieces above? If so, which ones, and why? — What other options or possible solutions exist, in your view, and why?

                MARCH 20, 2018 In your opinion, what makes someone a “good citizen”? What qualities does that person have? What actions does he or she take? In “The Man Who Knew Too Little,” Sam Dolnick writes: At first, the experiment didn’t have a name. Right after the election, Erik Hagerman decided he’d take a break from reading about the hoopla of politics. Donald Trump’s victory shook him. Badly. And so Mr. Hagerman developed his own eccentric experiment, one that was part silent protest, part coping mechanism, part extreme self-care plan. He swore that he would avoid learning about anything that happened to America after Nov. 8, 2016. “It was draconian and complete,” he said. “It’s not like I wanted to just steer away from Trump or shift the conversation. It was like I was a vampire and any photon of Trump would turn me to dust.” It was just going to be for a few days. But he is now more than a year into knowing almost nothing about American politics. He has managed to become shockingly uninformed during one of the most eventful chapters in modern American history. He is as ignorant as a contemporary citizen could ever hope to be. James Comey. Russia. Robert Mueller. Las Vegas. The travel ban. “Alternative facts.” Pussy hats. Scaramucci. Parkland. Big nuclear buttons. Roy Moore. He knows none of it. To Mr. Hagerman, life is a spoiler. “I just look at the weather,” said Mr. Hagerman, 53, who lives alone on a pig farm in southeastern Ohio. “But it’s only so diverting.” He says he has gotten used to a feeling that he hasn’t experienced in a long time. “I am bored,” he said. “But it’s not bugging me.” Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: — What do you think of Mr. Hagerman’s “Blockade” on the news? Is it a worthy undertaking? Or is it irresponsible? Why do you think so? — Would you ever consider doing something similar? Why or why not? — Have you ever reacted strongly to a news event? If so, what was the event and how did you handle it? Did you respond like Mr. Hagerman by taking a break from media for a while? Did it inspire you to become more engaged in the topic in some way? Or did you fall somewhere else on that spectrum? — In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don’t keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do? — Are there other ways to be a “good” citizen besides consuming media? If so, what are they? What — if anything — have you done to contribute to society in a way that aligns with your own passions and abilities? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

None,339," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 11, 2018, 5:16 P.M. E.D.T. MONTPELIER, Vt. —  Vermont on Wednesday raised the age to buy firearms, banned high-capacity magazines and made it easier to take guns from people who pose a threat — the first significant gun ownership restrictions in state history, signed into law by the Republican governor. It's a remarkable turnaround for the largely rural state that traditionally has refused to impose restrictions on gun ownership. Standing on the Statehouse steps before a noisy crowd of hundreds gun rights activists and supporters, Gov. Phil Scott signed the bills into law. Supporters shouted ""thank you,"" while opponents, many wearing hunter orange, shouted ""traitor!"" and booed the governor. ""This is not the time to do what's easy, it's time to do what's right,"" said Scott, who continued to speak despite loud chants from the two sides.  Scott, a gun owner, had urged the Legislature to pass gun restrictions in the aftermath of what police called a narrowly averted high school shooting in Fair Haven. Authorities said they learned a teen from Poultney was planning to kill as many people possible. He was arrested and charged Feb. 15, the day after a high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead.  Scott said the incident proved to him that Vermont isn't immune from the school violence that has plagued other parts of the country. ""This is one of those moments as a state when we have the opportunity to do things differently,"" Scott said. Vermont's new gun laws are mild by some standards. But they are part of a trend of states passing gun restrictions, prompted in part by the Florida mass shooting, said Robert Spitzer, a political science professor at the State University of New York at Cortland who has written books on gun policy. ""There has been movement in a number of states,"" Spitzer said. But Vermont is significant ""because Vermont is traditionally such a strong gun-rights state and has not moved in this direction in ages, if ever,"" he said. While gun control advocates have praised Vermont's new laws, the state's traditionally powerful gun rights advocates and members of the outdoor community feel betrayed by Scott, whom many supported during his 2016 election campaign. During debate on the legislation, many firearms owners milled around the Statehouse halls wearing hunter orange vests or hats.      ""The tyranny of democracy has overwhelmed the protections of my constitutional, individual rights,"" said Bill Moore, a firearms policy analyst for the Vermont Traditions Coalition who fought against the gun restrictions. Gun rights advocates in the state generally support taking guns away from people deemed dangerous or prone to domestic violence, both covered by the new legislation. But they fiercely oppose provisions in the laws that raise the age to buy firearms from 18 to 21, restrict the size of gun magazines and require background checks for most private gun sales. On Tuesday, a bipartisan group of Vermont lawmakers urged Scott to veto the bill that contains the provisions they find onerous.  Democratic State Sen. John Rodgers, who represents a rural area of the state known as the Northeast Kingdom and spoke fiercely against some of the gun restrictions, is considering a run for governor. ""It will affect law-abiding citizens while doing nothing to stop evil people and criminals from doing harm to others,"" Rodgers said of the legislation. But supporters of the restrictions say the time has come in Vermont. ""I think it sends a signal that the cultural shift ... is huge in Vermont, and I don't think there is anything in these bills that are going to take guns away from any law-abiding person,"" said Clai Lasher-Sommers, executive director of the Gun Sense Vermont, which was formed in the aftermath of the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 26 first-graders and educators dead. During the signing ceremony, gun rights supporter Ben Tucker, of Tunbridge, constantly yelled at the governor. ""This whole thing is wrong,"" Tucker said afterward. ""It's just wrong in every sense of the word."" Victoria Biondolillo, 20, of Barre, a University of Vermont student and Republican Party activist, said safety is paramount. ""I think it takes a lot of courage to stand up there when people are screaming at you,"" Biondolillo said of Scott. ""It brought tears to my eyes how proud I am of our state that we can work together on this.""  ",2018-04-11,0.0021277678,Wednesday
NewsDesk,340," Supported by By Kelly Virella and Josephine Sedgwick School gun violence and the terror it creates have riveted America again since a gunman shot and killed 17 last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The public outrage has produced a new wave of protests, including walkouts in schools across the country on Wednesday. But acts of violence aren’t the only source of school terror. For each heinous attack successfully carried out, there have been many more scores of threats in schools across the country. And while thankfully no one dies because of a threat, fake or foiled attacks can be terrifying, too.  After the Parkland attack, we reached out to students across the country, asking them to tell us about threats their schools have received. We heard from more than 100 teenagers, some describing hiding in dark closets and classrooms, sometimes for hours, as they braced for an attack. In the five months from August to December 2017, there were at least 671 bomb or gun threats — or both — directed at American schools, according to the Educators School Safety Network, a nonprofit that provides school safety training. In the past month, since the Parkland shooting, there have been more than 465 bomb or gun threats or both.  Here is a selection of the student responses, condensed and edited for clarity. We have corroborated each threat by reviewing local news reports and, in some cases, contacting the teenagers’ school districts and classmates. Winifred Chung, 18, is a freshman at the University of California, Berkeley, but was a senior at Westview High School in San Diego when her school was threatened last March. No gun was found, according to news reports.	 I was sitting in Physics last year when suddenly, we heard, “This is a lockdown, this is NOT a drill.” We calmly crawled under the desks, not thinking too much of it. And then rumors started flying on social media.  The general conclusion was that someone had a gun in their backpack, and that a kid saw and reported it. The thought of a possible shooting made me nauseous.  Our substitute teacher could not figure out how to lock the doors. Kids started making jokes out of the situation, and we were instructed to put our phones away. All I could think was, “I can’t believe my biggest fear could possibly come true in this moment.” I texted my parents that I loved them.  Alice Meyer, 16, is a junior at High Tech High School, in North Bergen, N.J. She was on campus when her school received this threat in September.	 The police were looking for someone they believed had a gun. Our whole school was put on lockdown, no one was sure what was happening. We had no idea if our school was being shot up or if everything was fine.  I thought my school’s name would be the next one in the headlines, that my friends would be among the dead and wounded. We were in the dark, hiding under desks, terrified of what would happen next. No gun was found, but that hour and a half was so beyond chaotic and terrifying.  Kathryn Ikeda, 18, is a senior at Johnston High School, in Johnston, Iowa. Her school received this threat in October.	 The Dark Overlord hacking group got personal information for almost every student in the district, including our addresses and parents’ phone numbers. They texted numerous parents, threatening to shoot up our schools.  As a result, school was canceled for one whole day while the threat was investigated, and delayed on the second day to allow time for security sweeps. It’s chilling to think how easily something like that could be orchestrated in my community. Rachael Lombardo, 18, is a senior at Upper Darby High School in Drexel Hill, Pa. In October 2014, when she was a freshman, her school received this threat. While a shooting has not occurred at my school, there have been threats of gun violence, and it’s almost become normal — even expected. My freshman year someone threatened to pull the fire alarm as a ploy to get students out of the building to shoot them.  I was terrified to go to school that day but my parents believed there was nothing to worry about, and while I trusted them, they didn’t feel what I felt. What they didn’t feel was the eerie silence that carried throughout the day while students breathed quietly, waiting for the ring of the fire alarm.  Instead of focusing on my biology work, I was thinking about how I would hide and where I could exit the building discreetly. Certainly, this is not what a 14-year-old high school freshman should be forced to think about. 	 Lily Powell Fagerlund, 18, is a senior at Ballard High School, in Seattle. The threat she describes came in November 2015, when she was a sophomore. Multiple times, there has been either the possibility of someone having brought a gun or actually bringing one to school.  The first time, I was in a lockdown for several hours and a kid was arrested down the street for bringing a gun to school. A weapon was never found. However, many people in my class, including me, were hiding in a closet, while many didn’t take it seriously and kept doing their schoolwork.   Soon we started to see giant SWAT teams with giant guns outside our windows and we knew that something serious had happened. I remember people crying and yelling at others to be quiet. It was chaotic.   Ruth Schultz, 17, is a senior at Princeton High School, in Princeton, N.J. Her school received this threat in May 2015, when she was a freshman. During my 8th grade and freshman years, various schools in my district received swatting calls periodically. When they called one school in the district, that school would go into lockdown and the rest would “shelter in place.”  It happened so often during my freshman year that, eventually, we barely paid attention when we were ordered to shelter in place, until one day our school received the threat. We went into lockdown, and everyone was scared. I remember very vividly thinking, If this is the end of my life, that’s tragic, but there’s nothing I can do about it. Noah Carroll-Promes, 18, is a freshman at Folsom Lake College, in Folsom, Calif., but was a student at Ponderosa High School, in Shingle Springs, Calif., when his school received threats.	 We have never had a shooting at our school, however we have had an individual walk onto campus with a gun.  We have also had threats on numerous occasions, mainly around the time final exams roll around — kids want to get out of taking finals and enjoy seeing the reaction they can elicit from the school.  George Lewis, 17, is a senior at Oak Park and River Forest High School in Oak Park, Illinois. Last October, his homecoming dance was the target of a threat. A shooting has never occurred at my school, but we received a threat before our homecoming dance and there was heavy police presence at the dance.  Emmet White, 17, is a senior at Grant High School in Portland, Ore. His school received a couple of threats in 2015 and then again in October.  During my sophomore year, we had a lockdown because of reports from passing drivers that two visibly armed men were walking down the street, toward the school, carrying high capacity rifles.  This year, my senior year, we relocated to a school in a different neighborhood while our original school is being rebuilt. One day, we heard a rapid succession of gunshots from an adjacent street. We went into lockdown, but the source of the gunfire was never found. Adrian Doan, 17, is a junior at Grosse Pointe South High School in Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich. In October 2016, his school was put on lockdown after a student claimed to have a weapon.  When we have been put into a lockdown because of the slightest threat, I get a horrible feeling — like what if this is real and these are my last moments on Earth? It almost sounds cliché, but I have truly wondered at all the things I’d never experience if I died at that moment. I cannot imagine how much more traumatizing an actual event would be.  Emma Choi, 18, is a senior at George C. Marshall High School, in Falls Church, Va. In March 2016, her school received an emailed threat.  A lot of us think that we’re invincible, that the things that happen on the news take place in a world separate from our own. But there was a period when a bunch of schools in my county were receiving bomb threats from a robotic caller. Our school received one via email. My parents got an email from the school about it and were assured that the threat wasn’t serious. Most of us students didn’t know about it until we got home.  Nancy Wartik contributed research.

NYTNow,341," Supported by By Karen Zraick and David Scull (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A dramatic moment at the White House: A father who lost his daughter in the Parkland, Fla., massacre made an impassioned plea to President Trump to ensure school safety. “How many schools, how many children have to get shot?” asked Andrew Pollack, above. The president is facing mounting pressure to take action against gun violence. Mr. Trump said his administration would be “very strong on background checks” of those wishing to purchase guns, and put “a very strong emphasis on the mental health of somebody.” ____ 2. There were also tense moments at the Statehouse in Tallahassee, Fla., where students from Parkland demanded a ban on military-style firearms, like the one used to kill 17 people at their school. Our political correspondent writes that Florida Republicans are facing unprecedented pressure to pass legislation addressing gun violence. But they appear set on a narrow resolution that stops well short of the clampdown the students are demanding. ____ 3. The Rev. Billy Graham died at 99. He was a farmer’s son who became a pastor to presidents and America’s best-known Christian evangelist. He spread his influence across the U.S. and around the world through a combination of religious conviction, commanding stage presence and shrewd use of radio, television and advanced communication technologies. You can hear his fiery preaching in this video. ____ 4. Border Patrol agents are searching people and property near the border — especially on Greyhound buses and Amtrak trains — more frequently. They’re using a little-known federal law more widely as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration. Officers are working without permission on private property and setting up checkpoints up to 100 miles away from the border. The practice has prompted anger — and legal challenges. ____ 5. Italians are preparing for national elections on March 4, the first in five years. The biggest issues are immigration and the weak economy. Our reporter went to Castellina in Chianti, the village in Tuscany where she grew up, to see how these forces are playing out. Young Italians like her have moved away in search of work. And families from Afghanistan, Albania, Bosnia, Macedonia, Morocco, Pakistan and Tunisia have moved in. “Take what has happened in Castellina and multiply it by thousands to understand how Italian towns and villages are changing,” she writes. ____ 6. One of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s closest and longest-serving aides appears ready to incriminate him. The aide’s agreement to become a government witness was the latest twist in a spiraling graft scandal dimming Mr. Netanyahu’s legal and political chances of survival, despite his insistence that he has done nothing wrong. The police are investigating whether Mr. Netanyahu — who is already battling separate bribery allegations — provided official favors to Israel’s largest telecommunications company in exchange for positive coverage in online news. ____ 7. As stories of sexual misconduct continue to dominate the news, a debate has erupted over encounters that may not be viewed as sexual assault, but constitute something murkier than a bad date. We’d like to hear from college students worldwide about the experiences you go back to, and how you handle consent — and apprehension — in intimacy. Here’s how to share your story. ____ 8. The State Department revealed how close Vice President Mike Pence came to sitting down with the high-level delegation of North Koreans at the Winter Olympics. The North Koreans canceled at the last minute. Ivanka Trump will be at the closing ceremony this weekend. Here’s our full coverage of the Games. Above, Dutch men’s team pursuit skaters. And we went back to the 1930s for this: Maribel Vinson was The Times’s first female sportswriter and an Olympic figure skater — at the same time. ____ 9. “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” the eighth — and the only theatrical — installment in the celebrated wizarding saga, begins previews on Broadway next month. It’s been wildly successful in London, with Jamie Parker, above, as Harry. Still, J.K. Rowling, is pretty nervous about it. “Broadway is a scary place,” the Harry Potter author told us. Unlike most family-oriented Broadway offerings, “Cursed Child” is a play, not a musical, and it will be competing with Disney’s “Frozen.” Oh, and it’s on the long side: 5 hours and 15 minutes, to be exact. (It’s staged in two parts, either seen on one day or on different nights.) ____ 10. Finally, Stephen Colbert cheered on the students protesting for gun control in Florida on “The Late Show.” “The adults aren’t cutting it anymore,” he declared. “I think we need to change the voting age. Until we do something about guns, you can’t vote if you’re over 18.” Have a great night. ____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

Science,342," By SHEILA KAPLANMARCH 12, 2018 Guns in the home protect families. For decades, that has been an essential part of the National Rifle Association’s mantra in defending firearms ownership, repeated at congressional hearings, in advertisements and on T-shirts. Dr. Mark Rosenberg, who once headed research on firearm violence at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wondered if there was any evidence backing the N.R.A.’s assertion. “So we looked at the question, does having a gun at home protect your family or not?” Dr. Rosenberg recalled. He was amazed by the answer. The landmark study in 1993 showed that bringing a gun into the home puts everyone at much greater risk.  “They were saying if you want to keep your family safe, if you are a real man, you will have a gun at home,” Dr. Rosenberg said. “Bringing the gun not only didn’t protect you, it put you at much, much greater risk.”  To this day, gun rights advocates dispute the study’s findings. The N.R.A. pushed Congress in 1995 to stop the C.D.C. from spending taxpayer money on research that advocated gun control. Congress then passed the Dickey Amendment in 1996, and cut funding that effectively ended the C.D.C.’s study of gun violence as a public health issue. The result is that 22 years and more than 600,000 gunshot victims later, much of the federal government has largely abandoned efforts to learn why people shoot one another, or themselves, and what can be done to prevent gun violence. After the Parkland school massacre in Florida last month, lawmakers and gun control experts have demanded that the agency take up the issue of studying gun violence again, arguing that the federal law doesn’t ban such research altogether but prohibits advocacy of gun control. Alex M. Azar II, the secretary for health and human services, said at a congressional hearing that he believed the C.D.C. should resume the work. “We’re in the science business and the evidence-generating business,” Mr. Azar said, ”and so I will have our agency certainly working in this field, as they do across the broad spectrum of disease control and prevention.’’ At a meeting with reporters last week, Mr. Azar said that other priorities, like fighting the flu and Ebola, also competed for funds. He did not specify which subjects would be a priority, how much money he might ask Congress to allocate to gun violence research, or whether he will transfer money from other health agency programs. There is no shortage of ideas — or criticism of the time lost in studying gun violence. “We have repeatedly and consciously turned our back on the problem,” said Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine who in July started the Firearm Violence Research Center at the University of California, Davis, with funding from the state. “How many thousands of people are dead today who might have been alive if that research effort had been put in place and we had answered critical questions and set prevention measures in motion?” It’s a question that haunts researchers. In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, President Obama directed the C.D.C. to reconsider gun violence research. The agency commissioned a report from the Institute of Medicine outlining priorities, but never followed up.  The most pressing questions cited by the institute, now known as the National Academy of Medicine, still have no answers. Who is most likely to use a gun in a crime, and where does the gun come from? How often are guns used in domestic violence cases? How often are the people who are arrested for gun crimes the same individuals who actually bought the weapons? Then there is a separate set of questions about what kind of policy changes or prevention efforts actually reduce gun-related deaths and injuries. Andrew R. Morral, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation, directed a recent study  that found moderate evidence that background checks do reduce both firearm suicides and homicides. The report also said there is moderate evidence that stand-your-ground laws, which allow people to use guns to defend themselves without first trying to retreat, may increase the murder rate. “In many cases, we’ve been having arguments about factual matters for decades,” Mr. Morral said. As an example, he cited laws that seek to prevent children from killing themselves or others with guns. “The N.R.A. has argued that such laws make it tough for people to defend themselves in a crisis,” Mr. Morral said. “But there’s no research on that. We’ve argued and argued and argued, and we have not invested in the research needed to answer the question: What is the trade-off between childhood deaths and self-defense?’’ The new set of proposals by President Trump calls for a commission to examine whether to raise the age to 21 from 18 for young people to buy certain firearms. Just after the Parkland killings, Mr. Trump repeatedly supported raising the age, but the latest proposals do not include such a measure — one that the N.R.A. opposes. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, who was director of the C.D.C. from 2009 to 2017, said in an email that he believed the study of firearms-related violence was important even though little was conducted during his tenure. “That’s why year after year I asked Congress to fund C.D.C. to do research in this area,” Dr. Frieden said. ”We need to know which interventions are most effective and how they can best be implemented to save the most lives.”  But Congress refused to include funding for those proposals, he said. The National Institutes of Health has continued to fund some gun violence research, including violent crimes related to drug and alcohol consumption, and parental roles in preventing injury from firearms.      N.I.H. is also assessing ways to reduce suicides and accidental deaths among children and adolescents and war veterans. More than 60 percent of all gun deaths in the United States are suicides. The Justice Department also studies gun violence, but the budget for that research is a small fraction of what the federal government spends on looking at other high-mortality hazards, like car accidents or smoking — money that has led to actions that greatly reduced deaths in both categories. Private foundations have stepped up to fill the gap. But there is another congressional roadblock that private money cannot circumvent — the Tiahrt Amendments, which prevent the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from sharing its firearms-tracking database with anyone outside of law enforcement. Those records, Mr. Morral and other experts say, are crucial to analyze the flow of guns used in crimes over state borders, from places where guns are easy to buy to places where it is tougher. The Dickey Amendment technically did not ban gun research, only advocacy. Its real goal — one it easily achieved, according to public health officials in place at the time — was to scare federal agencies into thinking twice about even collecting data that might reflect badly on gun ownership. Since the Parkland murders, there have been signs of change. Several Republican lawmakers said they would support the C.D.C. taking on the issue. “There’s a tremendous misunderstanding here and maybe an overabundance of caution on the part of C.D.C. and N.I.H.,” said Representative Tom Cole, of Oklahoma, chairman of a House appropriations subcommittee that oversees funding for the health and human services department. In an interview, Mr. Cole also said he expected there would be money available for such work at both N.I.H. and C.D.C., but not until next year’s appropriations.  Some Democrats are pressing to take advantage of the new mood on Capitol Hill. Senator Patty Murray, of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the health committee, and Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, have both pressed Mr. Azar for details, but as of Friday neither had received a response. “From fighting cancer to decreasing road traffic fatalities, public health research has played a critical role in saving lives,” Ms. Murray wrote to Mr. Azar. ‘‘It is immoral and unacceptable to treat gun violence any differently.” In the House of Representatives, Democratic members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce have called for a hearing on the adequacy of federal research into gun violence. Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the N.R.A., said the group continues to support the Dickey Amendment. “We oppose taxpayer dollars being spent to advocate for gun control,” Ms. Baker said. Asked if there is any type of research the group would support, she said the N.R.A. would like to see a study of how often firearms are used in self-defense. The Institute of Medicine report, published with the National Research Council, is still considered a road map by the C.D.C. The report proposed research on issues like motivations for gun ownership and use; the relationship between poverty and gun use; risk factors that lead youths to carry guns; and dozens of other questions. The C.D.C. did ask for and receive money to expand its National Violent Death Reporting System, which tracks homicides and suicides in 40 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The project aims to help state health departments develop strategies to reduce violent deaths, but some critics say the database lacks sufficient detail to be very useful. Research proponents want to make sure that new studies don’t serve as an excuse for a lack of action on gun control. “Although more gun research is needed,” Dr. Frieden said, “there are proven means to reduce gun violence, including better background checks, getting guns away from domestic abusers and people convicted of violent crimes, and safe storage. More research can help. But this is no excuse for inaction.” Margot Sanger-Katz A version of this article appears in print on March 13, 2018, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: The Case for Studying Gun Violence.

Opinion,343," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Seth Schiesel Donald Trump has long claimed that exposure to simulated violence in video games begets violent tendencies in real life. “Video game violence and glorification must be stopped — it is creating monsters!” he tweeted in 2012. In the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., as the nation debated gun control, Mr. Trump returned to that theme. “We have to look at the internet because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds, and their minds are being formed,” he said. He went on to implicate video games in particular: “I’m hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts.” On Thursday, President Trump summoned video game executives to the White House to castigate them for the violence depicted in their products. The executives were joined by Republican members of Congress and by activists who have campaigned against violence in media. The White House meeting did not, however, include any social scientists who have studied the effects of video games. That would have been too problematic. Decades of research, after all, have failed to find any significant relationship between playing violent video games and behaving violently in real life. If anything, there may be a stronger connection between school violence and the sort of creative writing educators seek to foster. When the United States Secret Service and the Department of Education studied violence in schools, they found that 37 percent of attackers “exhibited an interest in violence in their own writings, such as poems, essays, or journal entries,” while only 12 percent exhibited an interest in violent video games. Video games do not create murderers. With his Thursday meeting, the president was merely engaging in political distraction. And yet Mr. Trump was absolutely right when he said that “bad things” are happening on the internet. Video games do have a big problem, but it is not stylized virtual violence. Rather, it is the bigotry, social abuse, sexism and other toxic behavior to which players too often subject one another when gaming together online. In other words: It’s not the content; it’s the culture. Listen to the voice communications of almost any popular online first-person shooter game and you will hear players constantly using racial and homophobic slurs. Make a mistake in just about any team-based combat game and it won’t be long before one of your teammates chastises you with some vile epithet. There is more than one game community where “Jew” is used as a verb, meaning to make money. In many games, women who speak up on voice communications are routinely mocked and harassed. While researchers have devoted ample time to studying the emotional and psychological effects of virtual video game violence, the actual social behavior of players has largely escaped academic attention. That should change. The racism, homophobia and misogyny prevalent in many online game precincts can amount to emotional abuse. This is a phenomenon that needs to be better understood and more widely known. In this respect, Melania Trump’s campaign against cyberbullying, largely rhetorical though it is, addresses a more serious problem than does her husband’s concern with virtual gunplay. But there is not much the government can do about this. Game companies, too, cannot be expected to constantly police the communications and communities of millions of players. Some companies, such as Blizzard Entertainment (the creator of “World of Warcraft”) and Riot Games (“League of Legends”), deserve credit for at least attempting to curb the toxicity of their customers, allowing conscientious players to report their obnoxious peers and then devoting personnel to reviewing complaints and disciplining consistently abusive players. But it is a gargantuan task. As with many cultural crises, it is up to everyday people, not politicians or executives, to generate true solutions. The real responsibility lies with the players themselves — and for younger players, to their parents as well — to confront the real problem with video games.

NYTNow,344," By KAREN ZRAICK and BRENT MURRAYMARCH 25, 2018 Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. “Welcome to the revolution.” That was Cameron Kasky, a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., at the March for Our Lives against gun violence in Washington. He was addressing “the leaders, skeptics and cynics who told us to sit down and stay silent.” Hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets around the world for sister marches. Inspired by survivors of the Parkland shooting, in speeches and with colorful signs and chants, they called for gun control measures and vowed to continue their campaign as the midterm elections approach. You can hear some of the speeches in this video, and here’s a photo gallery. Above, two students at the rally in the capital: Jada Wright, 17, and Carl Payne, 18, from Eastern Senior High School in Washington. Did you keep up with the headlines this week? Test your knowledge with our news quiz. And here’s the front page of our Sunday paper.  ____ 2. It was a crazy week in Washington, even by Washington standards. A head-spinning series of presidential decisions on national security, trade and the budget left the capital reeling — and White House aides nervous about what comes next.  As two hard-line hawks are set to take key posts — that would be John Bolton as national security adviser and Mike Pompeo as secretary of state — President Trump’s team faces dire challenges. Topping the list: North Korea and Iran. Then there are domestic challenges, including the one posed by Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film actress who says she had an affair with Mr. Trump. She is suing to get out of a nondisclosure agreement, and is scheduled to appear on “60 Minutes” on Sunday. ____ 3. Calls for privacy in the wake of revelations that a political consulting firm that worked for the Trump campaign harvested Facebook data without user permission could upend tech companies’ business model. Above, Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, addressed jittery employees. Facebook, Google and other firms got big by offering free services in exchange for data that could be used by advertisers. But there are growing calls from consumers and regulators — in the U.S. and in Europe — to crack down on privacy violations. Meanwhile, the Justice Department and the F.B.I. are pushing tech firms to allow them access to encrypted data on phones during investigations. ____ 4. Lucky breaks, surveillance video and a pair of pink gloves led investigators to Mark Conditt, the 23-year-old suspect in a series of mysterious bombings in Texas. He died in an explosion as investigators closed in on him early Wednesday. (Above, the scene of that explosion.) He left behind a 25-minute recording that the police said was a confession, but which shed no light on his motives. The two people killed in the bombings belonged to prominent African-American families in Austin, which led many to believe they were racially motivated. Anthony Stephan House, 39, was a father and finance professional. Draylen Mason, 17, was a promising classical musician.  ____ 5. “Whenever I hear a blast go off in my hometown the first thing I do is call my little brother.” That is Fatima Faizi, above, a young reporter in our Kabul bureau, describing how she covers suicide bombings. She has experienced eight of them since 2016. The most recent was a devastating attack near a hospital as residents celebrated Nowruz, the Persian New Year. Thirty-one people were killed. We also talked to a Ukrainian soldier who deserted the Soviet Army and ended up staying in Afghanistan for more than three decades. ____ 6. We obtained documents that show Uber’s self-driving cars were struggling even before one struck and killed a woman in Arizona. Above, investigators inspecting the vehicle. The authorities are still investigating the crash and have not determined whether the car was at fault. Uber has halted autonomous car tests in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. Tech companies and automakers are spending billions developing self-driving cars, but there are few federal rules governing their testing. ____ 7. There’s a new economy in the Houston suburbs hit hardest by Hurricane Harvey: the buying and selling of flooded homes. We sent a team to Canyon Gate, a subdivision built in a reservoir area designed to flood in order to protect central Houston. Nearly all of the homes are destined to flood again.  “I was flooded, too, I get it,” said Nick Pelletiere, above, who is both a resident and a speculator. “But this hurricane is a monstrous opportunity.” You can see more of the rebuilding in this video, and these maps explain how the reservoir system is designed. ____ 8. Our reporter recently spent 10 days on the road rediscovering Quebec, where he was born, after nearly three decades away. He met a wide array of people along the way. Here are portraits of some of them, including an Algonquin D.J. (that’s Cory Whiteduck, above), a Muslim leader, the doorman at Quebec City’s grandest hotel and a well-known detective novelist. ____ 9. The latest obituary in our Overlooked series is of the woman who invented the chocolate chip cookie. Ruth Wakefield, above, originally called her creation the Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie, after the popular Massachusetts restaurant she ran with her husband in the 1930s. As the Overlooked project started, we asked readers to suggest women they felt deserved, but didn’t get, obituaries in The Times. Here are the stories you told us about your grandmothers and great-grandmothers. ____ 10. Finally, come inside the Times Square studios where actors for Broadway’s biggest shows rehearse. Our annotated video shows a day in the life of the bustling space. Above, rehearsing a scene from “Frozen.” Looking for other ideas for what to read, watch or listen to? This week’s New York Times best-seller lists have No. 1 debuts in hardcover fiction with Clive Cussler and Graham Brown’s thriller “The Rising Sea,” and in hardcover nonfiction with Michael Isikoff and David Corn’s look at the 2016 presidential election, “Russian Roulette.”  Our team at Watching has a list of some key episodes of “Roseanne” to rewatch before the series reboot premieres on Tuesday. (The old episodes are streaming on Amazon Prime; the new ones will be on ABC.) And our music critics have a new playlist out, with tracks by Shawn Mendes and Snail Mail, among others.

                FEB. 23, 2018 SAN FRANCISCO — Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo, technology columnist at The New York Times, reviews the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Farhad is off this week so Daisuke Wakabayashi and Jack Nicas, tech reporters at The Times, are stepping in. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Dai: Hi everyone. Farhad is off on a family vacation this week. (We’re not sure if he took his terrifying drone.) So our editor is leaving his work to us. We’ll try our best to match Farhad’s ratio of corny dad jokes to insight. I’m taking the reins with Jack Nicas, who joined our tech team last week. Jack: Hello, readers! I now cover Apple for The Times and previously covered Google at The Wall Street Journal. Dai covers Google for The Times and used to cover Apple at The Journal. Interesting strategy by The Times. Dai: It’s sort of like the business journalism equivalent of Parent Trap — maybe we can help reunite the two companies after their ugly divorce?  I hear you went to Apple this week. How was that? Jack: Apple Park, its new campus that is often compared to a spaceship, is imposing. Coincidentally, it reminded me of the headquarters of a powerful tech colossus from a science-fiction novel. The people were nice, too. They liked that I had the new iPhone; they weren’t impressed with my $10 watch.  Dai: Did you see any coasters for the HomePods or people walking into glass? Jack: The meeting was off the record. Jack: Well, another week, and another example of the big tech platforms promoting misleading or downright false information. On Wednesday morning, YouTube’s No. 1 trending video was a clip that seemed to push a conspiracy theory that some survivors of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting who have called for stricter gun control are actually paid actors. The video, of a TV news broadcast that included Parkland student David Hogg, carried the description: “DAVID HOGG THE ACTOR….” Dai: It’s repugnant that anyone would keep pushing these conspiracy theories about kids who have already suffered so much, but this video was a little tricky. It was a video of a legitimate news story involving the student. It wasn’t a false or doctored video, and the content itself didn’t push a conspiracy. However, the title on the video framed this otherwise innocuous video as evidence of a broader conspiracy. Even the description isn’t obviously inflammatory unless you understand the context of why this student is being called an actor. Man, YouTube can’t bring on those 10,000 human checkers fast enough. YouTube took down the video before I had my morning coffee in California, but only after it attracted more than 200,000 views. YouTube said it has been trying to make changes so things like this don’t happen, but “in some circumstances these changes are not working quickly enough.” Jack: This example also highlights another issue with YouTube: Its video recommendations can push people to misleading videos and conspiracy theories. YouTube’s video-recommendation engine is engineered to keep you on the site. It’s pretty darn good at it. YouTube said recommendations fueled a 10-fold increase in use of the site from 2012 to 2016, to more than 1 billion hours a day.      After I finished watching the trending two-minute David Hogg video on Wednesday, YouTube immediately began playing a new recommended video: a clip of Mr. Hogg speaking to reporters with the title, “David Hogg Can’t Remember His Lines When Interviewed for Florida School Shooting.” YouTube’s recommendation algorithm seeks out videos that are drawing traffic, and company engineers admit that approach can tend to reward sensational and salacious videos. YouTube can also contribute to so-called filter bubbles by feeding you videos with perspectives similar to those in videos you already watched. That also means its recommendations can be an embarrassing window into your psyche. I mean, I wouldn’t want to reveal my recommendations to thousands of readers, like clips from comically bad movies or 1990s pro wrestling. Dai: Maybe that ‘90s wrestling knowledge will be useful when President Rock is in the White House. Jack: It wasn’t just YouTube that spread false information about the shooting. There were also Facebook posts claiming survivors were so-called crisis actors, which were shared thousands of times. And your reporting with Sheera Frenkel this week showed that Twitter accounts suspected to be Russian bots mobilized to tweet about the Parkland school shooting shortly after it happened, often pushing both sides of the gun-control debate.  Dai: The sad reality is that whenever these tragic events take place in the near future, it’s going to be a test for these platforms to see how they weather the deluge of conspiratorial and false stories. It’s gotten to the point where the first instinct for tech reporters is to search for key phrases on Google, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Much of the time, the results are disappointing. Jack: Meantime, the executives that run these sites have been slow to acknowledge the severity of the problem. After federal prosecutors last week indicted 13 Russians and three companies for spreading misinformation online in an attempt to subvert the 2016 election, Facebook’s vice president for advertising, Rob Goldman, posted a series of tweets that downplayed their impact. Dai: Of course, he walked it back after President Trump amplified the comments to his followers, saying this was evidence that there was no collusion between his campaign and the Russians. Kevin Roose’s column on this really brought it home. Those tweets from Mr. Goldman made it look like the company’s P.R. strategy calls for prominent executives not named Zuckerberg to defend Facebook aggressively on social media — and it backfired in a major way. Jack: Before we sign off, can I pass along this additional bit of good news about the internet? Twitter and Facebook are rife with impostor accounts, and — stop me if you’ve heard this before — they are slow to crack down on them. Dai: Sometimes this feels like Sisyphus and the boulder. Farhad will be back next week with answers from many readers about the types of technology stories they want to read. I’m already preparing my five Logan Paul stories. Daisuke Wakabayashi writes about Alphabet and its many arms, including Google. Jack Nicas covers Apple. Both also write about broader technology trends and Silicon Valley.

None,346," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 9, 2018, 11:16 P.M. E.D.T. MIAMI —  For the Oklahoma City Thunder, clinching night was reminiscent of their season. Really bad start. Really good finish. Paul George scored 27 points, Russell Westbrook got his 25th triple-double of the season and the Thunder ran wild in the fourth quarter on the way to wrapping up a Western Conference playoff berth with a 115-93 win over the Miami Heat on Monday night. ""Half the league gets a chance to play in the postseason,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. ""You don't want to take things for granted. They should feel good about creating an opportunity to play after the regular season's over, but the thing I said to them after the game was we want to continue to play well, we want to continue to build, we want to continue to get better."" That's what Oklahoma City did all season. They started 8-12, are 39-22 since and got road wins over Houston and Miami in a three-day span to clinch the berth.  ""We're headed in the right direction,"" said George, who walked off a winner in Miami for the third time in 21 appearances. ""This is what we wanted. We wanted to come out of this road trip 2-0 and we did that.""  Westbrook finished with 23 points, 18 rebounds and 13 assists for the Thunder, who missed their first 10 shots and were down by 18 in the opening minutes before outscoring the Heat 39-12 in the fourth. It was the third-worst scoring margin for any quarter in Heat history, and the worst ever in a game at Miami. The Heat were called for 10 fouls in the fourth against three for the Thunder, and Oklahoma City shot 15 free throws in the final quarter — one more than Miami shot in the entire game. ""We had a lot of good things going, and then I think it was a combination of them marching to the free-throw line and us not executing on the other end,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Jerami Grant scored 17 points and Carmelo Anthony added 11 for Oklahoma City, which made 14 3-pointers. Anthony will be playing in postseason games for the first time since 2013, after four consecutive futile seasons with the Knicks.      ""Feels good to be back in the postseason and the mindset of not looking forward to another vacation,"" Anthony said. Josh Richardson scored 18 points and Hassan Whiteside added 16 for the Heat, who fell one spot to No. 7 in the East for now. Miami's playoff seed won't be decided until the season finales Wednesday. Justise Winslow and Tyler Johnson each scored 12 for Miami, and James Johnson added 11. ""We haven't done things the easy way,"" Heat guard Wayne Ellington said. ""I guess we like the challenge.""  TIP-INS Thunder: Westbrook needs 16 rebounds in the Thunder finale Wednesday to average a triple-double for the second straight season. He's also the second player with 2,000 points and 800 assists in back-to-back years. The other is Oscar Robertson, who did it five times. ... Alex Abrines was held out of the second half with concussion symptoms. Heat: Miami outscored Oklahoma City 58-32 in the paint. ... The Heat shot 5 for 22 from 3-point range. ... James Johnson got poked in the eye and Richardson banged a knee late, but both suggested after the game that they'll be fine. QUOTABLE ""We know we can beat anybody when we're playing our best,"" Westbrook said postgame. WADE HONORED Heat guard Dwyane Wade was presented with the NBA Cares Community Assist Award for March, recognizing his response to the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Wade and his wife Gabrielle Union donated $200,000 toward getting students to the ""March for Our Lives"" event in Washington last month. ""I came back to this city at a time when I was needed, when my voice was needed,"" Wade said. TITLE WINNERS Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski sat midcourt with Heat CEO Nick Arison, his former manager with the Blue Devils. Coach K was one of three accomplished college coaches at the game; Rick Pitino was also there, near Donovan — who played guard on Providence's 1987 Final Four team (coached by Pitino), and a two-time NCAA title winner at Florida before going to Oklahoma City. UP NEXT Thunder: Host Memphis on Wednesday. Heat: Host Toronto on Wednesday. ___ More AP basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball  ",2018-04-10,0.002058942,Tuesday
National,347," Supported by By Alexander Burns A prominent Republican political donor demanded on Saturday that the party pass legislation to restrict access to guns, and vowed not to contribute to any candidates or electioneering groups that did not support a ban on the sale of military-style firearms to civilians. Al Hoffman Jr., a Florida-based real estate developer who was a leading fund-raiser for George W. Bush’s campaigns, said he would seek to marshal support among other Republican political donors for a renewed assault weapons ban. “For how many years now have we been doing this — having these experiences of terrorism, mass killings — and how many years has it been that nothing’s been done?” Mr. Hoffman said in an interview. “It’s the end of the road for me.” Mr. Hoffman announced his ultimatum in an email to half a dozen Republican leaders, including Jeb Bush and Gov. Rick Scott of Florida. He wrote in the email that he would not give money to Mr. Scott, who is considering a campaign for the Senate in 2018, or other Florida Republicans he has backed in the past, including Representative Brian Mast, if they did not support new gun legislation. “I will not write another check unless they all support a ban on assault weapons,” he wrote. “Enough is enough!” Mr. Hoffman, a former ambassador to Portugal, has donated millions to Republican candidates and causes over the years, including more than $1 million to Right to Rise, a “super PAC” that supported Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign in 2016. A critic of President Trump, Mr. Hoffman has continued to donate heavily to other Republicans. Alluding to past mass killings, Mr. Hoffman argued in his email that future gun massacres were inevitable without government intervention: “If we go from Orlando to Las Vegas, and now Parkland, you just have to know that there are others around the country just dreaming about staging another mass murder.” Republican elected officials in Washington and Florida have shown no significant interest in considering new gun restrictions after the Florida school shooting. The party, which has full control of both the state and federal government, has traditionally opposed virtually all new limitations on firearms. Mr. Scott has resisted pressure to back new gun regulations after the killing of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Broward County on Wednesday, though he said “everything’s on the table” in a television interview. And Senator Marco Rubio of Florida voiced resistance to discussing gun control in a speech after the massacre, arguing in the Senate that a person determined to carry out an attack would find the weaponry to do it regardless of government regulations. His comments provoked outrage among some students who survived the shooting. A previous federal assault weapons ban, enacted in 1994 under a Democratic president and Congress, lapsed in 2004 while Republicans had full control of Washington. Mr. Hoffman acknowledged it was “not likely” that he would succeed in making the party more open to an assault weapons ban, and said Republicans were too beholden to the National Rifle Association. He has urged Republicans in the past to support certain firearms restrictions, without effect, but has not previously issued such a blunt threat. One of the recipients of Mr. Hoffman’s Saturday message, Mel Sembler, another former ambassador and ally of the Bush family, suggested he did not intend to join the proposed donation boycott. “I don’t plan on getting into this debate,” Mr. Sembler, who also lives in Florida, said in a brief email. Peter S. Rummell, a Jacksonville-based donor who gave $125,000 to Jeb Bush’s “super PAC” in 2016, said he was on board with Mr. Hoffman’s plan and would only contribute to candidates supportive of banning assault weapons. He said the Parkland shooting was a turning point: “It has to start somewhere,” Mr. Rummell said, of controlling guns. Even on its own, Mr. Hoffman’s money will be missed: He contributed heavily to Republican congressional candidates in 2016 and gave $25,000 last spring to the Senate Leadership Fund, a group backed by Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, that is focused on defending Republicans’ Senate majority. He said he would close his checkbook to that group and others like it, and would encourage others to do the same in the absence of action on guns. Mr. Hoffman said he would also be open to backing fiscally conservative Democrats who favor certain gun restrictions. “I’m going to email every single donor I know in the Republican Party and try to get them on board,” he said. “We’ve really got to start a little movement here.”        Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS",2018-02-17,0.0020550669,Saturday
National,348," By PATRICIA MAZZEIAPRIL 8, 2018 CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. — By the time a town hall-style meeting on gun violence ended Tuesday night, the gathering of more than 1,400 people — bursting into repeated standing ovations and a loud chant of “Vote them out! Vote them out!” — had taken on the electric feeling of a political rally being held days before a big election. Florida’s August primary is still more than four months away. The energized masses in Broward County, the most heavily Democratic county in the nation’s largest swing state, meant one thing for certain: trouble for Republicans, who have dominated Florida midterm elections for more a decade. “We woke. This is a community that woke,” Drew Shimkus, 52, a single father and registered Democrat, said as he left the auditorium with his son, Bruce Elkins, 15, a high school freshman. Democrats have reason for optimism, and not just because gun control has become a galvanizing issue in Florida politics after the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, an affluent Broward suburb that neighbors Coral Springs. Decision after decision by President Trump and his administration over the past year has forced Republicans campaigning across the divided state to either defend or break with the leader of their party.  The Republican Party’s best hope to help candidates navigate this treacherous new territory could come from an unlikely source: Gov. Rick Scott, who is expected to announce on Monday that he is running for the United States Senate against Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent.  Mr. Scott, a multimillionaire former health care executive whose style is more suited to the boardroom than the stump, is not frequently sought to campaign for fellow Republicans. But if the governor operates as he has in the past, he will likely spend big and early on television ads that could benefit other Republicans unable to purchase much airtime in Florida’s expensive broadcast markets. His campaign team, unencumbered by a serious primary challenge, will be able to focus on mobilizing voters for the November general election. In Mr. Scott, Mr. Nelson will face his toughest opponent since his election to the Senate in 2000; Democrats are expected to invest tens of millions of dollars to defend his seat. But Mr. Scott, too, will have to answer for Mr. Trump. He led a “super PAC” raising money for the president during the 2016 election, and has been a frequent guest at the White House and Mar-a-Lago, the president’s Palm Beach estate. In the past year, as he has prepared for the Senate race, Mr. Scott has broken with the president several times. He pressed the White House to let 32,500 Haitians, living in Florida under temporary protected status, remain in the country. He opposed the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that has protected many immigrants brought into the country illegally as children from deportation. He pushed against allowing oil drilling off Florida’s shores. And he made repeated trips to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, trying to establish a response to the catastrophic storm that was more proactive than the federal government’s. Most important, perhaps, Mr. Scott signed off on new restrictions on firearm purchases after the Parkland shooting in defiance of the National Rifle Association, neutralizing some of the opposition he would have otherwise faced from vocal students and their families. That has not stopped Democrats from accusing the governor of acting only when it was politically convenient, especially given the lack of state action after a gunman killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016. “On this issue, you know what, he pandered,” Mr. Shimkus said outside the meeting in Coral Springs. He said he plans to vote for Mr. Nelson. A few steps away, a yelling match broke out between people leaving the event and five protesters holding signs in support of gun rights. “You’re indoctrinated!” one of the protesters shouted at a woman at the end of a fiery discussion. “You want to protect metal, I want to protect life!” a female high school student screamed at the protesters moments later. As a statewide candidate, Mr. Scott will have some room to both embrace Mr. Trump on issues that are crucial to rural, conservative voters and reject him on matters important to urban liberals. That will be more difficult for Republicans running in congressional districts, especially in suburbs that have been trending lately in Democrats’ favor. Across the state, Republicans are trying to open narrow bits of daylight between themselves and the White House — and some have even shown a willingness to embrace moderate gun control measures. Representative Brian Mast of Palm City, on Florida’s Treasure Coast, has endorsed a ban on assault weapons, for example. Representative Carlos Curbelo of Miami helped introduce legislation that would raise the minimum age for purchasing any kind of firearm from 18 to 21.  On other issues, Mr. Curbelo has also warned that the tariffs Mr. Trump is imposing on steel are so broad that they might raise prices for residents of the Florida Keys who are trying to replace their metal roofs after Hurricane Irma. Representative Vern Buchanan of Sarasota has teamed up with Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, to work on a moratorium on offshore oil drilling around Florida. “You’re going to see more and more campaigns — even more so than normal — localize and focus on the local issues that matter,” said Max Goodman, a spokesman for Mr. Buchanan.      Mr. Buchanan aired the first of an eight-week, $130,000 television ad campaign last week as an election-year precaution, Mr. Goodman said. The congressman’s son, James, unexpectedly lost a special election for a local, Republican-leaning state House district in February. “It’s an offensive move, given this current climate,” Mr. Goodman said. “I don’t know if we’re nervous as much as we feel that we’re realists. It feels a little more like 2006 than 2010.” In 2006, riding a wave of discontent over President George W. Bush and the unpopular war in Iraq, Florida Democrats picked up two congressional seats, helping their party take control of the House of Representatives. But they failed to win the governor’s mansion that year and lost two of three elected state cabinet positions. That has encouraged Republicans running for governor to keep the playbook that has worked for them even when the national political environment has favored Democrats. Republicans have found midterm success in nominating candidates who appeal to the conservative base, said Brad Herold, a campaign adviser for Representative Ron DeSantis of Palm Coast, in northeast Florida, who is running for governor. “We’ve got the presidential endorsement. We’re not going to shy away from that,” Mr. Herold said, referring to a December post on Twitter by Mr. Trump backing Mr. DeSantis, before the congressman had even formally entered the race. Mr. Trump is expected to appear with Mr. DeSantis at a Florida event soon. Mr. Trump’s declared support for Mr. DeSantis has not stopped the congressman’s Republican primary rivals from continuing to praise the president and his policies. Richard Corcoran, the speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and a still-undeclared candidate for governor, released an explosive commercial in January — on the same day Mr. DeSantis entered the race — opposing so-called sanctuary states, which Mr. Trump has railed against. Mr. Corcoran’s graphic ad showed a hooded man firing a gun at a young woman. Adam Putnam, the state agriculture commissioner and the first major Republican to announce his candidacy for governor, grew up in his family’s citrus farming and cattle ranching business. He has touted Mr. Trump’s hard line on trade, even though it may result in retributive tariffs from China on Florida citrus and other crops.  “Nobody has ever gone to bat for Florida farmers and fought against illegal trade practices like President Trump,” Mr. Putnam said last week at a breakfast with Republican activists at a Cuban restaurant in Miami. While Republicans hope to win their primaries by sticking close to Mr. Trump, Democrats appear split on how much to make their own campaigns for governor about the president. Philip Levine, the wealthy former mayor of Miami Beach, has already spent millions of dollars on television ads, though none of them are aimed specifically at Mr. Trump’s character. “I don’t run against anybody,” Mr. Levine told a Jacksonville television station this week. “I run with my own message.” His chief rival, Gwen Graham, a former congresswoman from Tallahassee, has taken the opposite approach. In her first digital ad, released this week, she mentions the president by name four times. “Donald Trump is an embarrassment,” she says. Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.

Metro,349," By JOHN SURICOMARCH 30, 2018 It was a sign that Rita Prats had recently eyed with intrigue while walking down Second Avenue in Manhattan: “Plaza Prayers for Lent.” On the morning of Good Friday, she decided to follow its instructions, grabbing a pen and purple ribbon from the available box. “This one is for my older brother, Alfredo, who died yesterday,” she said, as she wrote. “I just want to thank him for the wonderful things he did during his life, and just how much he enjoyed his life.” Ms. Prats, 52, of East Harlem, then tied her purple ribbon to one of the many handrails and short birch trees outside of the Church of the Epiphany, an age-old Roman Catholic church in Gramercy Park, joining thousands of others before her who, for the last four weeks, have turned the church’s outside plaza into a public display of deeply felt love and loss. “Many cities, like Paris and London, have something like this, but New York City doesn’t. You’d get a summons if you did this anywhere,” Ms. Prats said, nodding to the ribbons behind her. “It’s a public expression that’s missing in this city, where we can say our hopes and feelings. People really need that.”  The sentiments varied in subject, with most concerning hardship on a more personal level. “Please keep my father safe and alive during his upcoming heart surgeries,” one read; another said, “I hope my grandmother gets better every day.” Several others addressed the anguish of the daily news cycle. “I pray for the victims of the Parkland shooting,” someone wrote. “To the lives lost in Syria,” said another.  Angelo Guzzo, 47, of Manhattan, held back tears when he tried to explain the ribbon he quickly signed on Friday. “It’s just for my two sons, my wife, and my mother, who’s battling cancer,” he said. “I’m not really religious, but I just think every little thing helps.” The ribbons were the idea of the Rev. James Mayzik, who arrived at the church in September from Fairfield, Conn. There, he had asked his congregants to do something they weren’t used to: write down personal prayers — ones that went beyond broad calls for world peace — on a small piece of paper and hand them to him. “I left with stacks of prayers,” he recalled. “And I realized just how emotional they were. ‘My son won’t talk to me.’ ‘We can’t pay our mortgage.’ I’d get choked up, and couldn’t finish reading them.” When he came to the Church of the Epiphany, Father Mayzik, 56, wanted to try the same exercise, but on a grand scale. He hung a few ribbons up first himself, and invited passers-by to participate with just a box and a sign. Thousands showed up. “It just shows that we’re all walking around here with these problems,” he said outside of the church on Friday. “But it’s all of us here. We’re all in this together.” On Easter Sunday, Father Mayzik plans to tie different colored ribbons around a large cross in the plaza’s center and leave them up for 50 days. He hopes to preserve the prayers in some way, he said, and return next year with more.      Karen Bettilyon slowly strolled through the plaza on her way out of services on Friday, reading as many ribbons as she could. One, written by a child, asked for students and teacher to be safe from gun violence, she said. Another prayed for the families in Puerto Rico who were still struggling in the wake of Hurricane Maria. “Just the difference in people’s prayers is what really strikes me,” Ms. Bettilyon said. “You really feel this mass of humanity, with their hopes, and worries.” Visiting her daughter from Chicago, Ms. Bettilyon, 57, said she had looked for a service to attend for Good Friday, but had not known about the “prayer plaza” at the Church of the Epiphany beforehand.  “It was something I wasn’t expecting to see or feel in New York, to be honest,” she said of the countless ribbons waving in the wind. “And this is just one corner of New York City. Think of all the prayers in the world.” A version of this article appears in print on March 31, 2018, on Page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: Outside a Church, One Small Corner of All the World’s Prayers.

Culture,350," Supported by By Brooks Barnes LOS ANGELES — The 20th Century Fox thriller “Red Sparrow” flew low at the domestic box office over the weekend, collecting an estimated $17 million and becoming the third lackluster opening in a row for Jennifer Lawrence. “Red Sparrow,” starring Ms. Lawrence as a Russian intelligence operative who specializes in sexual manipulation, ran into stronger-than-expected competition from “Black Panther,” which remained a huge No. 1 at North American theaters in its third weekend. “Black Panther” (Disney) collected about $65.7 million, for a new domestic total of $501.1 million; worldwide ticket sales now stand at roughly $900 million. But the R-rated “Red Sparrow,” which cost Fox at least $100 million to make and market, divided critics and received a lukewarm B grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls. “Red Sparrow” had the hardest time attracting young adults; 79 percent of its audience was over the age of 25, according to Fox. Ms. Lawrence, one of Hollywood’s most popular and highest-paid actresses, was last seen in Darren Aronofsky’s “Mother!” Released in the fall by Paramount, “Mother!” failed in wide release. Before that, Ms. Lawrence co-starred with Chris Pratt in Sony’s expensive “Passengers,” which arrived to a wobbly $14.9 million in 2016. Sony ultimately pushed “Passengers” to about $100 million in domestic ticket sales. The weekend’s other new wide-release movie, “Death Wish” (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer), sold an estimated $13 million in tickets, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. A remake of the 1974 movie of the same name, “Death Wish,” starring Bruce Willis, cost at least $30 million to produce and received withering reviews. The film, which celebrates a vigilante shooter, arrived in the wake of the school massacre in Parkland, Fla. Some people complained on social media that trailers advertising “Death Wish” continued to run in theaters. In other box office news, Hollywood’s awards season came to a close on Sunday with mixed results. Of the nine movies nominated for best picture at the 90th Academy Awards, which ABC will broadcast on Sunday night, seven were released during the last four months, Hollywood’s traditional awards corridor. Steven Spielberg’s newspaper drama “The Post” (20th Century Fox) did the best, collecting about $80 million. Then came “The Shape of Water” (Fox Searchlight) with $57.4 million in domestic ticket sales; “Darkest Hour” (Focus Features) with $55.4 million; and “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” with $52 million. “Lady Bird” (A24) followed with $48.3 million. The least-seen were “Phantom Thread” (Focus), which collected about $20 million, and “Call Me by Your Name” (Sony Pictures Classics), which put together roughly $17 million. By art house standards, all were quite successful. But none of these prestige-minded movies was widely embraced by mainstream ticket buyers — as when the 2011 best picture nominee “Black Swan” collected about $120 million, after adjusting for inflation; or Mr. Spielberg’s “Lincoln” reached nearly $200 million in 2013. The other two films nominated for best picture at Sunday’s Academy Awards arrived outside of the awards corridor and were both domestic blockbusters. “Get Out,” which was released a year ago, generated $176 million in ticket sales. “Dunkirk,” a summer release, had $188.4 million.

Opinion,351," Supported by By Timothy Egan Pope Francis opened the holiest week of the Christian calendar with an admonition to the generation that will own the 21st century. “Dear young people, you have it in you to shout,” he said in his homily. “It is up to you not to keep quiet.” Other voices were more censorious. On “Fox & Friends,” which provides President Trump with steady ration of half-truths and hatreds to fill an empty head and an empty schedule, a co-host had some advice for younger citizens just now learning how to use the wings of democracy. “These 17-year-olds should go back to civics class,” said Pete Hegseth, scowling at the March for Our Lives demonstrators. Actually, civics class has come to them, in the form of a hail of bullets from a weapon of war that is legal because of a broken political system. They’ve been forced, by triage, to learn how to use the tools of democracy that were largely denied them by passive educators. It’s no secret that in the rush to produce adults who are adept at applying science and technology to modern life, we left them ill-trained in the basic duties of citizenship. Nearly a third of Americans cannot name a single branch of government, and almost 40 percent are unable to cite a right guaranteed by the First Amendment. But it’s not the kids who are the doofuses. “There’s a big difference between being ignorant and being stupid,” said Sonia Sotomayor, associate justice of the Supreme Court. She’s been touring the country — 38 states so far — promoting civic competence among the young, a virtue that used to be a bedrock part of American education. “No one is born a citizen,” she said during a stopover in Seattle. “You have to be taught what that means.” The teaching, for a generation that has come of age since the 1999 Columbine massacre, for the 187,000 students who have experienced a shooting on campus during school since then, has been largely do-it-yourself. Only a handful of states require proficiency in civics and government as a condition of graduation. The educational system, with its fear of confrontational topics and its corporate-driven emphasis on STEM, has failed them. But one of the great surprises of the Trump era is the renaissance of civic engagement — at a level of urgency not seen in half a century. It’s a reaction to severe stress on democracy; Trump is both the cause, and leading symptom, of that stress. The awakening started with the revulsion of women — at a president who is credibly accused of sleeping with porn stars while his wife nursed their newborn child and who bragged of sexual assault, and at his daily slights to truth, dignity and other values that mothers teach their children. And now it’s the young’s turn. Critical thinking has arrived at a critical time. They’re not afraid of trolls; they grew up with snark from a screen. So after Laura Ingraham at Fox taunted a Parkland shooting survivor for not getting into his college of choice, the student immediately tweeted out a list of her advertisers. When they threatened to bail, she apologized. “These self-righteous kids screaming at you on television over the weekend aren’t helping out at all,” said Tucker Carlson, another Fox scold. As he knows, they are helping — but just not his side. “First we march, then we vote,” was a leading slogan of the demonstrations. The problem is that Americans are among the least-active voters in developed countries — another consequence, I would argue, of not teaching the manual of democracy in school. And young people are the least likely to vote. “Adults mess up a lot,” Sotomayor told the high school kids in her audience in Seattle. “We don’t have all the answers. We need you to come up with fresher and better ideas.” So today, these young people wonder why even the most obvious legislation, universal background checks on all gun purchases, can’t pass in Congress despite support from 90 percent of the public. They learn quickly that it’s because a single lobby owns the politicians. The obvious solution, which jaded political minds often forget, is to vote the bums out. It’s not complicated. And again, it shouldn’t be a D.I.Y. thing. Let’s teach people how to tell fake news from real news. They do this in Italy, and many universities in the United States have taken it up as well. It should be, like learning road signs before you can get a driver’s license, one of the courses that everyone takes before getting out of high school. Democracies die when citizens feel powerless. The biggest stress test will come if Trump fires the special counsel Robert Mueller. Then, all the people new to the process will see what a constitutional crisis looks like. But thanks to recent, real-life lessons, they’ll recognize it for what it is. And they won’t feel powerless to do something about it. I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@nytegan).

                MARCH 7, 2018 Is the minimum legal voting age of 18 years old fair and appropriate, in your opinion, or should it be lowered? In your view, at what age should people be able to vote in the United States? Why? In “Why We Should Lower the Voting Age to 16,” Laurence Steinberg writes: The young people who have come forward to call for gun control in the wake of the mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., are challenging the tiresome stereotype of American kids as indolent narcissists whose brains have been addled by smartphones. They offer an inspiring example of thoughtful, eloquent protest. Unfortunately, when it comes to electing lawmakers whose decisions about gun control and other issues affect their lives, these high schoolers lack any real power. This needs to change: The federal voting age in the United States should be lowered from 18 to 16. Skeptics will no doubt raise questions about the competence of 16-year-olds to make informed choices in the voting booth. Aren’t young people notoriously impulsive and hotheaded, their brains not fully developed enough to make good judgments? Yes and no. When considering the intellectual capacity of teenagers, it is important to distinguish between what psychologists call “cold” and “hot” cognition. Cold cognitive abilities are those we use when we are in a calm situation, when we are by ourselves and have time to deliberate and when the most important skill is the ability to reason logically with facts. Voting is a good example of this sort of situation. Studies of cold cognition have shown that the skills necessary to make informed decisions are firmly in place by 16. By that age, adolescents can gather and process information, weigh pros and cons, reason logically with facts and take time before making a decision. Teenagers may sometimes make bad choices, but statistically speaking, they do not make them any more often than adults do. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: — At the end of the article, Professor Steinberg writes: The last time the United States lowered the federal voting age was in 1971, when it went from 21 to 18. In that instance, the main motivating force was outrage over the fact that 18-year-olds could be sent to fight in Vietnam but could not vote. Do you agree with the writer’s proposal to lower the voting age to 16 so that those most vulnerable to school shootings have a say in how those shootings are best prevented? Why or why not? — Do you agree that the brain science discussed in the article supports the argument for lowering the legal voting age in the United States? If so, how and why? — What other reasons might you have for lowering the voting age, or for keeping the status quo, and why? — If the voting age were lowered, would you vote? Why or why not?

Washington,353," By SHERYL GAY STOLBERGMARCH 5, 2018 WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a fierce believer in America as a land of immigrants, recently attended a dinner party with a so-called Dreamer. When she pleaded with him to help young undocumented immigrants like herself gain legal status, he hesitated — the House, he said, would pass only legislation that President Trump would sign. He again held back last month after the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee confronted him over their conclusion that Republican aides on the House Intelligence Committee had leaked the private text messages of a senior senator to Fox News. The senators asked for no specific action, and Mr. Ryan offered none. But when Mr. Trump challenged Republican free-trade orthodoxy, Mr. Ryan — a fervent advocate of trade accords for decades — had to respond, albeit four days later and through his press secretary. The speaker, his spokeswoman said, was “extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war” that could be sparked by the president’s steel and aluminum tariffs. On one contentious issue after another — the investigation of Russian interference in American elections, trade, immigration and gun control — a speaker who rose to prominence as an outspoken, almost brash leader, determined to bring his party along with his vision of governance, has receded. Instead, he wields his gavel gingerly.  Even on one of his signature issues, free trade, he has mostly worked behind the scenes to change the president’s mind.  “I think Ryan’s expectations had to be dramatically reduced when Trump became president,” said Peter Wehner, a onetime adviser to former President George W. Bush who is close to the speaker. “I think in a lot of ways he was forced into a defensive posture rather than an offensive posture.” To supporters like Mr. Wehner, Mr. Ryan’s approach is pure pragmatism and smart politics. Facing a divided Republican conference and a mercurial president of his party, they say, he has little choice but to curb some of his own instincts, work behind the scenes and steer Mr. Trump gently. He also must guide House Republicans into a very difficult midterm election campaign, where his main job is to ensure that vulnerable members get re-elected. And those close to Mr. Ryan note that, with the exception of trade, he has not had serious policy disagreements with the president. But Mr. Ryan had modeled himself as a different kind of leader, the youthful face of a new brand of conservatism that was to broaden his party’s appeal and move it beyond 1980s-style Reaganism. His 2012 run for vice president lifted his national profile and fortified his standing. So to critics, the leader once described as “the intellectual center of Republicans in the House” has abandoned principles to hang onto a job he ostensibly never wanted. “I’m tired of saying deep in his heart there is a different Paul Ryan,” said Charles J. Sykes, a conservative commentator and former radio host in Mr. Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin, who for years promoted Mr. Ryan as a potential presidential candidate. Conservative critiques of Mr. Trump, from senators such as Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have gone beyond policy disagreements, to temperament, defenses of democratic institutions and law enforcement, and the conduct of foreign policy. And other Republican leaders are speaking out. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is giving almost daily speeches on the Senate floor pushing for action on a modest but bipartisan bill to fortify the existing background check system for gun purchases. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee and a loud supporter of Mr. Trump, nonetheless scorched his tariffs as “a tax hike the American people don’t need and can’t afford.” Mr. Ryan has repeatedly urged Mr. Trump to abandon the tariffs in private, according to one person familiar with their conversations. In public, he has held his tongue. He declined to be interviewed.  “I always imagined that there was room for an alternative conservative vision to Trumpism, and Paul Ryan was ideally suited to be that leader of a non-Trumpist conservative Republican Party, but he’s chosen not to assume that role,” Mr. Sykes said. “It’s very disappointing to see he’s become so comfortable as an ally and an enabler of Trump.” For Democrats, the speaker’s deference to Mr. Trump is the stuff of ridicule — and a constitutional dereliction of duty by the man three steps from the presidency. “Can you imagine Tip O’Neill or Sam Rayburn or any of the portraits in this gallery saying, ‘I don’t know whether I can be for that, I’ve got to go down the street and ask permission of the president’?” asked Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California, referring to previous speakers whose portraits hang just outside the House chamber. To be sure, Mr. Ryan has had some achievements, notably the rewrite of the federal tax code, which for the speaker marked the realization of a long-held dream. He pushed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act through the House, only to see it die in the Senate. And he helped negotiate a two-year budget deal that should bring some peace to Washington even as it balloons federal spending. “Speaker Ryan has taken on all the challenges of the modern speakership and deftly kept the conference united while advancing an historic conservative agenda,” said Mr. Ryan’s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong. She cited in particular the tax code rewrite and the budget deal’s provisions for “the rebuilding of our depleted military.” Mr. Ryan has not always been so deferential. When Mr. Trump attacked a Mexican-American judge during the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Ryan called the comments the “textbook definition of a racist comment.” When the infamous Access Hollywood tape came out, showing Mr. Trump boasting of sexually assaulting women, Mr. Ryan saw to it that Mr. Trump was disinvited to a rally in Wisconsin.      “They’re from entirely different worlds,” Mr. Wehner said. “That said, Ryan knows he has to deal with Trump, and Trump has probably figured out he has to rely on Ryan.” Now 48, Mr. Ryan became the youngest speaker since 1869 when he was elected to the post in the fall of 2015, replacing John A. Boehner, who was effectively pushed out by conservatives in his unruly conference. Mr. Ryan told his colleagues then that he would accept the speakership only if all factions would unite behind him. To a certain extent, he has succeeded. But in the name of unity, he has governed with a light hand. Last month, the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee confronted Mr. Ryan after they concluded that the House Intelligence Committee had leaked a senator’s private texts — a serious breach of protocol. Although the senators raised concerns about the direction of the committee under its chairman, Devin Nunes of California, Mr. Ryan apparently chose not to intervene.  “The speaker heard the senators on their concerns and encouraged them to take them up directly with their counterparts,” said his spokeswoman, Ms. Strong. If Mr. Ryan is known for one quality, House Republicans say, it is his willingness to listen. Members of his conference view him as “inclusive and fair,” said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania. But in a chamber where 218 votes are required to pass legislation, Mr. Ryan still faces the same fundamental problem as his predecessor: He has difficulty bringing his fractious conference together. That means he must watch his step. Unlike Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, who was speaker from 2007 to 2011, he is not a forceful presence in the House chamber. As speaker, Ms. Pelosi ruled the House with an iron fist, guiding dozens of bills large and small into law. She engineered passage of even doomed bills like a climate change bill that died in the Senate — and likely cost Democrats seats in the 2010 Republican landslide. She emerged as the undisputable face of her caucus, to some members’ chagrin. That is not Mr. Ryan’s style. “It’s hard for anyone be a strong speaker in the traditional sense around here because the speaker is only as strong as his conference allows him to be,” Mr. Dent said. “And because on many issues the speaker cannot get 218 Republican votes, that weakens his position.” Apart from the tax overhaul, that has made for narrow legislative proposals. With Republicans under intense pressure to address gun violence after the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., Mr. Ryan swatted away any suggestion last week that the House would take expansive action. The chamber has already adopted a measure to make modest changes to the national instant background check database, coupled with a measure pushed by the gun lobby to expand the reach of concealed weapons permits. The speaker said Republican leaders now are waiting for the Senate to act. “I’m not going to micromanage this,” he said at a news conference. But there are consequences to Mr. Ryan’s low-key style. Big issues like immigration are languishing with no resolution in sight. Causes that were once Mr. Ryan’s signature fights — an exploding budget deficit, soaring Medicare and Social Security spending and an entrenched welfare state — are on nobody’s must-do list. Even Mr. Boehner, never viewed as a policymaking powerhouse, at least tried to negotiate a “grand bargain” with the White House that was to slow entitlement spending, cut other parts of the government and raise revenue to balance the budget.  Mr. Ryan’s break with Mr. Trump on trade came only after several other Republicans made clear that they were not standing by the president. Republicans are running for re-election on the strength of the economy, hoping that voters credit their policies, especially the tax cuts. But a trade war marked by a spike in consumer prices could jeopardize their survival strategy. To Representative Brian Mast, Republican of Florida and a combat veteran who lost both his legs in Afghanistan, Mr. Ryan’s suggestion that the House wait for the Senate to act on guns is not good enough after the Parkland slaughter. “If we believe that tax reform is a do-or-die issue that we have to get done but we can’t say that protecting our kids is that same kind of issue, then that’s not leadership,” said Mr. Mast, who backed an assault weapons ban after the bloodshed in Parkland. Conservatives, meanwhile, have put Mr. Ryan on notice that he does not have free rein. Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was instrumental in the ouster of Mr. Boehner, and he suggested last month that a misstep on immigration in particular could cost Mr. Ryan his job. “I can say that it is a defining moment for this speaker,” Mr. Meadows said then. “If he gets it wrong, it will have consequences for him.” Follow Sheryl Gay Stolberg on Twitter: @SherylNYT.

Business,354," By TIFFANY HSUMARCH 2, 2018 Delta Air Lines said Friday it might scrap promotional offers for all politically contentious organizations after its removal of a discount for National Rifle Association members drew a swift retaliation from Georgia lawmakers. Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive, said in a memo to employees that the company was “in the process of a review to end group discounts for any group of a politically divisive nature.” On Saturday, as boycott campaigns from gun safety advocates roiled corporate America in the wake of the Florida school shooting that killed 17 people, the airline said it would no longer offer a one-time discount for N.R.A. members traveling to the trade association’s annual meeting in Dallas in May. On Thursday, politicians in Georgia, where Delta is based, struck back at the company in the harshest rebuke yet of a former N.R.A. partner.  The State Senate overwhelmingly approved a version of a tax-relief bill that stripped out a $50 million sales tax exemption highly sought after by Delta. The Georgia House, which, like the Senate, is controlled by Republicans, also approved the change. Nathan Deal, the state’s Republican governor, signed the bill early on Friday.  Mr. Deal said he supported the inclusion of the jet-fuel tax break provision that was removed from the bill, but would still sign it because of its reductions of personal and corporate tax rates. “He is a great friend to Delta,” Mr. Bastian wrote. “I know this action by the state legislature troubled him as it does all of us.” Delta joined United Airlines and more than a dozen other companies in severing ties with the N.R.A. following the shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., last month. Mr. Bastian wrote that Delta made the move after hearing statements from N.R.A. representatives about the massacre, including accusations that the news media was gleefully profiting off the deaths of students.      On Thursday, the families of several victims of the deadly attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 sent a letter to Bass Pro Shops asking it to stop selling assault-style rifles. Earlier this week, Walmart, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Kroger said they would limit firearms sales. Delta’s group rate to the 2018 N.R.A. convention, which the airline said generated a total of 13 ticket sales, was interpreted by many consumers to be an implicit endorsement of the gun group. “That is not the case,” Mr. Bastian wrote. “Our people and our customers have a wide range of views on how to increase safety in our schools and public places, and we are not taking sides,” Mr. Bastian wrote. “Our objective in removing any implied affiliation with the N.R.A. was to remove Delta from this debate.” He stressed in the memo that Delta is “proud and honored” to be based in Atlanta and that the company supports the Second Amendment. “I know it is not comfortable to be caught in a highly emotional debate, and many of you have received questions from customers,” Mr. Bastian wrote to employees. He added: “Our decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale.” Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu. Richard Fausset contributed reporting.

Washington,355," By EILEEN SULLIVANMARCH 28, 2018 WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that the Second Amendment — the right to keep and bear arms — “will never be repealed,” responding to an opinion piece written by a retired Supreme Court justice who called for just that. 
            THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER BE REPEALED! As much as Democrats would like to see this happen, and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens, NO WAY. We need more Republicans in 2018 and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court!         Mr. Trump’s declaration in an early morning tweet came after days of silence on the subject, despite student-organized  marches around the country over the weekend calling for more gun control. On Tuesday, the retired Justice John Paul Stevens wrote an Op-Ed  in The New York Times calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment. “Rarely in my lifetime have I seen the type of civic engagement schoolchildren and their supporters demonstrated in Washington and other major cities throughout the country this past Saturday,” Mr. Stevens wrote. “These demonstrations demand our respect. They reveal the broad public support for legislation to minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society.”  Repealing the Second Amendment would have to be approved by Congress, and there are no signs that such a move is underway.  “It is unequivocally not the Democratic caucus’ position to repeal the Second Amendment,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, said in a statement to The New York Times on Wednesday. “The president has to tweet this because he and the Republicans are reeling.” Mr. Schumer, of New York, said the student marches are having an impact on the traditional argument about gun safety. The choice, he said, is not between gun rights and no gun rights. “Reasonable proposals that adhere to the Second Amendment but improve gun safety such as universal background checks, protective orders and a debate on the assault weapons ban are the way of the future,” Mr. Schumer said. Mr. Stevens retired from the Supreme Court in 2010. He wrote a major dissent about the Second Amendment in one of the court’s hardest-fought decisions. Mr. Stevens argued that the amendment does not protect an individual’s right to own firearms. “That decision — which I remain convinced was wrong and certainly was debatable — has provided the N.R.A. with a propaganda weapon of immense power,” Mr. Stevens wrote on Tuesday, referring to the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobbying group. “Overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the N.R.A.’s ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.”      Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, indicated the administration was not considering a repeal of the Second Amendment. “The president and the administration still fully support the Second Amendment,” Ms. Sanders said on Tuesday in response to a question about Mr. Stevens’s Op-Ed. “We think that the focus has to remain on removing weapons from dangerous individuals, not on blocking all Americans from their constitutional rights.” In his tweet, Mr. Trump also said that Democrats support repealing the Second Amendment, but that has not been the case in Congress, which is only considering modest policy changes on guns. In the 1990s, a Democratic congressman from New York introduced legislation for a repeal, but it did not get any traction. Mr. Trump’s opponent in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton, did not campaign to repeal the Second Amendment.  “We can uphold Second Amendment rights while preventing senseless gun violence,” Mrs. Clinton tweeted in May 2016. Mr. Trump had the support of the N.R.A. early in his campaign for president and has said he is “the biggest fan of the Second Amendment.” After the deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last month, Mr. Trump proposed stricter controls on access to guns, particularly raising the age to purchase an assault weapon to 21 from 18. After a meeting with the N.R.A., Mr. Trump no longer advocated for an age increase. Instead, the White House — with the support of the N.R.A. — says appropriately trained teachers should be armed to respond to future mass shootings. “Gun free zones are proven targets of killers,” Mr. Trump tweeted on March 1. 
            Many ideas, some good & some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House. Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years, a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment!         Arming teachers has been widely criticized, recently by people who gathered for marches for more gun control. At a March for Our Lives demonstration in Anchorage, Alaska, on Saturday, Melanie Anderson, a 44-year-old middle schoolteacher, held up a sign that said “teacher, not sharp shooter.”  ",2018-03-28,0.001934552,Wednesday

Look at the rifles below the M16. Notice that each weapon has the name of a city where a mass shooting took place involving that type of weapon. What do you notice about the guns, and what is your reaction to seeing the military weapon next to the weapons used in the mass shootings? Why did you answer the way you did? Now, read the article “Walmart and Dick’s Raise Minimum Age for Gun Buyers to 21” and answer the following questions:  1.

What did Dick’s other top executives and directors have to say about the decision? 8. What is Dick’s doing to move the conversation beyond social media into the political realm, and why? Finally, tell us more about what you think:  The article reports that under federal law, a person must be at least 21 to buy a handgun, but that 18-year-olds can legally buy semiautomatic rifles and other firearms.

Business,357," By JULIE CRESWELL and MICHAEL CORKERYFEB. 28, 2018 Two of the nation’s leading gun sellers, Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods, took steps on Wednesday to limit their sales of firearms, thrusting themselves into the middle of the polarizing national debate over gun control. Walmart, the biggest gun seller, announced late in the afternoon that it would not sell any gun to anyone under 21 years of age. It also said it would no longer sell items resembling assault-style rifles, including toys and air guns. Early in the day, Dick’s said it was immediately ending sales of all assault-style rifles in its stores. The retailer also said that it would no longer sell high-capacity magazines and would also require any gun buyer to be at least 21, regardless of local laws. Under federal law, a person must be at least 21 to buy a handgun from a firearms dealer. But 18-year-olds can buy semiautomatic rifles and other firearms.  The dual announcements, made two weeks after 17 students and staff members were killed in the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., were among the most significant actions taken on guns by corporate America. Both retailers said their decision were a response to the shooting.  Earlier, President Trump met at the White House with a bipartisan group of lawmakers and called for a series of gun control measures, some of which the National Rifle Association has vigorously opposed. Walmart and Dick’s acted after a number of major companies moved last week to dissociate themselves from the N.R.A. Hertz car rental, MetLife insurance and Delta Air Lines, among others, publicly ended their relationships with the organization. In a news release late Wednesday, Walmart noted that in 2015 it discontinued the sale of  high-powered rifles, including AR-15-style weapons, in its stores in the United States. But at the time, Walmart sidestepped any controversy involving gun politics, attributing its decision to lower customer demand for the military-style rifles. This time, Walmart directly linked its action to the shooting in Florida, saying, “In light of recent events, we’ve taken an opportunity to review our policy on firearm sales.” Top Walmart executives made the decision and then informed the board, a company spokesman said. Walmart sells guns in roughly half of its nearly 4,000 supercenters, the company said, but the sheer scale of its customer base gives its decision significant heft. Every week, more than 150 million people around the country shop at Walmart. Dick’s decision was announced by Edward Stack, the 63-year-old chief executive whose father founded the store in 1948. Mr. Stack made clear that he was deliberately steering his company directly into the storm over gun reform. “When we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset,” Mr. Stack said in an interview. “We love these kids and their rallying cry, ‘Enough is enough.’ It got to us.”  He added, “We’re going to take a stand and step up and tell people our view and, hopefully, bring people along into the conversation.” The decision drew immediate — and passionate — reaction on social media. By midday, the number of Twitter messages containing Dick’s name had jumped 12,000 percent from the average over the previous 10 days, according to Sprout Social, a social media management, advocacy and analytics software platform. 
                When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.             About 79 percent of the tweets had a positive sentiment, Sprout Social said, including supportive messages from Hollywood actors and actresses. But the company’s critics posted their plans to no longer shop at the retailer, some closing their tweets with “#boycott.” Investors did not appear to worry about a backlash, as Dick’s stock spent much of Wednesday trading about 1.8 percent higher before finishing up 0.69 percent.      Mr. Stack said Dick’s hoped to move the conversation beyond social media and into the political realm. As part of its stance, the company is calling on elected officials to pass what it called “common sense gun reform”: raising the minimum age to buy guns to 21, banning assault-type weapons and so-called bump stocks, and conducting broader background checks that include mental-health information and previous interactions with law enforcement. This is not the first time that Dick’s has made changes in response to a school massacre. In 2012, after a gunman killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Dick’s removed assault-style rifles from its main stores. But a few months later, the company began carrying the firearms at its outdoor and hunting retail chain, Field & Stream. As of Wednesday morning, the company said, AR-15-style and other semiautomatic rifles will no longer be sold in its 35 Field & Stream stores or on its websites. And this time, Mr. Stack added, the changes will be permanent. Mr. Stack said the retailer had begun scouring its purchase records shortly after the identity of the suspected Parkland killer, Nikolas Cruz, became known. The company soon discovered that it had legally sold a gun to Mr. Cruz in November, though it was not the type used in the school shooting.  “But it came to us that we could have been a part of this story,” Mr. Stack said. “We said, ‘We don’t want to be a part of this any longer.’” That response raised rounds of discussions with the company’s top executives and its directors, all of whom backed the decision to take a stand, Mr. Stack said. He said Dick’s remained a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment and would continue to sell a variety of sport and hunting firearms. Although he has never been a member of the N.R.A., Mr. Stack said, he is a gun owner and enjoys trapshooting. But when it comes to selling guns to individuals under 21 or stocking assault-style rifles, Mr. Stack said, his company is done. “We don’t want to be a part of a mass shooting,” he said. The company said that it had not decided what to do with its inventory of assault-style rifles but that they would not be sold in the marketplace. Legal experts said they saw no likely challenges to Dick’s decision to stop selling assault-style rifles. But the decision to stop selling weapons to anyone under 21, however, could be tested in court. Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the School of Law of the University of California, Los Angeles, said Dick’s could be challenged in lawsuits claiming a violation of laws that bar age discrimination. Although federal civil rights laws do not apply, some states, including New York, prohibit businesses from denying goods and services on the basis of age. “Don’t be surprised if an aggressive attorney general of a gun-friendly state brings an age-discrimination claim against Dick’s,” Professor Winkler wrote in an email response to questions. The company said that it believed its decision was in accordance with the law and that it was instituting the policy immediately. Matthew Haag contributed reporting.

National,358," By JACEY FORTINFEB. 28, 2018 A teacher at a high school in Dalton, Ga., was arrested on Wednesday after he barricaded himself in his classroom and fired at least one gunshot through a window, the police said. Bruce Frazier, the spokesman for the Dalton Police Department, said that no students were hit and that he was aware of only one injury: A student hurt her ankle while running through the halls. The police identified the teacher as Jesse Randall Davidson, 53. They said that he appeared to have locked the door to his classroom at Dalton High School and was alone there when students tried to enter shortly before noon. The principal, Steve Bartoo, was called to the classroom and said he used a key to open the door. “I attempted to enter the classroom and he slammed the door,” Mr. Bartoo said at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon, adding that Mr. Davidson told him to go away. “He had some nonsensical noises that were made as well.”  After that, Mr. Frazier said: “Mr. Davidson apparently fired a shot from a handgun through an exterior window of the classroom. It did not appear that it was aimed at anybody. Obviously it broke out the window, and at that point the school went into lockdown.”  A junior at the high school, Wesley Caceres, 16, said in a phone interview that he heard about the “code red” lockdown over the intercom. On his way to take shelter in a classroom, Wesley filmed a video of students running frantically through the hallways.

We okay !!! pic.twitter.com/U4UwgYGHdV         “Our teachers started getting terrified, and we got terrified,” Wesley said, adding that he called his mother to tell her he loved her. Mr. Davidson stayed in his classroom for at least a half-hour before being taken into police custody without incident, Mr. Frazier said. Wesley and other students were eventually evacuated to a nearby convention center. Mr. Davidson was being held at the Whitfield County Jail, Cliff Cason, assistant police chief, said at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. Later, the police said, Mr. Davidson was charged with several counts including: aggravated assault; carrying weapon on school grounds; terroristic threats; and reckless conduct.      “This is a very egregious act that took place,” Chief Cason said. The school resource officer on duty was at the nearby middle school when the episode began, Chief Cason said. But he quickly went to the high school, where he spoke to Mr. Davidson and “was able to persuade him to come outside and surrender,” Chief Cason added. Mr. Bartoo said that school policy did not allow guns on campus. He said that Mr. Davidson had been a “very good teacher” who was “well thought of,” adding that he had been employed as a teacher there since 2004. The police said they were still investigating how Mr. Davidson got a handgun into the school and what motivated him to fire it. The episode came two weeks after 17 people were killed by a gunman at a high school in Parkland, Fla. President Trump has since suggested that more teachers should be armed in order to protect students, sparking fierce debates over the role that educators should be expected to play.

Opinion,359," Supported by The Conversation By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens Gail Collins: Bret, did you find the Stormy Daniels interview sort of … boring? I did, and it seems like a tribute to Donald Trump that I could be listening to a woman talking about how she swatted his rear end with a magazine that had his picture on the front and think, “Well, at least he had underwear on.” Don’t get me wrong: Her claim about the guy who admired her baby and said, “It would be a shame if something happened to her mom,” was definitely worth talking about. And if her hush money counts as a campaign donation, that could be a huge issue. It’s just that we now have a president whose sleaze rating is so high it’s hard to get shocked by anything. Bret Stephens: Exactly. It’s boring because nothing about this president scandalizes us anymore. I can remember when news of Bill Clinton’s alleged affair with Gennifer Flowers broke when he was running for president in 1992. Conservatives erupted: The man was not fit to sit in the Oval Office! Nowadays it’s a different story. Right-wing political culture, including the institutional Christian right, has been pornogrified. The Stormy Daniels affair isn’t a shock to that culture; it’s a representation of it. This is the bed conservatives made, so to speak, when they adopted Trump as one of their own, so they shouldn’t be surprised by anyone who turns up in there with them. If Trump were smarter, he would confess to the affair, maybe have a Jimmy Swaggart “I have sinned against you, my Lord” moment. That way he improves his ratings and probably lessens any legal jeopardy. Gail: Another point on the Trump-is-so-terrible-nothing’s-shocking-anymore barometer: Stormy Daniels was only one of at least half-dozen weird/scary stories coming out of the White House in recent days. I know this lacks a certain pizazz, but I was bowled over by the president’s response to the spending package. The fact that Congress actually passed one at all seemed worthy of at least a minor celebration: Trump wine for all! But instead, he reacted as if they’d done something wild and crazy behind his back — when his negotiators were there for the whole deal. Bret: Here’s The Times’s account of how Trump responded. “Senior advisers spent Thursday telling reporters that he would sign” the bill. “Then early Friday, on a morning when he watched a fierce backlash to the measure play out on Fox News, Mr. Trump seemed to hesitate, tweeting angrily about the lack of wall funding.” I suppose there are two ways of interpreting this. One is that “Fox & Friends” runs the country and we’re all gonna die. The second is that the president is nervous about his base and feels compelled to manufacture a drama in order to keep them in line. Hence the second-most interesting line in the Times’s article: “Amy Kremer, a Tea Party activist who helped found Women for Trump, tweeted, ‘I’m done.’ ” Gail: I really am prepared to believe he didn’t know the wall wasn’t in the bill. He probably didn’t even ask. When his top people are sitting in the Oval Office, the conversation goes something like this: AIDE: I have some good news: The whole spending package is almost done. PRESIDENT: Did you hear what Oprah said about me? Bret: Hehe. Gail:  The two things a Republican president is supposed to do are cut taxes and try to cut domestic spending. Which generally doesn’t work, but you expect there’d be an effort at least. Bret: The operative phrase on right-wing blogs is always something like: “The swamp wins again. Trump surrenders.” This is also known as “compromise.” Republicans got a $61 billion increase in military spending, the biggest annual increase in 15 years. Democrats got some of their own priorities funded. This is more or less how things are going to work when you don’t have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. The correct conservative response ought to be to nod, shrug and get on with life. But it won’t work that way, because right-wing ideologues have convinced themselves that they own Washington and that any policy victory that is less than 100 percent complete is a sellout to the nefarious forces of liberalism and globalism. Wouldn’t it be something if Trump had gone out there and said, “This administration is prepared to take two-thirds of the loaf and that’s how politics in a democracy ought to be”? He can’t because he is unwilling and unable to move beyond the furies of his base. Gail: Now that is the kind of sensible, real-world answer I’ve come to expect from you. Personally, I’d love to have a fight about the defense budget, and the whole idea that we’re supposed to be the world’s sole policeman. A country capable of putting Donald Trump in the White House should not be trusted with that kind of responsibility, and I’m tired of paying for it. But that’s a rant — please ignore. The other White House weirdness has been the ever-shifting cast of characters. I guess there’s no reason for us to worry about the way his lawyers have been racing through the revolving doors, but we’re only one Fox broadcast away from Judge Jeanine as attorney general. Which allows me to once again express amazement at having come to a moment in history where Jeff Sessions is a somewhat sympathetic character. Bret: We really should have a longer conversation one day about the defense budget, which I would double if it were it up to me. The departures of Gary Cohn, Rex Tillerson and H. R. McMaster confirm the central truth of the Trump presidency: He’s an incompetent executive. He offers no loyalty to his subordinates but expects flattery from them in return. He provides no direction but refuses to take direction when it is offered to him. People call him the chaos president, which he thinks is a compliment because it hints at the possibility that there’s method to the madness. There isn’t. It’s just a personality disorder with command authority over nuclear weapons. On second thought, maybe your point about Trump having control over the Pentagon budget is a good one. Ever consider moving to Costa Rica? Gail: I never could buy the “I’m going to Canada” thing. Although Costa Rica does have better weather. Still, it’d be like having a contractor tell you the gas is leaking in the basement and saying, “Well, then, I’m going to visit my sister in Cincinnati.” We’ve got to stay here and fix the problem. Speaking of which, I know we’re in agreement about the gun issue, and nearly everybody was moved by the marches over the weekend. But I still do wonder why the country was so totally mobilized by what happened in Florida when the response to previous disasters — for God’s sake, grade-school kids in Newtown — was so comparatively muted. Do you think it was because these survivors are older and so articulate? Or that having Trump in the White House made everyone more sensitive to moral issues? I even wondered if it was because this time it happened in a political barometer-state like Florida. Bret: All of the above, I suspect. The Parkland students have spoken out to magnificent effect, something the Newtown children were simply too young to do for themselves. I also get the sense that the pace of these atrocities has accelerated. Before Parkland it was the church shooting in Sutherland Springs. Before that, the concertgoers in Las Vegas. Before that, the shooting of Representative Steve Scalise at the baseball field near Washington. Maybe, at some level of the national psyche, we understood that we we’re coming dangerously close to accepting these atrocities as an accepted fact of life. Defining deviancy down for the sake of Wayne LaPierre’s N.R.A.? No, thank you. Gail: Whenever I feel depressed I remind myself that the N.R.A. is having its worst year ever. Bret: One of the paradoxes of the Trump presidency is that it has galvanized the country in all sorts of positive ways. From Charlottesville to l’Affaire Stormy, he has brought to the surface all sorts of ugliness that is simply unignorable. For instance, do you think the #MeToo movement would have taken hold the way it did if he weren’t in the White House? Gail: It’s a necessary stage in women’s progress — socially and economically — so we’d have gotten there anyway. But having the worst-possible male image in the White House probably propelled things forward faster. I guess you could say he’s so bad he’s making us better. Bret: As political writers, too, I suspect. Sometimes I wonder: After Trump, will we ever have this kind of material to work with? I mean, that’s assuming there is an “after Trump.” Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

President Trump said on Monday that he believed he would have run into the Florida high school where a gunman opened fire this month, even if he’d been unarmed. Stephen Colbert reacted with disbelief to that statement — then he bore down and reminded his audience that the president avoided military service during the Vietnam War. “O.K. There’s a lot in there that I doubt, but the part I really don’t believe is that he can run.” — STEPHEN COLBERT “Look, sir, we already know how you react to combat situations. You got five deferments from Vietnam. What are you gonna do, run in there and stab ’em with your bone spurs?” — STEPHEN COLBERT Seth Meyers was incredulous too, but for a different reason. “I gotta say, I find it hard to believe Trump would voluntarily run inside a place of education. The only way you would run inside is if a reporter asked you a question outside.” — SETH MEYERS Many companies have decided to cut ties with the National Rifle Association after the shooting in Parkland, Fla., provoked a public outcry over gun violence. “Several businesses have canceled their partnership with the N.R.A. over the past week, including United Airlines. You know you messed up when the company that dragged the guy off the plane is like, ‘You’re making us look bad.’” — JIMMY FALLON “With the Olympics over, 90 countries have departed South Korea. Yep, 90 groups waving goodbye — or as the N.R.A. calls those, sponsors.” — JIMMY FALLON Trevor Noah thought carrying a gun sounded like a pretty smart way to get yourself a discount. “I’m less surprised that corporations are canceling N.R.A. discounts than I am that corporations were giving them discounts in the first place. Like, how does the N.R.A. even get discounts? Were all the N.R.A. members just there like, [brandishes weapon] ‘We’d like a discount.’” — TREVOR NOAH “A new CNN poll has found that Democrats have a 16-point lead over Republicans in a generic congressional ballot. Which means that with a little hard work and some elbow grease, they can still blow this thing.” — SETH MEYERS “A couple in North Carolina recently had their wedding at a Whole Foods store — which explains why, when the officiant asked if there were any objections, someone said, ‘Twelve dollars for milk!’” — SETH MEYERS “At the annual meeting of conservatives called CPAC, a woman who criticized Donald Trump was booed and escorted out by security. Yeah, this is the third time this has happened to Melania.” — CONAN O’BRIEN In his first broadcast since the shooting in Florida, Jimmy Fallon expressed solidarity with the students pushing for gun control legislation and said he would join them at the March for Our Lives, a protest in Washington scheduled for March 24. Steve Harvey thinks he could maybe do James Corden’s job for him. Bruce Willis, whose latest film, “Death Wish,” is in theaters, appears on “The Tonight Show” on Tuesday. A new TV series dramatizes the still-unsolved murders of Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur, the rappers who were famously gunned down in the 1990s. And its creators seem to be fairly certain about who was responsible for the killings.  See More » ",2018-02-27,0.001887562,Tuesday

                MARCH 6, 2018 Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Fifty years ago this month, amid the tumult of the 1960s, thousands of Chicano students from Los Angeles high schools walked out of class to protest racism and failing schools. “I was pretty beat down,” recalled Bobby Verdugo, who was one of the student organizers. “I didn’t think I would amount to much. That’s what teachers were telling me.” As Mr. Verdugo, 67, and other veterans of the Chicano walkouts made the rounds of events at schools here recently, to mark the anniversary, students told them about their own intentions to walk out of class next week, in solidarity with student activists across the country who have called for protests for gun control in the aftermath of the shooting in Parkland, Fla. “I couldn’t help but reflect back,” he said. “Before us, high school kids had never done that en masse.”  With the gun protests planned for next week, on March 14, commentators have invoked the historic parallels to the 1960s, when students protested against the Vietnam War and in favor of civil rights. The history of his own movement, Mr. Verdugo said, is often forgotten.  Writing in The Los Angeles Times recently, Gustavo Arellano, a columnist, said: “Those young people helped launch the Chicano movement in Southern California and created a generation of leaders.” Mr. Arellano worries that the national news media coverage of the Parkland-inspired activists will ignore the Chicano walkouts, and focus instead on the youth movements against the Vietnam War and segregation in the South, and more recent youth-led protests against President Trump’s immigration policies. But in Los Angeles this week no one is ignoring that history. Los Angeles schools have held a number of events, including a re-enactment on Monday of a famous meeting in 1968 between Cesar Chavez, the Chicano labor leader, and Robert F. Kennedy. “Chicano history was not separate from American history, it was a part of American history,” Mr. Verdugo said. One of the sparks for the protests here in 1968 was a high dropout rate among Latino students. And Mr. Verdugo, who was failing in school, left for good after the protests. But later that year he was admitted to U.C.L.A. under an affirmative action program. “I walked out in March, dropped out in May, and in October I walked on to the campus of U.C.L.A.,” he said. He never graduated, but years later earned a degree from another university and went on to a long career in social work.

Express,362," By MAGGIE ASTORMARCH 1, 2018 So far this awards season, the #MeToo movement has drawn almost as much attention as the nominees. Seas of black clothing and “Time’s Up” pins have dominated red carpets, and hosts have given shout-outs from the stage. On Thursday, the internet found itself in a tizzy when many news outlets reported, based on an ABC News interview, that Jimmy Kimmel, host of this year’s Oscars, would not do that. But, as is often the case on the internet, those reports were misleading. Asked explicitly by a Variety interviewer whether he would discuss #MeToo, Mr. Kimmel said, “It’ll be a part of the show.” And when Rebecca Keegan of Vanity Fair asked if he planned to include “questions or bits that address Time’s Up,” he responded unequivocally, “I do, yes.” The confusion stemmed from an ABC News interview broadcast Thursday, in which Mr. Kimmel said: “This show is not about reliving people’s sexual assaults — it’s an awards show for people who have been dreaming about maybe winning an Oscar for their whole lives. And the last thing I want to do is ruin that for someone who is, you know, nominated for, you know, best leading actress or best supporting or best director or cinematographer or whatever, by making it unpleasant.”  He added that he could not “stop any bad behavior with my jokes.” Numerous publications, from HuffPost to Glamour, took that to mean Mr. Kimmel would not discuss #MeToo at all. Among the most shared articles was Glamour’s, which was headlined “Jimmy Kimmel Won’t Mention the #MeToo or Time’s Up Movements While Hosting the Oscars.”  Ms. Keegan, the Vanity Fair reporter, tweeted that the Glamour article was “inaccurate and designed to get your rage clicks.” Mr. Kimmel, the host of “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on ABC, has not shied from hot-button topics in the past. Over the last year in particular, he has spoken passionately on his own show about issues like health care and gun control.      In an emotional monologue in May, he described his newborn son’s emergency heart surgery and said, “No parent should ever have to decide if they can afford to save their child’s life.” In October, he wept as he implored lawmakers to confront gun violence. And last week, he went fiercely after conspiracy theorists who claim that the survivors of the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla., are actors. “If the answer is ‘Yes, I do believe that,’ I have some bad news for you: You’re crazy,” he said. “You’re a crazy person. Your brain is not functioning, and I’m worried about you.” In fact, in the same ABC News interview broadcast Thursday, Mr. Kimmel said it was “almost necessary now” for comedians like himself to address serious issues. The executives behind the Academy Awards said last week that they wanted to keep the event focused on the films and artists being honored. Channing Dungey, ABC’s president of entertainment, said of #MeToo that she “would love for every award recipient to not feel like they have to acknowledge it independently.” But none of those executives suggested that the ceremony avoid the subject entirely. And regardless of what Mr. Kimmel does or does not say, the subject of sexual misconduct in Hollywood is virtually certain to be a major topic of discussion on the floor of the Dolby Theater. At the Golden Globes in January, many attendees wore black in an arena normally dominated by more colorful fashion statements. And at the Grammys three weeks later, white roses were the symbol of solidarity.

Business,363," Supported by By Michael M. Grynbaum A longtime analyst for Fox News is leaving the network, saying that he could not “in good conscience” remain with an organization that, he argued, “is now wittingly harming our system of government for profit.” In a searing farewell note sent to colleagues on Tuesday, Ralph Peters, a Fox News strategic analyst and a retired lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, castigated the network for its coverage of President Trump and the rhetoric of its prime-time hosts. “In my view, Fox has degenerated from providing a legitimate and much-needed outlet for conservative voices to a mere propaganda machine for a destructive and ethically ruinous administration,” Colonel Peters wrote in his message, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. “Over my decade with Fox, I long was proud of the association,” he added. “Now I am ashamed.” Without citing them by name, Colonel Peters, 65, wrote that Fox News’s prime-time anchors “dismiss facts and empirical reality to launch profoundly dishonest assaults on the F.B.I., the Justice Department, the courts, the intelligence community (in which I served) and, not least, a model public servant and genuine war hero such as Robert Mueller.” “I cannot be part of the same organization, even at a remove,” he wrote. Fox News responded on Tuesday by saying it was “extremely proud of our top-rated prime-time hosts and all of our opinion programming.” “Ralph Peters is entitled to his opinion despite the fact that he’s choosing to use it as a weapon in order to gain attention,” the network said in a statement. Colonel Peters, who appeared regularly on Fox News and the Fox Business Network — including as recently as Monday morning — spent more than two decades in the Army, eventually specializing in Russian intelligence. He began appearing as a television commentator in the late 1990s, and signed an exclusive contract with Fox in 2008. Typically hawkish in his views, Colonel Peters supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and was a strong proponent of confronting President Vladimir Putin of Russia. He was a fervent critic of former President Barack Obama, deriding his foreign policy as weak, and was briefly suspended by the network in 2015 after using a vulgarity to describe Mr. Obama during an appearance on Fox Business. In an email interview on Tuesday, Colonel Peters wrote that his letter had been “intended for internal consumption,” adding: “I am not trying to grandstand. Fox was good to me for many years.” He said he informed Fox News on March 1 that he did not plan to renew his contract, which expires toward the end of this month. “As a retired military officer,” he said, “I simply could not continue with Fox in good conscience.” Fox News’s commentary shows, like “Hannity” and “Fox & Friends,” have become stalwart defenders of Mr. Trump and his administration, often criticizing Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, and law enforcement agencies that have been investigating possible ties between the president’s associates and Russian interference into the 2016 election. Fox News remains the No. 1 cable news network despite recent changes in its prime-time lineup. Since 2017, the conservative pundits Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham have replaced Megyn Kelly, who left for NBC News, and Bill O’Reilly, who was fired after a harassment scandal. Colonel Peters’s message to his colleagues, which was first reported by BuzzFeed News, included the caveat that not every Fox News host is “a propaganda mouthpiece — some have shown courage.” Colonel Peters also described his respect for colleagues at the Fox Business Network and reporters at Fox News, whom he called “talented professionals in a poisoned environment.” An author of historical fiction and spy thrillers who writes a regular column in The New York Post, Colonel Peters gained notice in recent weeks after he called for an assault weapons ban in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla.

National,364," By ALEXANDER BURNS and JONATHAN MARTINMARCH 25, 2018 The passionate gun control rallies Saturday that brought out large crowds around the country sent a vivid signal that the issue is likely to play a major role in the 2018 midterm elections, and that Republicans could find themselves largely on the defensive on gun issues for the first time in decades. The gun debate could play out very differently in House and Senate races, as Republicans strain to save suburban congressional districts where gun control is popular, and Democrats defend Senate seats in red states where the Second Amendment is sacrosanct. But, in a year of extraordinary political intensity, and in the first national election of the Trump presidency, Republican and Democratic leaders say the gun issue appears to have become a potent rallying point for voters opposed to Mr. Trump and fed up with what they see as Washington’s indifference to mass shootings. The scale of demonstrations over the weekend was reminiscent of the Women’s March, earlier in Mr. Trump’s presidency, and underscored the intense energy of activists on the left ahead of the fall campaign. The commitment of the young march organizers to keep the issue front and center makes it unlikely to fade before November. But they are certain to face considerable resistance from pro-gun forces, particularly the National Rifle Association, which has formidable financial resources at its disposal and a long record of successfully mobilizing conservatives and helping win elections.  Still, Republicans have already been struggling to keep their footing in densely populated suburbs where Mr. Trump is unpopular and the N.R.A. is an object of widespread scorn. The gun issue appears likely to deepen Republicans’ problems in these areas, further cleaving moderate, pocketbook-minded suburban voters from the party’s more hard-line rural base and raising the risks for Republicans in swing House districts around the country.  Gun control may be a complicated issue for Democrats, too, because of the makeup of the Senate races on the ballot in November. If Democrats have a path to capturing the House through mainly moderate, well-educated districts, they are also defending Senate seats in strongly conservative states, like West Virginia and North Dakota, and in Republican-leaning states like Missouri and Indiana, where pro-gun positions have long been safe political terrain. But several prominent Republicans warned on Sunday that the party could end up alienating groups that tend to vote for candidates to the right of center if they are seen as unresponsive to the rising outcry around guns. In an atmosphere of frustration with Washington, inaction on guns could add to voters’ anger at entrenched lawmakers there. 
                All 435 House seats are up for grabs, but only about 48 seats are considered competitive.             Gov. John Kasich, Republican of Ohio, warned in a CNN interview on Sunday that voters “do want changes” on gun policy and Republicans were ignoring them at their peril. “People should absolutely be held accountable at the ballot box,” said Mr. Kasich, a critic of Mr. Trump who is contemplating a run for president in 2020. It is not only the Republican Party’s dwindling moderate wing that sees danger in the gun issue. Dan Eberhart, an energy executive and major conservative donor, said Republicans risked driving away suburban voters if they did not do more to defy the N.R.A. Mr. Eberhart pointed to Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican with an A-plus N.R.A. rating for supporting the organization’s agenda. Mr. Scott, who is contemplating a bid for the Senate seat held by the Democrat Bill Nelson, signed incremental new gun regulations after last month’s shooting in Parkland, Fla., over the N.R.A.’s objections. “Republicans are going to have to move a little to get 51 percent-plus in elections, and the N.R.A. will have to deal with it,” Mr. Eberhart said. “The N.R.A. is really out of step with suburban G.O.P. voters.”  While Democrats have little hope the demonstrations will lead quickly to legislation, they predict the broad-based outpouring of protest will increase pressure on Republicans. Addressing reporters on Sunday, Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader and Democrat of New York, said even Republicans in the “stranglehold” of the N.R.A. must be “smelling the change in the air.” “This wasn’t Democrats only,” Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, said of the protests. “This was people just sick and tired of a ruling party that refuses to take action on something so morally urgent.” Public opinion polls show powerful support for a range of gun measures, with overwhelming support for stricter background checks for gun purchasers and a smaller majority favoring an outright ban on assault-style weapons. A Fox News poll conducted last week found that three in five voters supported a ban on military-style weapons, while about nine in 10 supported universal background checks. 
                Republicans need to win nine senate races to keep a majority, and Democrats need to win 28 to take it away. Here’s a look at the chances of each outcome.             But the same poll found scant optimism among voters that Congress would act in accordance with their preferences: Only about a fifth of voters thought it was highly likely Congress would act. The doubters are probably correct: There is relatively little time left on the congressional calendar this year, and the Republicans who control the House and Senate have shown no great appetite for tackling gun control. The $1.3 trillion spending bill that Mr. Trump signed on Friday included modest school safety measures and improvements to the background-checks system, but it did not include a number of more ambitious and popular measures, like raising the age requirement for purchasers of assault weapons. And while the Justice Department announced last week that it would try to follow through on a promise to ban so-called bump stocks through regulation, Mr. Trump has not indicated that he intends to take any further executive action to address the issue. Against a backdrop of plodding debate in Washington, a number of Democratic candidates in important races have already made prominent appeals to voters on the issue of gun violence, combining support for new gun restrictions with rhetorical denunciations of the N.R.A. Several of the Democrats campaigning most assertively on firearm regulation are also competing in areas recently afflicted by gun massacres. In Nevada, Steve Sisolak, a leading Democratic candidate for governor, vowed in his first television commercial to “take on the N.R.A.” A member of the Clark County Commission, which includes Las Vegas, Mr. Sisolak was among the most visible officials responding to the mass shooting in October, which left 58 people dead and hundreds wounded.  Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democratic congressional candidate in South Florida, in a district not far from Parkland, said voters were fired up because of their horror at mass shootings and their outrage at congressional inaction. “This is a symbol of everything that is wrong right now, that is happening in Washington, D.C.,” said Ms. Mucarsel-Powell, who is challenging Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Miami Republican. Ms. Mucarsel-Powell, who marched against gun violence in Key West on Saturday, has aired commercials describing her personal experience with gun violence: When she was 24, her father was shot and killed in Ecuador. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     Other Democrats have been more timid on gun issues, particularly in more rural and heavily white, working-class districts where broad gun rights are more popular. When Democrats won an upset victory in a Pennsylvania special election  this month, in a heavily conservative congressional district outside Pittsburgh, they did so by nominating a distinctly moderate candidate, Conor Lamb, who favored improving the background checks system but did not back other popular gun restrictions. Val DiGiorgio, the chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, said that while Democrats won that special election, the race had shown “the passion of Second Amendment supporters.” But Mr. DiGiorgio said voters were also seeking remedies for gun violence. “It’s clear that Americans on all sides of the debate are looking for solutions,” Mr. DiGiorgio said. But the energy in the Democratic base is with those who favor gun restrictions. While the colorful signs and pleading speeches of the students drew attention on Saturday, state and local Democratic parties across the country also used the marches to register voters and sign up volunteers. In Florida, volunteers circulated at protests in over 30 cities, passing out “commit to vote” cards that the party can later use for voter turnout purposes. And in Virginia, Democrats descended on the cities where buses were departing to the Washington march to register voters.  The efforts were not confined to large liberal and swing states. In Columbia, S.C., the local Democratic Party used the march in the state’s capital to sign up voters for what could be a competitive governor’s race this fall. The liberal group Indivisible also used the protests to kick off a campaign pressuring members of Congress during the legislative recess. Jim Hobart, a Republican pollster, said the marches illustrated the enormous energy of the Democratic base and revealed generational changes in the electorate that Republicans will have to grapple with. “As we have seen in special elections, Democratic enthusiasm is already very high and the gun issue just adds to that,” Mr. Hobart said, noting that students in his hometown Atlanta had traveled by bus for 10 hours to join the march in Washington. “These same students are much more likely to not just vote, but volunteer.” A version of this article appears in print on March 26, 2018, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Passion of Gun Protests Testing G.O.P. ’s Hold on Swing Suburbs.

                MARCH 23, 2018 Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Delaine Eastin, a former Democratic member of the State Assembly and onetime superintendent of public education, is one of nearly 30 candidates running to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown. California Today is planning occasional Q. and A. sessions with candidates for office, and we’re starting with Ms. Eastin. The interview has been edited and condensed. Q. How much do you see yourself continuing with — or not — programs and policies put in place under Governor Brown? A. Jerry Brown has very high marks when it comes to financial responsibility and he’s a strong environmental governor. Always has been. I don’t give him as high marks in education. I give his father the high marks in education. His father was amazing. Having said that, Jerry Brown has a lot to be proud of, and there’s a lot we should continue and I will. Q. How big a problem is poverty and homelessness in California? A. It’s enormous. In your life have you ever seen as many homeless children? Twenty-five percent of the homeless in America are in California. We need to urgently get these children off the street — and their mothers as well.  Q. Is this something the governor has not paid enough attention to? A. He should have declared a public emergency. Some communities are doing things. Sacramento is taking steps. Los Angeles is taking steps. There is not enough being done statewide. The governor should really be stepping up and doing things to prevent this terrible tragedy.  Q. How do you feel about the high-speed train proposed for Los Angeles to San Francisco? A. I hope we can find a way to do it. But I can’t commit to doing it if we don’t find a revenue stream. It really is saying we’ll build a big expensive thing when we can’t afford to give kids health care, we can’t afford to educate kids. There are things that are more important than high-speed rail. If we have to walk away, we will. Still, I’m one who believes that where there’s a will, there’s a way. The news and stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state).

California rally locations are listed here. A counterprotest, called the Defend the Second Amendment Rally, will take place at the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles. A recent poll of California voters indicates that support for stricter gun laws has climbed 15 percentage points, to about 70 percent, since last month’s deadly shooting in Parkland, Fla. And the report, from the Public Policy Institute of California, suggests that Republicans are joining Democrats in their support for a change to gun laws. The institute found that 87 percent of Democrats thought gun laws should be stricter, and that 48 percent of Republicans agreed — up from 28 percent last year.

Metro,366," By SHANE GOLDMACHERFEB. 21, 2018 Representative Claudia Tenney, a first-term Republican from Central New York, said in a radio interview on Wednesday that “so many” mass murderers “end up being Democrats.” Democrats immediately condemned her remarks, which came a week after 17 people were killed at a high school in Parkland, Fla., and called on her to apologize for politicizing gun tragedies. One of Ms. Tenney’s colleagues in the House, Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democrat of Virginia, wrote on Twitter that she “owes America a sincere and abject apology.” And her expected Democratic challenger this year, State Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi, said in his own Twitter post that her “toxic rhetoric” was “a new low” and that “inserting politics into a national tragedy is beyond the pale & disgusting.” 
            First, @RepTenney said Democrats are un-American. Now this. This toxic rhetoric is shameful and a new low even for Ms. Tenney. Inserting politics into a national tragedy is beyond the pale & disgusting. She should apologize now to spare our region any more national embarrassment. https://t.co/o85LNfoufP         It is not clear that any group keeps a list of the political affiliation of mass killers. The Southern Poverty Law Center released a report this month that counted 100 people killed or injured by “alleged perpetrators influenced by the so-called ‘alt-right’” between 2014 and 2018.  Some individual shootings have appeared politically motivated, at least in part. James Hodgkinson, who opened fire last year on Republicans during their practice for an annual bipartisan congressional baseball game, had written anti-Trump and anti-Republican remarks on social media ahead of the attack. He wounded several people, including Representative Steve Scalise, a top Republican lawmaker, though only the gunman died in that shooting.  Ms. Tenney made her sweeping claim on the “Focus on the State Capitol” radio program hosted by Fred Dicker.      Ms. Tenney said she feared lawful gun owners “are going to be targeted now” even though “in their demographic they have the least amount of crimes of virtually any other demographic.” Mr. Dicker jumped in: “But they tend to be Republican. They tend to be white. Most gun crimes are occurring in what’s euphemistically called the inner cities involving minorities and they’re the ones the Democrats generally are going to bend over backwards to protect.” Ms. Tenney eventually continued, “Obviously there’s a lot of politics in it. And it’s interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats. But the media doesn’t talk about that either.” In a statement on Wednesday night, Ms. Tenney elaborated but didn’t provide information about her claim: “I am fed up with the media and liberals attempting to politicize tragedies and demonize law-abiding gun owners and conservative Americans every time there is a horrible tragedy. While we know the perpetrators of these atrocities have a wide variety of political views, my comments are in response to a question about the failure to prosecute illegal gun crime. I will continue to stand up for law-abiding citizens who are smeared by anti-gun liberal elitists.” Ms. Tenney, a former state legislator, was elected to Congress in 2016, and her district is expected to be among the most hotly contested in New York this fall.

Metro,367," By NICHOLAS BOGEL-BURROUGHSMARCH 19, 2018 ITHACA — With images of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting still fresh, a federal judge ordered on Monday that a former Cornell University student undergo a psychiatric examination after authorities found a military-style rifle, a homemade bomb and other tactical equipment in his apartment, blocks away from the Ivy League campus. The F.B.I. and the local police are still investigating the former student, Maximilien R. Reynolds, 20, and what he planned to do with his weapons — if he planned to do anything with them at all. A Walmart employee called the police after Mr. Reynolds purchased ammunition, knives and other tools the employee deemed suspicious, and the tip led authorities to raid Mr. Reynolds’s studio apartment in the Collegetown neighborhood on March 7. Inside, the police found a wide array of weapons and survival gear that left them stunned: an AR-15-style rifle, a shrapnel bomb fashioned from a firework, more than 300 rounds of ammunition for various guns, a bulletproof vest, a homemade silencer, trauma supplies and food rations.  “Collectively all of these items certainly suggest a specific recipe for large-scale destruction,” said Peter Tyler, Ithaca’s police chief, who praised the work of local and federal investigators. Mr. Reynolds had been on leave from Cornell since after the 2016 fall semester and was taking classes at a local community college. After the raid on his apartment, Mr. Reynolds voluntarily sought treatment at a hospital. He was arrested and charged on Thursday. At a hearing on Friday, his lawyer, Raymond M. Schlather, said in court that Mr. Reynolds had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder with paranoid features, according to the Cornell Daily Sun, the campus newspaper. The government has charged Mr. Reynolds with four federal crimes: possessing a silencer, owning an explosive device and providing two false statements in the process of paying a friend to purchase the rifle for him. He will remain in custody while he undergoes the examination to determine if he is competent to stand trial. Each of the four charges carries a maximum of up to 10 years in prison. AR-15-style rifles have been used in several high-profile school shootings, but Mr. Reynolds’s friends said the former student feared those very attacks and may have acquired the weapons to protect himself and those he knew. Mr. Reynolds’s lawyer said his client “is ill” and that preliminary indications show “that there were no targets, that there were no plans, and that the materials and conduct at issue were defensive in nature, arising out of his medical condition.”      The student paper quoted Mr. Schlather as saying that Mr. Reynolds is driven by “a huge paranoia of the world beyond him and protecting himself from that world.”  Edwin Kye, a close friend of Mr. Reynolds’s and a Cornell student, said Mr. Reynolds harbored fears that someone would attack him, his family or his friends. “One of the things he was afraid of was a potential school shooting or another incident like that on campus,” Mr. Kye said in an interview. “I think part of the reason he accumulated what he had was to prepare himself in the event of any sort of shooting.” Mr. Kye said he wrote off Mr. Reynolds’ behavior as excessively cautious or a result of his bipolar diagnosis and “never thought it would be taken to the extreme.” Other students said the raid has made them question how safe they are in Ithaca, which many consider a bubble from the outside world, and forced them to confront the national debate over gun control and mental health. “I was shocked to hear about it,” said Grace Yuan, who lives on the same floor as Mr. Reynolds, just a few doors down. “I thought that Collegetown was very safe.” Ms. Yuan said her parents, who live in Hong Kong, were worried about the possibility of a mass shooting when she applied to colleges in the United States, a fear echoed by international students in the campus newspaper. “I’m really relieved that someone spoke up about it,” Ms. Yuan said. “It’s terrifying to imagine any alternative outcome.” A version of this article appears in print on March 20, 2018, on Page A25 of the New York edition with the headline: He Stockpiled Weapons.

Opinion,368," Supported by By Pamela Druckerman PARIS — When people used to ask me what I missed about America, I would say, “The optimism.” I grew up in the land of hope, then moved to one whose catchphrases are “It’s not possible” and “Hell is other people.” I walked around Paris feeling conspicuously chipper. But lately I’ve had a kind of emotional whiplash. France is starting to seem like an upbeat, can-do country, while Americans are less sure that everything will be O.K. Cynicism has deep roots in France. In the 18th century, Voltaire mocked optimists for their naïveté and celebrated pessimists for their lucidity. He’s still part of the national curriculum for French eighth-graders, and the râleur — the dissatisfied, grumpy whiner — remains a national archetype. Among intellectuals, if you say that everything is going badly, “everyone says, ‘Look how intelligent he is,’” explained Frédéric Lenoir, author of “Happiness: A Philosopher’s Guide.” Since I’ve lived here, polls have regularly shown that the French are more pessimistic about their country’s future than people in Afghanistan and Iraq. The French haven’t become magically cheerful, but there’s a creeping sense that hope isn’t idiotic, and life can actually improve. As is common with a new president, there was a jump in optimism after Emmanuel Macron was elected last year. But this time, optimism has remained strong, and in January it hit an eight-year high. It helps that France’s economy is finally growing more and that Mr. Macron has made good on promises ranging from overhauling the labor laws to shrinking class sizes at kindergartens in disadvantaged areas. For those still mourning France’s lost glory as a global power, he has taken the rhetorical lead on climate change and the European Union. And they feel lucky by comparison, as they watch Britain march off a plank with Brexit, and read about American children being killed at school. Voters here still have grievances, and many are reserving judgment. But in the French context, that’s practically euphoria. “The France of the optimists has won, and is dragging the other part of France toward its own side,” said Claudia Senik, an economist who heads the Well-Being Observatory, an academic think tank here. The French are even taking an intellectual interest in this alien idea. There are optimism clubs, conferences and school programs, scholars of positivity and books like “50+1 Good Reasons to Choose Optimism.” In September Mr. Macron was a patron of the Global Positive Forum, a study group of “positive initiatives” in business and government. (“Tomorrow can be better than today,” the forum’s website insists.) It’s still an awkward fit. A TV documentary last fall followed a Parisienne as she tried to adopt a positive outlook, as if she was learning a foreign language. “It seems like it’s a skill, a discipline that one learns,” she marveled. But you can now get away with dream-the-impossible-dream rhetoric, once disdained as American psychobabble. “From the moment you tell Macron that something isn’t possible, he has a tendency to consider that it is,” a presidential spokesman gushed. Meanwhile America’s national mood has drifted in the opposite direction. Before Donald Trump took office, optimism about his presidency was the lowest of any president-elect since at least the 1970s. We’re still upbeat about the economy, but just 27 percent of Americans are confident that we’re “generally headed in the right direction,” according to an Economist/YouGov poll. Optimism — even, and perhaps especially in the face of difficulty — has long been an American hallmark. “What the American public wants is a tragedy with a happy ending,” the novelist William Dean Howells supposedly said. It’s a shock to realize that we might not get our happy ending anytime soon. I feel this from across the ocean. High school friends recently took up a collection to pay the medical bills of a classmate with pancreatic cancer. On a video call the other day, my father — an ardent patriot who grew up during World War II, and was never very interested in politics — suddenly wept about America’s future. Of course, there are many varieties of American optimism. Not all are doomed. There’s the American dream, which holds that you can achieve whatever you want by working hard enough (and its new-age variant, in which you merely have to visualize it). But when the state is going after immigrants, and it’s become tougher to move to a higher earnings bracket, it’s hard to make a case for this theory. There’s the idea of American exceptionalism — that we’re uniquely blessed and fated to succeed, so our problems must inevitably be fixed. With America lagging other rich countries in realms from health care to high school test scores, it’s difficult to make a case for this, either. The one form of American optimism that’s still credible is the kind that’s coming from the high school students in Parkland, Fla. It’s a tactical, tenacious, cleareyed optimism, in the tradition of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It acknowledges that something is terribly wrong. And in the best part of the American tradition, these kids — and others like them — aren’t just whining. They’re determined to fix it. That’s what I miss most.

Sports,369," By KEN BELSONFEB. 23, 2018 Jonathan Martin, the former N.F.L. offensive lineman who was at the center of a bullying scandal in 2013, was detained by the police after posting a seemingly threatening message on social media. A photograph he posted on Instagram showed a shotgun and included a message that said bullying victims had only two choices, suicide and revenge. It included the name of the private high school he attended in Los Angeles, prompting officials there to shut the school on Friday. “When you’re a bully victim & a coward, your options are suicide, or revenge,” the post read. The incident comes less than two weeks after a former student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killed 17 teachers and students. Officials at Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles sent an alert to students around 7 a.m. Friday. Martin, who posted the image on his Instagram account on Thursday, did not explicitly threaten the school. But the photo of the shotgun and shells included the hashtag #HarvardWestlake.  “Out of abundance of caution, and because the safety of our students, faculty, and staff is our top priority, we made the decision to close school today,” the school said in a statement. “We are working closely with law enforcement and will share more information when we are able.” Martin’s photo also included the hashtag #MiamiDolphins, the team that drafted him out of Stanford in 2012. In 2013, Martin left the team after seven games because he said that another offensive lineman, Richie Incognito, had repeatedly bullied him and used racist language. Martin left the team abruptly and later said that he was under psychological duress and had considered suicide.      Incognito was suspended for bullying Martin, other teammates and a team employee. Martin played the next season for the San Francisco 49ers, but has not appeared in an N.F.L. game since then. Incognito sat out the 2014 season, but played the next three years for the Buffalo Bills. A 144-page report commissioned by the N.F.L. to explore allegations of bullying on the Dolphins found that Incognito and two fellow offensive linemen, John Jerry and Mike Pouncey, “engaged in a pattern of harassment” toward Martin; another young offensive lineman; and an assistant trainer, including improper touching and sexual taunting. In his post on Instagram on Thursday, Martin included the social media handles for Incognito and Pouncey, among others. Incognito insisted that he never bullied Martin and was in fact his friend and mentor. Many of the more than 1,000 text messages between Incognito and Martin that were released contained lewd descriptions and profane language that could be viewed as part of a friendship.  But privately, Martin was furious. According to the report, the mistreatment began early in the 2012 season, Martin’s rookie year, and the frequency of insults grew after Martin refused to fight back. Incognito, who is white, sometimes made jokes about slavery in the presence of Martin, who is black, the report said. An earlier version of this article misstated the type of weapon pictured in Jonathan Martin’s Instagram post. It showed a shotgun and shells, not a rifle and bullets.

                FEB. 20, 2018 Just hours after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., students turned to social media to advocate for more gun control. Watch the video above. What are your reactions to what these students of Stoneman Douglas High School share? In “A ‘Mass Shooting Generation’ Cries Out for Change,” Audra D. S. Burch, Patricia Mazzei and Jack Healy write: This is life for the children of the mass shooting generation. They were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, and grew up practicing active shooter drills and huddling through lockdowns. They talked about threats and safety steps with their parents and teachers. With friends, they wondered darkly whether it could happen at their own school, and who might do it. Now, this generation is almost grown up. And when a gunman killed 17 people this week at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., the first response of many of their classmates was not to grieve in silence, but to speak out. Their urgent voices — in television interviews, on social media, even from inside a locked school office as they hid from the gunman — are now rising in the national debate over gun violence in the aftermath of yet another school shooting. … At other high schools across the country, students rallied in solidarity with Stoneman Douglas High and staged walkouts to protest what they called Washington’s inaction in protecting students and teachers. A gun control advocacy group, Moms Demand Action, said it had been so overwhelmed with requests from students that it was setting up a parallel, student focused advocacy group. “People say it’s too early to talk about it,” Mr. Kasky said. “If you ask me, it’s way too late.” His argument reflects the words of other students who want action: The issue is not an abstraction to them. These are their murdered friends, their bloodstained schools, their upended lives. Students said they did not want to cede the discussion over their lives to politicians and adult activists. “We need to take it into our hands,” Mr. Kasky said. Students: Read the entire article, then watch the speech from the Stoneman Douglas High School senior Emma González at the Not One More rally for gun legislation held at the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Saturday: — What role do you think the students of Stoneman Douglas High School and other schools may play in ending gun violence in schools? Why do you think they are having such an impact? Do you think they can do more than adults can right now? Why or why not? — What do you think about Cameron Kasky’s statement that students need to take the discussion “into their own hands”? — As “children of the mass shooting generation,” how might young people’s perspectives be different from older people’s?  — What do you think about the feelings and opinions that Ms. González expresses? What words from her speech do you find especially notable for any reason?  — To what degree do you find her arguments persuasive? Explain. — How would you respond if you were asked by political leaders and other adults what should be done to end gun violence? — How do you think people of different generations can learn from each other when it comes to issues like safety in schools? — What other issues do you feel young people and those in older generations may have different perspectives on? Why? — Do you think your generation has the power to shape our world here and now? Explain. Teachers: We also have a related lesson plan that features more on the voices of students: Resources for Talking and Teaching About the School Shooting in Florida Students 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public.  See More » ",2018-02-20,0.0017982873,Tuesday
Opinion,371," Supported by On Campus By Scott Korb Mr. Korb teaches writing to first-year college students. Last August, as college started up again, I hadn’t quite finished my beach read, William Finnegan’s “Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life,” so I brought it to my freshman writing class. I tried reading a few passages aloud to break the ice. I thought my students might relate to one in which the writer first wonders about turning his surfing experiences into something worth reading: “Our queer devotions, frustrations, little triumphs, and large peculiarities, plus a few waterfront characters, plus photos, could probably keep a blog burbling along.” “What do you make of that?” I asked. “Large peculiarities — what do you suppose he means?” Crickets. Sand I’d smuggled back from California slid from between the pages to my desk. Maybe they were wondering what a blog was. We expect college freshmen to feel at least as comfortable with self-expression as the burbling bloggers and writers of yesteryear. Something beyond stylized selfies must populate their social media streams, after all. But every year I find that getting them to admit to feeling devoted or frustrated, to being peculiar in any way (much less in a large way), verges on impossible. And as someone who has read thousands of student essays over the past 10 years, few things are more dispiriting — and as the pages mount, soul-crushing — than those written by 18-year-olds who can’t see themselves as peculiar. But why can’t they? One reason reveals itself when someone finally asks the clarifying question: “Do you mean we can write with the word ‘I’?” The class looks up in wonder. This happens every semester. Somewhere along the way, these young people were told by teachers that who they are in their writing ought to be divorced from who they are on their phones, or as the writer Grace Paley may have said, with their families and on their streets. They know a private “I” who experiences devotion and frustration. I see them text in class and talk and laugh and sometimes cry in the halls. They wear band T-shirts, often from my era, so I assume they have taste. I watch them read. But no matter who they are in private, when I first encounter their writing, they use only the public passive voice: The text was read. The test was taken. It’s never: I read the text. I took the test. And it is never ever: I loved the text with queer devotion! It’s true that a student’s writing style isn’t everything and that much of what we call good writing cannot be taught. (Bad writing apparently has been.) One can be devoted to something — a band from the ’90s, surfing, YHWH— without being able to put that devotion into words. But my experience with students has me worried that years of “texts being read” and “tests being taken” have created the sense in them that whatever they’re devoted to doesn’t matter much to the rest of us — so long as they know the answers to our questions, so long as they pass the test. Writing so passively and with what they’ve been taught is appropriate and “objective” distance from topics they often seem disinterested in, these young people signal to me that they’re still waiting for something important or real to happen to them. Perhaps they feel that only someone who has lived through something momentous — like the teenagers who survived the Parkland, Fla., shooting — has earned the right to be heard. It’s hard to imagine any of those young activists writing, “The rally was held because Congress was lobbied and guns were purchased.” But what about those queer devotions and frustrations, experiences and ideas that have stirred an individual heart into peculiarity? A decade teaching young writers has taught me a great deal. First, we need to value more the complete and complex lives of young people: where they come from, how they express themselves. They have already lived lives worthy of our attention and appreciation. Second, we need to encourage young people to take seriously those lives they’ve lived, even as they come to understand — often through schooling and just as often not — that there’s a whole lot more we’ll expect of them. Through this, we can help them learn to expect more of themselves, too. Some lines from the great writer John McPhee have helped me consolidate these lessons over the years. Reflecting in The New Yorker in 2011, he wrote: “I once made a list of all the pieces I had written in maybe 20 or 30 years, and then put a check mark beside each one whose subject related to things I had been interested in before I went to college. I checked off more than 90 percent.” I always tell my students that I find these lines heartening. As a writer, I’ve spent more than 20 years reckoning with the joys and tragedies, the shame and grief, commitments to sports and study, of my own pre-college years. A good deal of my writing continues to take me to northern Florida where, when I was young, my father was killed by a drunken driver; the stories I continue to uncover there — about justice and race and addiction — begin with me at 5 and continue through my adolescence into this adult life. Mr. McPhee, and Mr. Finnegan, too — who at 13, he writes, found in the obliterative sea that “the frontiers of the thinkable were quietly, fitfully edging back” — tell me that there’s no good reason for me ever to stop going to Florida and attending to what happened there. At the start of this semester, I read some passages from Barry Lopez’s wintry classic “Arctic Dreams.” The descriptions are incomparable, even as the setting itself remains ineffable: “The physical landscape is baffling in its ability to transcend whatever we would make of it. It is as subtle in its expression as turns of the mind, and larger than our grasp; and yet it is still knowable.” This has been the lesson for my students this term. Look around at what baffles you; look in at your peculiar self and how your own frontiers continue to edge back. Don’t worry, you’ll never fully grasp how the world transcends you and your ability to describe it. I surely don’t, and I’m 41! But don’t forget: You’ve been trying to understand and triumph in the world for as long as you can remember, even as a kid. Now go and write.

None,372," By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 17, 2018, 6:22 P.M. E.D.T. ___ IMF: A major trade rift could imperil solid global economy WASHINGTON (AP) — The International Monetary Fund warned that rising trade tensions between the United States and China risk undermining a global economy that the IMF believes should otherwise grow solidly this year. The lending agency has kept its forecast for worldwide growth this year at 3.9 percent, which would be its fastest pace since 2011. But its chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, said this bright outlook could be derailed by a major trade conflict. ___ Starbucks to close stores for an afternoon for bias training NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks says it will close its more than 8,000 U.S. stores for several hours next month to conduct racial-bias training to its nearly 175,000 workers. The company is trying to tamp down a racially charged uproar over the arrest of two black men at one of its stores in Philadelphia. The arrests had sparked protests and calls for a boycott on social media. ___ Supreme Court hears case about online sales tax collection WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court seems concerned about doing away with a rule that has meant consumers don't get charged sales tax on some online purchases. The justices heard argument Tuesday in a case that deals with businesses' collection of sales tax on online purchases. Right now, if a business is shipping a product to a state where it doesn't have an office, warehouse or other physical presence, it doesn't have to collect the state's sales tax. States want the Supreme Court to abandon that rule. ___ IRS payment site fails on tax day, extensions to be granted Americans who waited until the last day to pay their tax bill got an unwelcome surprise: The IRS website to make payments and access other key services is down. The IRS still expects Americans to pay their taxes but U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin says extensions will be granted to those impacted when the site is up again  ___ Cambridge Analytica ex-CEO refuses to testify in UK LONDON (AP) — The British Parliament's media committee says that Cambridge Analytica's former CEO, Alexander Nix, will no longer testify at an upcoming session on fake news, citing an investigation by British authorities. Nix had been recalled by the committee to testify Wednesday following testimony by Christopher Wylie on the use of data belonging to some 87 million Facebook users in the campaign for Donald Trump's presidential election.  ___ 1 dead after jetliner apparently blows an engine in flight PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A Southwest Airlines jet apparently blew an engine at about 30,000 feet and got hit by shrapnel that smashed a window and damaged the fuselage Tuesday, killing a passenger and injuring seven others, authorities said. The plane, a twin-engine Boeing 737 bound from New York to Dallas with 149 people aboard, made an emergency landing in Philadelphia just before noon as passengers breathing through oxygen masks that dropped from the ceiling said their prayers and braced for impact. ___ Goldman reports 26 percent surge in profits, helped by taxes NEW YORK (AP) — Investment bank Goldman Sachs said Tuesday that its first quarter profits rose by 26 percent, helped by a lower tax bill and a surge in market volatility. The Wall Street bank earned $2.83 billion, or $6.95 a share, compared with $2.26 billion, or $5.15 a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts' forecasts, who were looking for Goldman to earn $5.58 a share, according to FactSet.      ___ Dick's destroying all the guns it pulled from its shelves PITTSBURGH (AP) — Dick's Sporting Goods is destroying all the guns and accessories that it stopped selling earlier this year after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida. The retailer said Tuesday that it is in the process of destroying all the firearms it pulled from its shelves, rather than trying to return them to their manufacturers. ___ Russia blocks some Google, Amazon servers after Telegram ban MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's communications watchdog says it is blocking access to some servers owned by tech giants Google and Amazon in order to comply with a court order to block a popular messaging app. The Russian Communications Agency told the Interfax news agency Tuesday it was blocking a ""significant number"" of servers owned by Google and Amazon because it believes that the Telegram app is using them to circumvent the ban. ___ Iceland company to resume commercial hunting of fin whales REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) — A whaling company in Iceland says it is preparing to bring commercial hunting of fin whales back to the Nordic island nation after a two-year freeze. Hvalur hf (Whale Inc.) says it is readying two vessels for the 100-day summer whaling season. Fin whale hunting stopped in Iceland after the 2015 hunt, when Japan refused to import the catch because of health requirements. Fin whales are the world's second-largest whales, and Iceland is the only country where they can be hunted commercially. ___ US stocks add to gains as company earnings reports impress NEW YORK (AP) — Technology companies led U.S. stocks solidly higher, giving the market its second straight gain. Consumer-services companies, retailers and health care stocks accounted for a big slice of the broad rally. Banks declined, pulled down by falling bond yields. Oil prices recovered from an early slide. Upbeat company earnings and outlooks, as well as some encouraging economic data, helped put investors in a buying mood. ___ The S&P 500 index rose 28.55 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,706.39. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 213.59 points, or 0.9 percent, to 24,786.63. The Nasdaq composite climbed 124.81 points, or 1.7 percent, to 7,281.10. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 16.77 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,579.80. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 30 cents to settle at $66.52 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 16 cents to close at $71.58 per barrel.

                MARCH 15, 2018 Elon, N.C. Lapeer, Mich. Allendale, N.J. Parkland, Fla. Noblesville, Ind. Newtown, Conn. Did you take part in the national school walkouts to protest gun violence on March 14? If so, why did you decide to join, and what was the experience like? If not, why did you decide to opt out? Have you ever taken part in any other kind of political activism? Do you think that in general it is good for teenagers to participate this way? Why or why not? In “National School Walkout: Thousands Protest Against Gun Violence Across the U.S.,” Alan Blinder and Julie Turkewitz write: Thousands of students, emboldened by a growing protest movement over gun violence, stood up in their classrooms on Wednesday and walked out of their schools in a nationwide demonstration, one month after a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Florida. The 17-minute protests unfolding at hundreds of schools are intended to pressure Congress to approve gun control legislation after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and come 10 days before major protests in Washington and elsewhere. … The demonstrations unfolded in different ways from city to city and school to school. In some places, demonstrators chanted and held signs. At other schools, students stood in silence. In Atlanta, some students took a knee. Thousands of students around New York, many backed by permission slips from their parents, walked out of their schools and converged on central locations — Columbus Circle, Battery Park, Brooklyn Borough Hall, Lincoln Center. … In Washington, thousands left their classrooms in the city and its suburbs and marched to the Capitol steps, their high-pitched voices battling against the stiff wind: “Hey-hey, ho-ho, the N.R.A. has got to go!” One sign said: “Fix This, Before I Text My Mom from Under A Desk.” Another article published on the same day, this one from the Well section, explains “Why Demonstrating Is Good for Kids.” In it, Lisa Damour writes: Participating in political activism may be good for our teenagers, according to a new research report. The study, published in January in the journal Child Development, found that late adolescents and young adults who voted, volunteered or engaged in activism ultimately went further in school and had higher incomes than those who did not mobilize for political or social change. By tracking nearly 10,000 young people from a wide variety of ethnic, racial and economic backgrounds, researchers from Wake Forest School of Medicine, Fordham University and the University of Massachusetts measured the long-term implications of youth political and social engagement. Remarkably, they found that civic activity linked to better academic and financial outcomes regardless of early school performance and parental education levels, two factors that usually drive later success. Of course, correlation does not prove causation, but the study makes a case for the benefits of civic engagement. In light of the findings, Parissa Ballard, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor in the department of family and community medicine at Wake Forest School of Medicine, said that “having meaningful opportunities to volunteer or be involved in activism may change how young people think about themselves or their possibilities for the future.” Students: Read both articles, then tell us … — What is your reaction to the national school walkouts to protest gun violence? What comes to mind as you read about and see photos and videos from students protesting around the country? — What is your opinion of the message that students were trying to send with these walkouts? Do you think this protest will be effective in addressing the issue of gun violence in the United States?  — How do you think teachers and administrators should respond to student protests, whether over this issue or any other? Do you think times like this, when large numbers of young people are reacting to an issue in the news, should be treated in school as “teachable moments”? If so, how?  — In general, how do you feel about teenagers participating in political activism? Do you agree with the article above that says it may be good for you? Why or why not? — What have your own experiences with political activism, however you define it, been like? If you are not politically active, how do you feel about articles like these that exhort you to vote, volunteer or take other kinds of actions? Why?

It is dedicated to the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and their efforts to turn the horrifying events of February 14 into a call to action regarding school safety and gun laws in the United States. For ideas about how to use Teenagers in The Times with your students, please see our lesson plan and special activity sheet, both of which can be used with this or any other edition. _________ Tragedy and Activism at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School With Grief and Hope, Florida Students Take Gun Control Fight On the Road  Students fed up with gun violence hopped a bus to Tallahassee, Fla., and planned protests from coast to coast.

                MARCH 15, 2018 Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The proposal was a 49-unit homeless housing complex on a vacant corner in the Boyle Heights section of Los Angeles. But it ran into a wall of neighborhood opposition — and was blocked by Jose Huizar, the city councilman who represents the area. For over a year, the Boyle Heights project loomed as a dispiriting reminder of the challenges of building housing for the homeless — no matter that California is in the midst of a housing crisis and Los Angeles voters last year agreed to spend $1.2 billion on homeless housing construction. But this week, Mr. Huizar dropped his opposition. For anyone concerned with the crisis, this seems a moment worth examining. Mr. Huizar said he changed his mind after the nonprofit agency building the project agreed to include a child-care center, increase security and conduct an environmental impact study, since the land has a dormant oil well on it. Mr. Huizar said his initial mistrust of the agency, A Community of Friends, was resolved after the two sides met and the agency agreed to those alterations.  “Look, I approve these projects in my district all the time,” he said. “It’s not a matter of Nimbyism. You have to have the trust of the community and that did not exist.”  The reversal comes as there has been mounting public concern — and embarrassment — over homelessness here, and frustration with city and neighborhood leaders who have been blocking such projects. Neighborhoods once objected to shelters on the grounds that they would draw homeless people to their streets. But in what advocates for the homeless say is a significant shift in public attitudes, the spread of homeless encampments means that for many neighborhoods, the choice might be homeless people camped out on the corner or living in an actual building up the street. The news and stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state). Sign up to get it by email.     Another factor may have been a series of Los Angeles Times editorials criticizing public officials for blocking shelters — including Mr. Huizar. The councilman, the paper reported, called “just before this series was put to bed to say he’d changed his mind and would urge the City Council to approve the Boyle Heights project.” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) Students demanding gun control walked out of classes across the nation, most notably places devastated by massacres: Parkland, Fla.; Columbine High School in Colorado; and Newtown, Conn. [The New York Times] • Thousands of students joined the walkout across California, including in Los Angeles [Los Angeles Times] and the Bay Area [KQED]. At Mount Diablo High School in Concord, staff members locked the main gates around campus before the 10 a.m. walkout. Students broke through the gates, shouting “enough is enough” before being ordered back to school.

This week, Mr. Reem, who was in jail awaiting trial, was ordered freed by a federal judge. The judge said there was no legitimate reason to hold him indefinitely by setting bail he couldn’t afford.

[The New York Times] The procession of storms sweeping in from the Pacific has made this a very wet week in Northern California. It’s still too early for a definitive answer on whether this will be the miracle March that compensates for the parched weather we had in January and February. But signs increasingly look good. Mike Kochasic, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Sacramento, says by this weekend the snowpack in the northern and central Sierra will be somewhere between half and two-thirds of normal. That’s up from just 7 percent of normal at the end of February. And there appear to be more storms on the way. “All the indications show that we are going to have an above-average rest of the month,” Mr. Kochasic said. “That should help our snowpack for sure.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

National,376," By CHRISTINA CARONMARCH 14, 2018 As thousands of students walked out of their schools on Wednesday to pressure Congress to approve gun control legislation, three other students were healing from wounds inflicted when a teacher’s firearm accidentally discharged in a California classroom. The teacher, Dennis Alexander, who is also a city councilman in Seaside, Calif., was showing the students a gun on Tuesday during his advanced public safety class at Seaside High School when the gun accidentally went off, Marci McFadden, a spokeswoman for the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District, said in a phone interview on Wednesday. Mr. Alexander was pointing his gun at the ceiling when it fired, she said, causing pieces of the ceiling to fall to the floor. Ms. McFadden said that California law and district policy prohibit teachers from bringing guns on campus. Cmdr. Nick Borges of the Seaside Police Department said in an email on Wednesday that nobody suffered serious injuries, however, a piece of bullet shrapnel ricocheted and hit one 17-year-old on the neck, and two other students were also hit by debris.  The 17-year-old boy’s parents told the television station KSBW that they took him to a hospital for X-rays after he returned home.  “He’s shaken up, but he’s going to be O.K.,” the boy’s father, Fermin Gonzales, told KSBW. “I’m just pretty upset that no one told us anything and we had to call the police ourselves to report it.” When asked why the parents had not been informed about the accident, Ms. McFadden said she could not comment because the matter was under investigation. Mr. Alexander’s class, which includes 32 juniors and seniors, has been offered for a couple of years as one of the school’s career technical education offerings, Ms. McFadden said. She said she did not know whether students are normally shown guns during the class. Mr. Alexander was placed on administrative leave at both Seaside High School and the Sand City Police Department, where he works about four hours a week as a reserve police officer whenever the department is short-handed, Sand City Police Chief Brian Ferrante said in a phone interview on Wednesday.      Mr. Alexander, who has been employed by the school district since 1994, did not immediately respond to messages on Wednesday. Across the country, another school was also investigating a weapon that discharged accidentally this week. The Alexandria Police Department in Virginia said that a school resource officer accidentally fired his gun inside his office at George Washington Middle School on Tuesday morning. Nobody was hurt, the police said. The officer, whose name was not released, is a five-year veteran of the Police Department and has been placed on administrative leave during its investigation of the episode, the police said. Both accidents occurred just days after President Trump vowed to push ahead on his proposal to arm school employees with guns, a controversial idea that would entail partnering with local law enforcement to provide teachers and other school officials with firearms training after a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 14.  “Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!” Mr. Trump said in a tweet on Monday. The latest mass shooting prompted thousands of students at hundreds of schools to walk out of class on Wednesday to protest gun violence, the culmination of weeks of public outrage at the glacial pace of gun reform, a topic that has remained prominent in the news largely through the efforts of a group of social media-savvy students from Stoneman Douglas. In Washington, where the gun debate has remained static, Mr. Trump has not indicated a willingness to disrupt the way things stand. On Monday, he discarded a proposal to raise the age limit to purchase rifles. “Not much political support (to put it mildly),” Mr. Trump said in a tweet. Instead, Mr. Trump has advocated improving reporting to the national background check system — a step that is backed by the National Rifle Association.

NYTNow,377," By KAREN ZRAICK and SANDRA STEVENSONAPRIL 13, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump has ordered strikes against Syria as punishment for a suspected chemical attack near Damascus. Britain and France joined in the strikes, he said. Check back for updates on this developing story. Earlier Friday, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley accused the Syrian government of having used chemical weapons at least 50 times during the civil war. That was higher than previous U.S. estimates. We mapped 34 of those confirmed chemical attacks. ____ 2. An “untruthful slime ball.” That’s just one of the names President Trump called the former F.B.I. director James Comey, above, on Twitter after salacious details from Mr. Comey’s forthcoming memoir leaked out. In the book, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership,” Mr. Comey denounces the president as “unethical, and untethered to truth” and said Mr. Trump reminded him of a mob boss. It goes on sale Tuesday. Here’s our review.  Separately, the Justice Department inspector general delivered a scathing report that accused Andrew McCabe, the former F.B.I. deputy director, of misleading investigators about his interactions with the media.  ____ 3. Advisers to President Trump have concluded that a wide-ranging corruption investigation in New York poses a greater — and more imminent — threat  to the president than even the special counsel’s investigation. That’s what several people close to Mr. Trump told us. Lawyers for Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, above, asked a federal judge to shield from investigators documents seized in Monday’s F.B.I. raid on Mr. Cohen’s office and hotel room. And Elliott Broidy, a major donor with close ties to the White House, resigned as deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee over revelations that he had agreed to pay $1.6 million to a former mistress. Mr. Cohen arranged the deal. ____ 4. For the third Friday in a row, thousands of Palestinians flocked to the fence separating Gaza from Israel, and were met with tear gas and live gunfire. More than 500 protesters were injured, including dozens hit by gunshots, and more than 100 were hospitalized, the Gaza Health Ministry said. One man died of earlier injuries, bringing the overall death toll of the protests to 34. We annotated an aerial photo of the fence taken by Yasser Murtaja, a Palestinian journalist who was killed there last week. ____ 5. Officials in Japan, Australia and New Zealand are reacting coolly to President Trump’s remarks that he would be interested in rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership after publicly rejecting it a year ago. Above, members of the pact met in Chile last month.  An early test of the potential for the U.S. to rejoin could come next week, when Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister and an ardent champion of the pact, is to meet with Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago. ____ 6. Nearly three dozen people across 11 states have been infected in an E. coli outbreak linked to chopped romaine lettuce from the Yuma, Ariz., region, health officials said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that it had not yet identified the source — and it urged consumers to avoid any chopped romaine lettuce from the Yuma area. “If you cannot confirm the source of the lettuce, do not buy or eat it,” the C.D.C. said in a statement. The agency also recommended that restaurants and retailers not serve chopped romaine lettuce from the region. Of those infected, 22 were hospitalized, and three developed a type of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported. ____ 7. A teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., was arrested after he forgot his loaded gun in a restroom at a nearby beach, the authorities said. By the time Sean Simpson, above, realized the gun was missing and returned to the restroom, a drunken man had picked it up and fired a bullet into a wall. Mr. Simpson grabbed the gun from the man and was arrested by responding police officers. He was charged with failing to safely store a weapon, which can carry a maximum 60-day sentence.  ____ 8. The credit card chip killed the signature. Signatures on credit card receipts are about to become extinct in the U.S. Later this month, four of the largest networks — American Express, Discover, Mastercard and Visa — will stop requiring them to complete transactions. Once upon a time, retailers could be held liable if they failed to notice that the signature on a receipt did not match the one on the back of the customer’s card. But signatures have become a relic as more updated security measures took hold in the marketplace. ____ 9. What are you cooking this weekend? Our food editor, Sam Sifton, is considering firing up his grill — ribs, perhaps? And he’s definitely making mac and cheese, which is the subject of our latest digital cookbook. “We wanted a baseline understanding of the dish as a baked side dish for barbecues and cookouts, and as a midweek stovetop meal, the sort some ordinarily make out of a box,” he explained. We asked the cookbook author (and frequent NYT Cooking contributor) Alison Roman to help create the guide. “And, jeepers, did she deliver,” Mr. Sifton wrote. ____ 10. Finally, it’s not all bad out there. Here’s the week in good news. Our subjects include sports enthusiasts who don’t let injuries or old age keep them from games, like Phil Coyne, above; the long-delayed arrival of springtime in New York; and everything you didn’t think you wanted to know about the coming royal wedding.

NYTNow,378," By KAREN ZRAICK and DAVID SCULLMARCH 14, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Thousands of American high school students walked out of class as part of a nationwide demonstration against gun violence. The protests, held across the country, came one month after the Parkland, Fla., school massacre and aimed to pressure Congress to pass gun control laws. “We have grown up watching more tragedies occur and continuously asking: Why?” said a student at Columbine High School, above, where a 1999 attack seemed to signal the start of the era of school shootings. ____ 2.  Conor Lamb, the Democrat in a special House election in southwestern Pennsylvania, scored an extraordinary razor-thin upset in what had been a Trump stronghold.  Mr. Lamb, a 33-year-old Marine Corps veteran from a local political dynasty, echoed traditional Democratic themes about union rights and economic issues in his campaign.  But he also rejected the leadership of Representative Nancy Pelosi, welcomed support from people who voted for President Trump and took a more conservative position on the hot-button issue of guns. ____ 3. President Trump is remaking his cabinet, moving it closer to the nationalist ideas that animated his campaign. Our reporter was with Rex Tillerson, above, as he toured Africa in his last days as secretary of state. On “The Daily,” we discuss what his exit means for negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear program. The latest updates: Mr. Trump named the CNBC commentator Larry Kudlow as his top economic adviser. And the administration may fire the former F.B.I. deputy director, Andrew McCabe, just days before he’s scheduled to retire. That would jeopardize his pension. ____ 4. Prime Minister Theresa May, above, suspended high-level contacts with Russia and expelled 23 Russian diplomats over the poisoning of a former Russian double agent on British soil. She vowed to crack down on Russian spies, corrupt elites and ill-gotten wealth in Britain. Our correspondent explains why Moscow will never apologize for the attack on its former spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter. ____ 5. “Not since Albert Einstein has a scientist so captured the public imagination and endeared himself to tens of millions of people around the world.”  Tributes have been pouring in for Stephen Hawking, the physicist and author whose mind soared past physical paralysis and changed our understanding of the universe. He died at 76. Our science reporter for physics and cosmology wrote his obituary. Above, a beach in India. Here’s a brief history of Dr. Hawking’s work. Movies were made about him, he made cameos on TV shows, and he inspired composers and songwriters. Here are six cultural moments he inspired and some of his most memorable quotations. ____ 6. “This is going to be a catastrophe.” Rohingya refugees who fled from Myanmar face looming disaster when the impending storms of the monsoon season hit their vast camp in Bangladesh. A top U.N. official said this week that the Myanmar military’s campaign against the Rohingya bore “the hallmarks of genocide.” Senior government officials denied the accusation. ____ 7. An immersive, multimedia theater production called “Universal Judgment: Michelangelo and the Secrets of the Sistine Chapel,” makes its debut in Rome on Thursday. Above, the character of Michelangelo floats as he paints. Its artistic director, Marco Balich, best known as a designer of over-the-top spectacles like Olympic ceremonies, worked with the Vatican on the show. Sting did the soundtrack. “Italy has all these very conservative art critics, and they are against the idea of ‘spettacolarizzazione,’” Mr. Balich said, using an Italian expression for putting on a big show. “They hate that word; I love that word.” ____ 8. Are technicolor croissants blasphemy or natural evolution? That’s the question our food writer asks in T Magazine. She takes stock of the long history of the croissant; the development of its fetish-object cousin, the Cronut; and the broader significance of such “Frankenpastries.”  “The croissant is dead; long live the croissant,” she concludes. ____ 9. Après pastry, a little cardio. You may have heard that exercise is good for you. Two new studies of older recreational cyclists show just how good. They weren’t just healthier than their sedentary counterparts. They were also, biologically, younger. ____ 10. Finally, here’s our popular roundup of the late-night comedy shows. And our TV folks also publish highlights of what’s on live TV and streaming services each weeknight. For Wednesday, that includes Smithsonian’s “The Mountain Lion and Me,” which follows a mama lion and three kittens as they face predators and a bitter winter in Yellowstone National Park. (Some of the footage comes from cameras installed in their cave.) Have a great night. ____ Get a nightly rundown of the day’s top stories, delivered to your inbox every Monday through Friday.

                Grace Notes             By                     
                                    JAMES BARRON
                            
                APRIL 15, 2018 Sarah Charlop-Powers was comparing New York City’s forests to its subways. The city has more than 840 miles of tracks for one. It has 10,542 acres of the other, about half as much as the Congaree Swamp in South Carolina, a small national park with an old-growth forest and, according to the website I Love National Parks, “more bugs than you can imagine.” No doubt there are many bugs in New York’s forests, even cockroaches that have yet to find their way to somebody’s basement or bathtub. But Ms. Charlop-Powers, the executive director of a Manhattan-based nonprofit group called the Natural Areas Conservancy, is not focused on them. She sees the trees — and the forest. Most of the city’s forest is deep in parks, and on the worry spectrum, she is “concerned” about them. “The situation is not dissimilar to the subways, in that we’re at a crucial moment,” she said. Fortunately, urban forests appear to be at the point the subways reached decades ago, before transit policymakers decided that maintenance could be deferred. But there is another concern for urban forests: climate change. Ms. Charlop-Powers wants to prepare the city’s forests for a changing climate. If nothing else, forests can slow rising temperatures by reducing what foresters call urban “heat-island effects.” Trees lower the nearby temperature by up to nine degrees. There is also the worry that forests could be overrun by invasive species that can change soil conditions — another contributing factor on the climate change checklist.  So, among other things, Ms. Charlop-Powers wants plants that can resist climate change to be planted where they could make a difference.  She and Bram Gunther, a former chief of forestry, horticulture and natural resources for the Parks Department, founded the conservancy in 2012, when the city’s Million Trees NYC initiative was underway. That program began when Michael R. Bloomberg was mayor and was completed two years ago with a planting in the South Bronx. Scores of curbside tree pits got new occupants, but half of the million trees went into what the city describes as “forested natural areas.” But, Ms. Charlop-Powers said, there was no long-term plan for managing the city’s forests or the less densely wooded areas in parks. The Million Trees project “didn’t focus beyond getting trees in the ground,” she said. Enter the Natural Areas Conservancy, which began by conducting a survey. The group hired 25 scientists to take stock of biological conditions in parks. The conservancy’s senior ecologist, Helen Forgione, said the survey found 750 species of plants in the city’s forests. The survey-takers also interviewed 1,600 park users. Their answers led to the conclusion that the urban forest has never been more important for people. “Half the people reported recreating in New York City parkland, never leaving to go to the Catskills or Jones Beach,” Ms. Charlop-Powers said. “Their whole experience with nature is happening right here in the five boroughs, which means that if we want people not just to experience playgrounds and ball fields but to take a hike or be in a place where you can hear birds singing, it becomes really important to invest in forests.” So, as with the subways, it’s about money. The legislature in Albany approved $836 million for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s subway action plan after he declared a mass-transit state of emergency last year. For the forests, Ms. Charlop-Powers sees a smaller price tag and a longer timeline: $385 million over 25 years. “Without investment, we risk losing wildlife and plants we may never be able to get back,” Ms. Charlop-Powers said.      The biological data indicated the city’s forests “are at a tipping point,” she said. The mature forests, which for the most part grew after the Civil War on land that earlier generations had logged and farmed, are “surprisingly healthy, similar to the conditions in rural forests upstate.”  The assumption had been that invasive vine species like Japanese honeysuckle and the mile-a-minute weed (Persicaria perfoliata to those in the know) were crowding out the trees foresters prefer. Invasive species were indeed found in 56 percent of the areas in the survey, but they were less prevalent in the older forests. It was the younger forests that troubled Ms. Charlop-Powers, especially in what foresters call the midstory and understory layers, the lower levels of the tree canopy. The researchers taking the survey found the smallest proportion of native species among the 561 species they counted in the understory. The invaders include the Norway maple and the black locust. The latter, Ms. Forgione, the ecologist, said is rot-resistant, which is good, but raises nitrogen levels in the soil, which is not. “We don’t want high-nutrient soil,” she said. “Our mature forests have evolved on low-nutrient soil.” And the higher nitrogen levels figure in climate change. Now, in close consultation with the Parks Department, the conservancy has prepared a long-term plan for the care of the city’s forests, what it says is the first of its kind in the nation. The conservancy is eager to export it and is training other nonprofit groups in the city to use data from the survey to their advantage. The recommendations in the plan are for what Ms. Forgione calls “future forests,” but specifically future urban forests. She said that climate change could affect urban forests a generation or two before differences begin to appear in rural areas. Already the conservancy’s ideas are shaping a chunk of forest in Prospect Park in Brooklyn. On a recent day, Susan M. Donoghue, the administrator and president of the Prospect Park Alliance, which manages the park, led the way to the area, on Lookout Hill. Longfellow’s “forest primeval” it was not. A helicopter whipped the air overhead, and a jet climbing away from Kennedy International Airport whined in the distance. Last summer the alliance brought in four goats to do some weeding. Their mission was to clear out invasive species — but only on one side of the path. In the grayish light of early spring, it was the greener-looking side because it had English ivy, a nonnative species. Unlike, say, poison ivy, English ivy can take over the forest floor and crowd out trees. On the other side of the path, Ms. Forgione pointed to a sugar maple and an ash, trees that are considered desirable in the forest, although the ash is a species threatened by the Emerald ash borer, a beetle. “It’s a tree we would not recommend planting,” Ms. Forgione said. “In New York City, the days are numbered for our ash trees.” But there are 10 trees on the conservancy’s list that will soon be planted on Lookout Hill, including three types of hickories with irresistible names — the pignut hickory, the shagbark hickory and the mockernut hickory.  “We’re thinking for the next century,” Ms. Forgione said. “That’s going to be our forest.” A version of this article appears in print on April 16, 2018, on Page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: A Turning Point, and a Plan, For Forests in the Urban Jungle.

Culture,380," By SOPAN DEBAPRIL 15, 2018 It turns out that the comedian John Mulaney wasn’t the only “Saturday Night Live” alum returning this week. Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro made surprise cameos in Saturday’s uproarious opening sketch, during which Stiller played the embattled personal lawyer to President Trump, Michael D. Cohen, and De Niro appeared as Robert Mueller, the special counsel in the Russia investigation. Stiller was briefly a cast member in 1989. It was an imaginative cold open — with strong use of A-list talent. The sketch began with Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, played by Beck Bennett and Kate McKinnon, remarking on the exceptionally bad week they and their allies in Washington had experienced. [ Need help figuring out what to watch on Netflix? Here are the best movies on the streaming service as well as some recent TV series worth watching. ]  “The important thing is to stay calm,” Bennett said. “In a couple of months, the president will be back to normal.”  “How’s that?” McKinnon asked. “Because it will be me,” Bennett replied. Soon after, Stiller walked on stage, introducing himself as Cohen, “attorney at law, and also sometimes not at law.” He went on to express disgust at having recently had his office and hotel raided by the F.B.I. in connection with multiple inquiries, including the Stormy Daniels affair, saying that the raids were “a complete violation of attorney-criminal privilege.” Stiller acknowledged that the recent headlines had been problematic. (“I’m Donald Trump’s lawyer! I’ve got a whole hard drive that’s just labeled ‘Yikes!’”) But he remained loyal to the president, whom he called “the smartest, kindest, sexiest, least colluding man on this planet.” Finally, Stiller was sent to an interrogation room to meet with De Niro, who immediately strapped him to a lie-detector machine. It took a couple of seconds for this part of the sketch to settle in with the audience. But eventually it hit: It was a recreation of a scene from the 2000 comedy “Meet the Parents,” in which Stiller and De Niro both starred, except that this time, De Niro was playing Mueller instead of an overprotective father. The sketch even included lines lifted straight from the movie. There was Stiller saying, “You can milk anything with nipples.” And De Niro responding: “Really? I have nipples. Can you milk me, Mr. Cohen?” Mulaney made his highly anticipated hosting debut for “S.N.L.,” a show for which he was a writer for five seasons, creating among other things many “Weekend Update” sketches that have since become canon. His opening monologue was a proper stand-up set that showcased his talent for dry, sardonic humor. He talked about aging: “I don’t like any new songs. Because every new song is about how tonight is the night.” He added: “I want to write songs for people in their 30s called ‘Tonight’s No Good. How About Wednesday?’” On a related note, he expressed feeling left behind by modern technology. “The world is run by robots,” he said. “And sometimes they ask us if we’re a robot. Just because we’re trying to log on and look at our own stuff.”  He added: “You spend a lot of your day telling a robot you’re not a robot. Think about that for two minutes and tell me you don’t want to walk into the ocean.” The hosts of “Weekend Update,” Michael Che and Colin Jost, went to town on Cohen’s headline-grabbing week. Here’s a sampling of the greatest hits: “Authorities first became suspicious of Cohen when they found out he was the lawyer for Donald Trump.” — Michael Che “This does not look good for Trump. If being black has taught me anything, it’s that when the feds come kicking in your door, they’ve got something.” — M.C. “It’s amazing how we keep hearing ‘historic’ in reference to things that are happening during Trump’s administration, and none of them are positive. Historic has become a polite way of saying, ‘unbelievably terrible.’” — Colin Jost “These Trump stories are so random and insane, I feel like a contestant on ‘Chopped.’ ‘What the hell am I supposed to do with all these ingredients?’” — M.C. “President Trump responded to the claims in Comey’s memoir calling him a leaker and a liar, which coincidentally is also the name of the video the Russians have.” — C.J. Your mission, should you choose to accept it: Find a character McKinnon can’t play. This week, she portrayed the Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who has found herself in hot water recently after having taunted  David Hogg, 17, one of the survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. McKinnon revealed some of her new sponsors, which included Carl’s Sr. and Malaysian Airlines: “Caught in a scandal and need an escape? Malaysian Airlines.” Over all, she was defiant: “I will continue to defend the First Amendment. That’s my right to bully people without being bullied in return.” Why would anyone ever order lobster at a New York City diner? Or any seafood, for that matter? And with that one simple premise, the “S.N.L.” writers produced one of the best sketches of the season. A diner patron played by Pete Davidson really wanted some seafood after winning a lawsuit against Bumble, a dating app, for giving him zero matches. After some initial pushback, the server relented, and out came a defiant Kenan Thompson, dressed as a 40-year-old lobster in a tank, singing a spirited parody of “One Day More,” a song from the Broadway musical “Les Misérables.” (“Who am I? And why am I condemned to boil alive? When all that I have done is live my life?”) But Davidson was defiant. He wanted his lobster. It was on the menu, after all. This meant more “Les Misérables,” including a parody of “Do You Hear the People Sing?” by a group of revolutionaries at the barricades. (“When the churning in your bowels matches the burning of his shell, you’ll know why lobsters in a diner never sell!”) We’re filing Jack White’s performances this week squarely under “What Was That?” And we like Jack White. His first song was “Over and Over and Over,” from his new album “Boarding House Reach.” It was a bit strange and disjointed — but this is Jack White, after all. By the end, it was a runaway freight train. A version of this article appears in print on April 16, 2018, on Page C4 of the New York edition with the headline: Skewering President Trump’s Personal Lawyer on ‘S.N.L.’.

Washington,381," Supported by By The New York Times A heavily armed young man opened fire on terrified students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday, leaving a death toll of 17. It is the third mass shooting in the past four months in the United States.   This pattern has led to a familiar cycle of mourning, introspection and questioning about what can be done to end the violence. Below is a selection of six stories The Times has previously reported around these shootings that give context to this latest tragedy and best inform conversations about the trends in gun violence and potential gun policy considerations.  When a gunman killed 20 first graders and six adults with an assault rifle at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, it rattled Newtown, Conn., and reverberated across the world. Since then, there have been at least 239 school shootings nationwide. In those episodes, 438 people were shot, 138 of whom were killed. Read the full story here.  The military-style weapon has also been the gun of choice in several other mass shootings: at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.; at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.; at a holiday party for county health workers in San Bernardino, Calif.; and at the campus of Umpqua Community College in Oregon. But the National Rifle Association has taken to calling the AR-15 “America’s rifle.” Though the federal government does not keep track of exactly how many AR-15s are in circulation, experts estimate that there are easily several million in the nation’s rifle racks and gun safes — a huge number, given that the gun, along with other so-called assault weapons, was banned under federal law from 1994 to 2004. Read the full story here.  A vast majority of guns used in 18 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check. At least nine gunmen had criminal histories or documented mental health problems that did not prevent them from obtaining their weapons. Read the full story here.  Fear of gun-buying restrictions has been the main driver of spikes in gun sales, far surpassing the effects of mass shootings and terrorist attacks alone, according to an analysis of federal background check data by The New York Times. Read the full story here.  Gun violence researchers say that no law can eliminate the risk of mass shootings, which are unpredictable and represent a small minority of gun homicides over all. But there are a handful of policies that could reduce the likelihood of such events, or reduce the number of people killed when such shootings do occur. And several of them have strong public support. Read the full story here.  An ever-growing body of research consistently reaches the same conclusion. The only variable that can explain the high rate of mass shootings in America is its astronomical number of guns. Read the full story here.

NYTNow,382," By KAREN ZRAICK and SANDRA STEVENSONMARCH 9, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “The fact that he would want to look the guy in the eye is very Trumpian.” That was a national security scholar at the Heritage Foundation on President Trump’s decision to meet with Kim Jong-un of North Korea in the next two months. Above, people walked by a news broadcast in Tokyo. Our Interpreter columnist says that in the short term, planned talks reduce the chance of war. But that doesn’t mean they’ll result in a deal to dismantle the North’s nuclear program. And we looked at the South Korean leader bringing Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim together. That’s President Moon Jae-in, whom Mr. Trump once accused of “appeasement.” ____ 2. It was jobs report day, and the data far exceeded expectations. The country added 313,000 jobs in February, and the jobless rate stayed at 4.1 percent. Above, a job fair in Washington last year.  Stocks were up on the news, and our economics correspondent said the “blockbuster job growth” suggested the economy, already nine years into an expansion, might yet have room to run. ____ 3. If a porn-tinged hush payment falls in a news din already torqued to maximum volume, does it make a sound? That’s the question our reporter’s asking about the Stormy Daniels story.  A lawsuit filed by the adult film star, above, who says she had an affair with President Trump years ago, opens what could be a precarious legal front for him. On “The Daily,” we discuss the elaborate systems developed to silence women who level accusations against powerful men. ____ 4. Gov. Rick Scott of Florida signed firearm restrictions into law, breaking with the N.R.A. in a state known for gun rights. The $400 million Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act raises the minimum age to buy a gun to 21, bans “bump stocks” and funds school police officers and mental health services. But it also allows some staff members to carry guns in schools. “You made your voices heard,” he told students from Parkland. “You helped change your state. You made a difference. You should be proud.” ____ 5. Martin Shkreli, the “Pharma Bro” who became notorious for sharply increasing drug prices — and his sneering defenses of his actions — was sentenced to seven years in prison for fraud.  The convictions stemmed from his involvement with Retrophin, a pharmaceutical company he founded in 2011, and two hedge funds he ran. A federal judge authorized the government to seize Mr. Shkreli’s assets, including a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album, if he was unable to come up with $7.36 million in restitution. ____ 6. Rebel snipers are preventing civilians from fleeing an enclave near Damascus that is under brutal aerial assault by Syrian government forces. We talked to a U.N. official who entered the area with a relief convoy this week. He said that even if civilians could leave, they might choose to stay. They fear for their safety in government-held territory, and worry they’d never be allowed to return home. ____ 7. For years, many majority-white megachurches around the country had been trying to become more diverse, and finding some success. Above, Gateway Church in Southlake, Tex. Then came the 2016 election. As white churchgoers, especially evangelicals, cheered the outcome, black worshipers began to trickle away. In this essay, our reporter explains how he came upon the story — and how it made him think back to the little Baptist church he grew up in. ____ 8. The Winter Paralympics began in Pyeongchang with a glittering performance that championed coexistence. Above, the American team.  A record 567 athletes will participate in 10 days of competition in Alpine skiing, biathlon, cross-country skiing, Para ice hockey, snowboarding and wheelchair curling. Unlike at the Olympic opening ceremony, North and South Korea entered the stadium separately, after failing to agree on conditions for a dual march. ____ 9. A new photography show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York moves away from “navel-gazing digital obsession” to explore reality-based portraiture, politics and gender. “Being” features 17 artists, all under 45, and proved to our writer that “old-fashioned photography in the hands of an artist can feel completely up-to-date.” Above, Stephanie Syjuco’s “Cargo Cults: Cover-Up.” The staged self-portrait questions how Western manufacturers both appropriate and create “primitive” designs. ____ 10. Finally, this week in good news, we report on a penguin supercolony, the indigenous athletes “decolonizing” the Roller Derby World Cup, above, and a 131-year-old message in a bottle, found on a beach in Australia. On the late-night shows, the hosts had to scramble to account for news of the unexpected agreement between Kim Jong-un and President Trump. “This can only mean one thing. Dennis Rodman is going to get the Nobel Peace Prize,” Stephen Colbert joked. And a friendly reminder: Daylight saving time starts on Sunday. (Florida wants to “spring forward” all year round.)

                        FEB. 19, 2018 For the past year, chief executives have often talked about the new sense of moral responsibility that corporations have to help their communities and confront social challenges even when Washington won’t. In the aftermath of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 students and staff members — and at a time when Washington shows little interest in limiting the sales of assault weapons — there’s a real opportunity for the business community to fill the void and prove that all that talk about moral responsibility isn’t hollow. Here’s an idea. What if the finance industry — credit card companies like Visa, Mastercard and American Express; credit card processors like First Data; and banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo — were to effectively set new rules for the sales of guns in America? Collectively, they have more leverage over the gun industry than any lawmaker. And it wouldn’t be hard for them to take a stand.  PayPal, Square, Stripe and Apple Pay announced years ago that they would not allow their services to be used for the sale of firearms.  “We do not believe permitting the sale of firearms on our platform is consistent with our values or in the best interests of our customers,” a spokesman for Square told me. The big financial firms don’t even have to go that far. For example, Visa, which published a 71-page paper in 2016 espousing its “corporate responsibility,” could easily change its terms of service to say that it won’t do business with retailers that sell assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, which make semiautomatic rifles fire faster. (Even the National Rifle Association has said it would support tighter restrictions on bump stocks.) If Mastercard were to do the same, assault weapons would be eliminated from virtually every firearms store in America because otherwise the sellers would be cut off from the credit card system. There is precedent for credit card issuers to ban the purchase of completely legal products. Just this month, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America banned the use of their cards to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. To be clear: Those three banks won’t let you use your credit card to buy Bitcoin, but they will happily let you use it to buy an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle — the same kind of gun used in mass shootings in Parkland; Newtown, Conn.; San Bernardino, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex. Visa, oddly enough, is the card of choice of the N.R.A.: There is actually an N.R.A.-branded Visa card issued by First Bankcard, a division of First National Bank of Omaha. And Mastercard proudly announced last year that it was the branded card for Cabela’s, an outdoor gear megastore with a seemingly limitless assault-weapon catalog. Visa spokesmen did not reply to several emails seeking comment. A spokesman for Mastercard sent a boilerplate statement that expressed “disgust with recent events, including last week in Florida.”  “Our payments network is governed by standards that have been established over time,” the statement said. “Chief among these is that we do not and will not permit merchants to engage in unlawful activity on our network.” He said the company would continue to talk to customers and lawmakers about its policies. If Visa and Mastercard are unwilling to act on this issue, the credit card processors and banks that issue credit cards could try. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, which issues credit cards and owns a payment processor, has talked about how he and his bank have “a moral obligation but also a deeply vested interest” in helping “solve pressing societal challenges.” This is your chance, Mr. Dimon. And here’s a variation on the same theme: What if the payment processing industry’s biggest customers — companies like McDonald’s, Starbucks, Apple, Amazon, AT&T, CVS and others that regularly talk about “social responsibility” — collectively pressured the industry to do it? There’s a chance that some of the payment processors would stop handling gun sales. Perhaps their voices would help push one of the banks to step out and lead? Is all of this a pipe dream? Maybe, but I spent the last 72 hours calling and emailing a handful of chief executives to discuss these ideas. None wanted to speak on the record, because it’s a hot-button topic. But all applauded the idea and some said they had already been thinking about it. A few, I discovered later, called their peers to begin a conversation. At least two executives said a reason that they haven’t been more outspoken yet is that they fear reprisals from the N.R.A. and other gun supporters — not just in the form of boycotts that could affect their bottom line, but also actions that could imperil the safety of their employees. Obviously there would be opposition. When Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, was asked at a conference about his former company’s decision to not do business with firearms merchants, he made his displeasure clear. “No, I wouldn’t be doing that if I was still running it,” said Mr. Thiel, who left the company years ago and is a supporter of President Trump.      Perhaps the biggest stumbling block to an approach like this are companies like Walmart, which has huge sway over the financial industry. While Walmart stopped selling assault rifles in 2015, it might look askance at any policy by a bank issuer or credit card company to limit the kinds of products it sells. Critics of using the finance industry to influence gun sales might argue that such a move would be discriminatory against gun retailers. But gun sellers are not a protected class, like age, race, gender, religion or even political affiliation. This would be a strictly commercial decision. Another critique is that it is impossible to prevent every shooting, no matter how guns are restricted. And the banks’ actions would affect millions of their own law-abiding customers, effectively dictating what they can and cannot buy.  The most troubling aspect of having the finance industry try to restrict gun sales is that it would push the most dangerous guns into an untraceable world where sales would depend on cash. That’s true. All things considered, though, it would make it considerably harder to even find such guns. There are other sectors of the finance industry that could step up. For example, Lloyd’s of London is the favored insurance company for gun shows. It could pull out. None of this is a panacea. But it’s a start. It takes leadership and courage — exactly what these executives say they have. If they don’t want to back up their words with actions, the next time there’s a school shooting that prompts a conversation about gun companies, it should also include the financial complex that supports them.

NYTNow,384," By KAREN ZRAICK and SANDRA STEVENSONAPRIL 10, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Among the things that the F.B.I. was looking for when it raided the office of President Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, above, on Monday: records of payments to two women who say they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Several people briefed on the investigation told us the agents were also seeking information related to the publisher of The National Enquirer’s role in silencing one of the women, the former Playboy model Karen McDougal. We’re following the many strands of this story, including the dangers to the president as investigators sift through his lawyer’s communications, Mr. Trump’s reported rage and his aides’ concerns that he will fire justice officials. Today on our podcast “The Daily,” Matt Apuzzo, who covers law enforcement for us, explains how he broke the story, and what it means.  ____ 2. Mark Zuckerberg, in a suit and tie, met an army of cardboard look-alikes in “Fix Fakebook” T-shirts, above, when he arrived on Capitol Hill to testify before a joint session of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees. We’re following the hearing here.  Much of the focus was on Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm linked to the Trump campaign. The hearing was called after The Times, working with The Observer of London, revealed that the firm harvested data from tens of millions of Facebook users to psychologically profile voters. Mr. Zuckerberg faces a second day of questioning, before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on Wednesday. ____ 3. President Trump canceled a trip to South America as he and U.S. allies weighed retaliation over the suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria. Above, he met with the emir of Qatar at the Oval Office. Our Interpreter columnist argues that the U.S. has three options for military action in Syria, and none are good. “You can tell there’s something odd about this conversation by the fact that it’s barely changed between the Obama and Trump administrations,” he writes. Meanwhile, the fighting goes on. The U.N. said that more than 133,000 people have fled eastern Ghouta, where the latest suspected chemical attack took place, amid a government offensive. ____ 4. Volkswagen is set to oust its chief executive, Matthias Müller, above, as it grapples with the fallout from its diesel emissions scandal. The company admitted in 2015 that it used illegal software to cheat on diesel emissions tests on millions of vehicles. The revelations cost it billions of dollars, led to the imprisonment of two executives, and did immense damage to the German carmaker’s reputation.  Herbert Diess, who is in charge of Volkswagen, the company’s flagship brand, is seen as likely to succeed Mr. Müller. ____ 5. Jamie Allman, a conservative commentator for a St. Louis TV station, above, resigned after saying on Twitter that he was preparing to use a “hot poker” to assault David Hogg, a 17-year-old survivor of the Parkland shooting. The station is owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, the country’s largest broadcaster, which is already facing controversy over widely shared videos of anchors at dozens of stations reciting the same script about bias in the media. ____ 6. For the first time in 60 years, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has reached beyond its own doors for a new leader. Max Hollein, 48, currently the director and chief executive of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and a veteran of Germany’s oldest art foundation, will become its 10th director this summer. Born in Vienna, he is conversant in the old masters, modern art and Minecraft too. Now he’ll have to steer the venerable institution through the digital age. ____ 7. Professional cheerleaders say groping and sexual harassment are basically part of the job. In addition to performing on the field, they are required to interact with fans at games and promotional events — even at tailgating parties. Above, cheerleaders for the Saints last year. In interviews with dozens of current and former cheerleaders — most of them from the N.F.L., but also representing the N.B.A. and the N.H.L. — they described systematic exploitation by teams sending them into crowds of intoxicated men.  “When you have on a push-up bra and a fringed skirt, it can sometimes, unfortunately, feel like it comes with the territory,” said one. ____ 8. Our “52 Places” writer went to Bogotá, No. 2 on our 2018 list of 52 places to travel. The Colombian capital is “not a colonial jewel of the Caribbean like Cartagena, or a hot spot like Medellín — Pablo Escobar’s former home base,” she noted. But she found rich culture, food and sightseeing, and pronounced herself enamored. ____ 9. Fear the reaper.  An upstate New York man ate a whole Carolina Reaper — the hottest pepper in the world, according to Guinness World Records — as part of an ill-advised competition. Apparently extra-sensitive to the compound that causes the pepper’s burn, he ended up in the hospital with a “thunderclap” headache — thanks to temporarily narrowed arteries — that went on for days. We’re happy to report that he made a full recovery. ____ 10. Finally, a very different serving for your mental taste buds: “mind-numbingly predictable” ice cream sundaes. “You may be asking yourself: What kind of sociopath complains about ice cream sundaes?” our food writer asks, perhaps presciently. But he sees them as a crutch for restaurants that have let their pastry chefs go. (Hint: His story is open for comments.) On the late-night shows, the raid on Mr. Trump’s lawyer was inescapable. Stephen Colbert’s shot: “Future generations will learn all about it in the Trump presidential library’s adult section.” Have a great night. ____ Get a nightly rundown of the day’s top stories, delivered to your inbox every Monday through Friday.

                APRIL 13, 2018 Reading a middle-grade novel can feel like opening Pandora’s box. Devastating storms. Racial injustice. Violence, divorce, bullying, class conflict, depression, displacement, illness, grief, homophobia, abandonment, isolation, money worries and suicide attempts. That swarm of afflictions — all of them released from these four new books — might seem extreme, but the world doesn’t always spare children. The students of Parkland, Fla., know this well. In my daughters’ school, children are mourning a beloved first grader who died from complications of the flu. Her friends are 5, 6, 7 — too young to face such grief, we think helplessly, except that suddenly they must. Fiction gives children a chance to encounter loss gently, on the page, and to see how different characters find their way forward. Some measure of a book’s success, then, might be how deftly it explores that pain — and what small winged creatures it might offer young readers alongside it, in the form of solace, courage, strength, patience, pride, resistance and hope. Or maybe even secret treasure? In Varian Johnson’s THE PARKER INHERITANCE (Scholastic, 331 pp., $16.99; ages 8 to 12), 12-year-old Candice Miller faces “a horrible summer” away from her friends and her father in Atlanta. After her parents’ divorce, she and her mother have decamped to her grandmother’s house in South Carolina, where Candice learns that her grandmother, who died two years before, was at the center of a city scandal, digging up tennis courts in search of buried treasure. This is the first hint that Candice won’t be as bored as she imagines with nothing but library books, an iPod with her father’s “ancient” music, and the kid across the street for company: a year younger, “a book snob” and a boy. Johnson has written a powerful novel for readers who, like Candice, “love a good mystery.” Candice finds a letter with a clue to a $40 million treasure and a tantalizing note in her grandmother’s handwriting. Brandon, the boy across the street, reveals himself as a worthy ally with troubles of his own. They uncover a history of racial violence in the city of Lambert, including acts of vengeance against those who attacked an African-American family in 1957 and those who stood by and did nothing.  I love that “The Parker Inheritance” presents compelling arguments against doing nothing — and that Johnson’s characters move through a range of responses to racism, a powerful way to enlarge conversations about injustice. The premise of the mastermind who contrived a treasure hunt sometimes strains credulity, but Johnson writes about the long shadows of the past with such ambition that any reader with a taste for mystery will appreciate the puzzle Candice and Brandon must solve. (One wonderful touch: They make headway when they discover clues based on the classic middle-grade mystery “The Westing Game.”) Their adventure is also a quest for dignity and justice and a journey to understand each other. In a novel marked by scenes of pain and rage, their friendship, genuine and sustaining, is a great achievement. Friendship is at the heart of Vera Brosgol’s latest graphic novel, BE PREPARED (First Second, 244 pp., $16.99; ages 8 to 12). A catastrophic birthday sleepover persuades 8-year-old Vera, who left Russia at 5, that she will never “fit in with the American kids.” But Vera is a comeback kid. With charming optimism, she lobbies her mother to let her spend the summer the way her well-off classmates do: at sleepaway camp. Best of all, it’s “Russian camp,” for immigrants, where Vera is bound to find her tribe. Her little brother is dragged along to become a reluctant wolf pup: collateral camp damage.  Because camp is not what Vera imagined. Excessive marching, wild animals, kitchen duty, a looming scout test, nighttime raids, an evil-smelling latrine and 14-year-old bunkmates, both named Sasha, with no time for small girls who don’t wear bras. Vera must speak and sing in Russian, bathe in a creek, attend Orthodox services in a downpour. Even her brother the wolf pup ignores her. Still, she doesn’t give up. “Camp is O.K.,” she writes home gamely, requesting bug spray while reporting that she has no friends yet. “Be Prepared” is a complete delight, from the first sly jokes about the American Girl-ish doll Complicity to Brosgol’s evocative artwork, which ranges from droll to wistful to outright lovely. Vera is a heroine for the ages, enduring day after lonely, buggy day without losing her spirit, compassion or love of beauty. Her sincerity is a beacon in the darkest latrine. Her triumphs are subtle and richly deserved. And her struggles are an eloquent reminder that even without outright tragedy, childhood is filled with challenges, cruelties and opportunities for courage. Ivy Aberdeen is another girl of spirit, living with her parents, twin baby brothers and older sister, Layla, in the family home in rural Georgia — until a tornado rips their house away. That’s just the beginning of Ashley Herring Blake’s middle-grade debut, IVY ABERDEEN’S LETTER TO THE WORLD (Little, Brown, 307 pp., $17.99; ages 8 to 12). The title alludes to Emily Dickinson’s poem addressing a world “that never wrote to me,” raising questions about what we withhold from the people closest to us. In the aftermath of the storm, 12-year-old Ivy’s best comfort comes from drawing, until she befriends June. Same-sex attraction is rare in middle-grade fiction, so it’s gratifying to see the full arc of their relationship as Ivy’s feelings move beyond simple friendship. Blake captures all the exhilaration of a first crush without shying away from Ivy’s confusion and her worries about acceptance. Blake is adept at revealing how powerfully a misunderstanding can lodge in a child’s mind, and Ivy’s (mistaken) assumption about how her sister might react to her feelings for a girl adds another layer of tension to a family in crisis. The sisters’ relationship is one of the great rewards of this novel that includes a large and vivid cast of secondary characters, who give the story its sense of abundant texture. Set in St. Thomas, Kheryn Callender’s debut, HURRICANE CHILD (Scholastic, 211 pp., $16.99; ages 8 to 12), introduces 12-year-old Caroline, who faces storms of her own. Her schoolmates bully her. Her teacher torments her. Her mother disappeared over a year before, and the postcards have stopped coming. A girl turns up, claiming to be Caroline’s sister. Her father does not explain. And Caroline sees spirits without knowing what they intend. Caroline is a lively girl who hops off a shared taxi without paying and turns back to grin at the irate driver. But her predicament is bleak. She escapes to the schoolyard only to meet “a half circle” of girls who pelt her with rocks. Caroline’s principal offers a dash of warmth and understanding. But adult support is threadbare; her mother is gone and her father “has enough to worry about already.” At first, this novel seems to be about self-reliance, and the kind of anger that can help brace a person in terrible circumstances. Caroline, we learn early, won’t “cry after a bum smacking.” But she is innately loving, as memories of her mother make clear. Her friendship with a classmate, Kalinda, brings the first sign that Caroline’s future may brighten. Their connection is intense, but it’s only after encountering tourists from a cruise ship — two white women holding hands — that Caroline realizes she “would like to hold Kalinda’s hand too.”  This scene, delicate and straightforward, bears the twin revelations that Caroline is falling for Kalinda, and that Kalinda regards same-sex couples as wrong. Their journey toward understanding is harrowing but rewarding, because of all the dangers in this novel — from hurricanes to hauntings — the greatest by far is isolation. When Caroline risks heartbreak and scorn to tell Kalinda how she feels, most readers will understand why. They will also know why Caroline embarks on a perilous search for her mother. The stakes are high, the revelations are serious and Callender doesn’t sugarcoat. But readers who face troubles of their own may recognize Caroline’s fierce resolve: Others may be “fine with letting go of people they love,” but she is not. It’s not a soft or gentle vision; these are not circumstances anyone wants children to face. But Caroline’s insistence on love, no matter what, might be just what young readers need to see.

                APRIL 10, 2018 Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) In 2015, landlords filed 51,203 eviction cases in Los Angeles County. That number sounds high, but it represents a relatively small share — roughly 3 percent — of all renter households in the county. New national data compiled by the Princeton sociologist Matthew Desmond, author of “Evicted,” suggests that America’s worst eviction epidemics are not in expensive, coastal cities. Rather, eviction is routine in Indiana and Michigan, and across the Southeast. California has far steeper housing costs. But the state also has a stronger safety net and more tenant protections. The New York Times traveled to Richmond, Va., an unlikely epicenter of eviction, to see what happens when one community has so much housing instability. There, landlords file about three eviction cases for every 10 renter households, or 10 times the rate in Los Angeles County. One in five renter households in Richmond are pulled into this legal system, and one in nine walk away with a lasting eviction judgment. With these numbers, based on 83 million court records dating to 2000, Mr. Desmond is trying to map for the first time where eviction is most acute. But his national picture is incomplete.  In California, we have a good sense from court-reported data collected by the state of how many cases are filed each year. But Mr. Desmond can’t say what share result in legal judgments because of another protection California tenants have: Many eviction court records are sealed from public view (concealing them from future landlords, but researchers, too).  We do know, however, that even across the Bay Area, eviction filing rates are nowhere near the nation’s worst. But that doesn’t mean the problem isn’t severe for the households that experience it. “If you get evicted from San Francisco, is that much more of a consequential thing for your relocation strategies than if you get evicted from Cleveland?” Mr. Desmond asked. “You can find another low-income apartment in Cleveland. But you cannot in San Francisco.” (Read more on evictions here.) The news and stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state). Sign up to get it by email.

Upshot,387," Supported by A Republican polling surge has faded. It’s another example of how seeming political shifts have proved ephemeral. By Nate Cohn There are still 243 days until the midterm elections. There’s plenty of time for events to reshape the race for control of Congress.  But despite plenty of developments over the previous 243 days — with seemingly endless mobile news alerts and presidential tweets — it is hard to say that the national political environment has changed.  President Trump’s approval rating has been very stable. The generic congressional ballot, which asks voters which party they’ll support for Congress, has been more volatile over short periods, but the big shifts have proved ephemeral.  It was only a month ago that Republicans seemed to post substantial gains on the generic congressional ballot. They had pulled five percentage points behind Democrats by some measures after a Monmouth poll showed Democrats up by just two. That led to a wave of articles declaring that the Republican tax plan and strong economic growth had revitalized the party’s fortunes.  In February, it was hard to know whether the Republican surge would last.  A little over a month  later, Democrats have recovered. The most recent Monmouth poll, published on Wednesday, gave Democrats a nine-point lead. Over all, Democrats lead the most recent generic ballot polls by around nine points, about the same as their standing before the tax debate began. There’s nothing new about a short-term swing in the polls that fails to cause a big change in a race. So far this year, just about every big shift in the generic ballot has proved short-lived.  Highly sensitive, short-term estimates have misled much more often than they’ve presaged a lasting change.  Democrats have generally maintained a consistent lead of seven to nine points in a less sensitive, longer-term estimate of the generic congressional ballot. As a historical matter,  the generic ballot tends to be stable over the longer term.  But the stability is perhaps more surprising in light of the events of the last six months. Since early July, the Republican health care bill has been defeated, revived and defeated again. The special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted more than 20 people. The Republicans have passed a sweeping tax cut. There was the violent far-right rally in Charlottesville, Va.; national anthem protests; the birth of the “Me Too” movement; as well as mass shootings in Las Vegas and Parkland, Fla. The government shut down. The stock market surged. ISIS was routed. Who knows how many times the president tweeted. Many of these events seemed to inch the polls toward one side, for at least a little bit. Perhaps some of these events would have had a lasting effect on the race if they hadn’t been superseded by a new round of breaking news. But whatever the reason, none of these events produced a lasting shift.  The news hasn’t had a lasting effect on the president’s approval rating, either. Although it has been easy to cherry-pick poll numbers that seem to imply that the president’s ratings are perpetually pushing new lows, or new highs, his approval rating has remained stable for months.  Today, his average approval rating sits around 40 percent, and it hasn’t deviated much more than three points from that figure in either direction since he fired the F.B.I. director James Comey in May. The fact that the national political environment has been so stable for so long doesn’t mean that modest movement wouldn’t be important. By most estimates, Democrats probably need a seven-point lead in the national popular vote to have a 50-50 chance to retake the House. So the difference between a seven-point lead and a nine-point lead on the generic congressional ballot is potentially quite significant.  There’s plenty of precedent for late movement on the generic congressional ballot, whether as a result of likely-voter screens or as part of a more general tendency for voters to break against the president’s party in midterm elections.  But the fact that a shift would be important doesn’t necessarily justify hanging on to every apparent movement in the polls, or on to every news story that might bring about movement. Even the biggest swings in the polls, like the Democratic surge in December, or the Republican one in late January, faded in a few weeks.  That leads to a pretty good rule of thumb. This far from an election, it’s not too useful to focus on a shift in the polls that hasn’t lasted for over a month. So far in this cycle, no shift has.

Culture,388," By BEN BRANTLEYAPRIL 9, 2018 The time, it seems, has finally arrived for a certain father-daughter talk, the kind of conversation that parents dread. But for Dan, a single dad, and Julie, a very unworldly 13-year-old, the subject isn’t the awkward Topic A that has fueled so many frantic scenes in sitcoms. It’s not the mysteries of sex that are on Julie’s mind. What this particular teenager is demanding is that her father explain why school shootings happen and why grown-ups can’t do anything about them. Julie, it turns out, is a recent survivor of such a tragedy, and she has just learned, by sneaking a peek at a forbidden newspaper, that what happened in her school is not an uncommon event. “Dad, has this happened before?” she asks, the alarm rising in her voice. “How many times?” Portrayed by the young actress Ella Kennedy Davis, Julie is the troubled and troubling center of “This Flat Earth,” Lindsey Ferrentino’s very sincere and equally ungainly new drama. There is no denying the urgency of this work, which opened on Monday night at Playwrights Horizons, less than two months after the killings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.  It seems unlikely that any student of Julie’s age would be as naïve as she appears to be. Yet something like the hour of reckoning portrayed in this 90-minute, five-character play, directed by Rebecca Taichman, is surely happening every day, all over the world.  More than ever, coming of age these days means coming to terms with the possibility that sudden, irrational violence may disrupt and extinguish lives that are just beginning. The typical worries of entering adolescence have, it seems, acquired newly terrifying mortal shadows. Born in the late 1980s, the prolific Ms. Ferrentino has already established herself as a dramatist willing to wrestle with overpowering contemporary subjects. Her “Ugly Lies the Bone” (2015) dealt with the effects post-traumatic stress disorder on a young American veteran and her family, and this season’s “Amy and the Orphans” considers the irreparable effects of the parental abandonment of children with Down syndrome. “This Flat Earth” may be her most daring venture to date. For Ms. Ferrentino winds up venturing far beyond the precincts of everyday naturalism in which her latest play initially seems to be operating. She is bravely attempting to contextualize 21st-century horrors within the sort of existential framework in which Thornton Wilder and Edward Albee specialized. By the end of “This Flat Earth,” Julie comes to seem like a latter-day variation on Emily, the heroine of Wilder’s “Our Town,” who is vouchsafed a glimpse of small human lives within a cosmic framework. Unfortunately, before we arrive at this moment of out-of-time revelation, we are stuck in a long and unconvincing slice of life. The ambitious, potentially heart-stirring elements are all in place here. Yet they have been assembled with a disjointedness that taxes our belief. And the performances, perhaps inevitably, lack emotional continuity. Set in a shabby apartment building in a New England town (Dane Laffrey did the impressive two-story set), “This Flat Earth” begins resonantly in the dead of night, when Julie wakens to cry out, “Are you there?” Her father, Dan (Lucas Papaelias), who works for the local water company, comes in to reassure her that there is nothing to fear in the sounds she hears — the wind, the rain, the traffic and, most ominously to Julie’s ear, a recording of a Bach cello suite being played upstairs. It gradually emerges that on that very day Julie has attended the reopening ceremony of her public school, where a shooting occurred not long before. (The time frame is kept vague, as are the details of the killing.)      The one student who died whom Julie knew was Noelle, a rich girl who played the cello. Julie didn’t particularly like Noelle, which makes dealing with what happened all the more complicated.  Noelle’s grief-addled mother, Lisa (Cassie Beck), shows up at Julie’s apartment, after Dan agrees to hold on to some boxes belonging to the dead girl. And Julie, it emerges, had earlier bought Noelle’s designer discards at a Goodwill store. While Julie and her friend Zander (Ian Saint-Germain) hide out in her room, watching horror movies on his laptop and innocently flirting, all escapism is only provisional. It doesn’t help that Cloris (Lynda Gravátt), the old woman who lives upstairs, keeps playing that cello record. (The music is performed live by the cellist Christine H. Kim.) Or that, for reasons that have nothing to with the recent tragedy, Julie may soon have to leave her school. The assorted plot elements and themes, which include social and economic resentment, are presented spasmodically. And while it may be Ms. Ferrentino’s point that people behave atypically in extreme situations, the disjointed and inconsistent behavior of most of the characters keeps you at a perplexed distance. For starters, could any 13-year-old of reasonable intelligence be as out of touch with the world as Julie is? Would she and the savvier Zander really engineer such a strained and hokey scheme to help Julie stay in school? Would the upper-middle-class Lisa, even in her distress, look to the blue-collar Dan for support as she does? Perhaps less-wholesale realism might reconcile some of the play’s more far-fetched contrivances. Ms. Taichman, who won a Tony last year for her inventive direction of Paula Vogel’s “Indecent,” hasn’t found a tone that would smooth over the ostensible disparities here. That’s a shame, because Ms. Ferrentino is dealing with profound and essential subjects. That includes how we incorporate the monumental and horrific into the steadily flowing banalities and necessities of daily life. For parents, the most affecting issue may be how adults can never entirely comfort children as they begin to realize that many of life’s scariest problems are neither avoidable or fixable. And that when a little girl cries out “Are you there?” in the night, there won’t always be someone to answer.

National,389," By PATRICIA MAZZEIAPRIL 9, 2018 MIAMI — Gov. Rick Scott made official on Monday what Floridians have suspected for months: He is running for the United States Senate against Bill Nelson, the incumbent Democrat, in a premier race that will return the nation’s largest swing state to its familiar role as the political vortex of a tumultuous election year. “This is going to be a lot of fun,” Mr. Scott, wearing his usual Navy baseball cap, said in an announcement on Facebook Live from an Orlando construction company, before embarking on the kind of statewide tour that has become his signature over two terms as governor. “We’re going to make sure that Washington works for us.” With his formal entry into the campaign, Mr. Scott, a 65-year-old Republican, made Florida a centerpiece of the midterm elections, featuring one of the most expensive Senate races in the country, as well as an open governor’s race and up to a half-dozen competitive House races. The contest between Mr. Nelson and Mr. Scott alone is expected to cost $100 million, or even much more, chiefly from spending on television advertising across Florida’s 10 broadcast media markets. Mr. Scott, a multimillionaire former health care executive, invested millions of his own money into his successful campaigns for governor in 2010 and 2014. The Florida Senate battle will be a microcosm of national Republicans’ fight to keep control of Congress under President Trump, whose policies and demeanor have invigorated Democratic voters. Mr. Nelson is one of 10 Democratic senators seeking re-election in states Mr. Trump won in 2016, and Republicans have repeatedly bested Democrats in most statewide Florida midterm races since 2006 — though Mr. Nelson’s win was one of two Democratic victories that year.  Since the 2000 presidential recount, Florida has become a perennial must-win state for both parties. Mr. Trump’s campaign focused heavily on the state in 2016, and Republican leaders in Congress were so fearful of losing the Senate that year that they persuaded Senator Marco Rubio, who had announced his retirement to begin his own unsuccessful presidential bid, to seek re-election.  Democrats need to flip two seats to piece together a majority in 2018. They have more competitive seats to defend than Republicans and cannot afford to lose Mr. Nelson, said Nathan Gonzales, the editor of Inside Elections. “If Democrats lose in Florida, it puts pressure on the party to win in much more Republican territory — in states such as Texas or Tennessee or Nebraska,” Mr. Gonzales said. Mr. Scott’s candidacy leaves Democrats with no choice but to divert time and money to Florida, where elections are close even in years in which national races are not as competitive. Former President Barack Obama won re-election comfortably in 2012, but only by one percentage point in Florida, for example. “I’ve always run every race like there’s no tomorrow — regardless of my opponent,” Mr. Nelson said in a statement on Monday. “While it’s clear that Rick Scott will say or do anything to get elected, I’ve always believed that if you just do the right thing, the politics will take care of itself.” National Democrats already knew they would have to invest 2018 resources into the open governor’s race to replace the term-limited Mr. Scott. Democrats last held the governorship 20 years ago. Mr. Trump has endorsed Representative Ron DeSantis of Palm Coast in the Republican primary. At the House level, the party also has targeted three seats held by Republican representatives in South Florida: Carlos Curbelo of Miami, Brian Mast of Palm City and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Miami, who is retiring. Democrats consider two other Republican-held seats in play, though they would be a bigger reach for the party. Republicans, for their part, are targeting two Democrats: Representatives Stephanie Murphy of Orlando and Charlie Crist of St. Petersburg. 
                A full list of elections for the House and Senate, including which races matter most for congressional control.             “The last three midterm elections have all been referendums of the president,” said Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist in Tallahassee. Mr. Schale cautioned that the dynamics of the 2018 race would be fluid until October, but added: “If you want to send a message to Trump, are you going to do it by voting for his biggest champion in the Southeast?”  In Mr. Scott, Mr. Nelson, 75, faces the toughest challenger of his Senate career, which began in 2001 after stints in the House and as the state’s appointed treasurer in Tallahassee. Despite his many years of political experience, Mr. Nelson remains unknown to some voters; a February poll conducted by the Jacksonville-based Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy found that 12 percent of respondents did not know the senator’s name, compared with 3 percent who did not recognize Mr. Scott’s. A Quinnipiac University poll of Florida voters found in February that Mr. Scott’s approval rating was at 49 percent, higher than ever in the survey, with 40 percent of respondents disapproving of his job performance. In a matchup with Mr. Nelson, the senator led by 46 to 42 percent, essentially a statistical tie given the poll’s margin of error.      Mr. Scott was written off by the Republican establishment when he began his first campaign for governor amid a Tea Party wave. He poured $73 million into the race, and his relentless jobs message won him the governor’s mansion by a single percentage point over Alex Sink. He repeated his success in 2014, defeating Mr. Crist, again by a one-point margin. But Democrats note that Mr. Scott did not crack 50 percent of the vote in either race, suggesting he failed to excite as many voters in the Republican base as past candidates in years more favorable to the party than 2018. Florida Democrats have been on a rare streak since September, winning a swing State Senate district in Miami, the mayor’s office in St. Petersburg and a Republican-leaning House district in Sarasota. “Scott has also never run weighed down by an unpopular G.O.P. president and Congress,” Mindy Myers, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in a statement outlining her party’s case against the governor. “This dynamic is sparking a backlash against G.O.P. candidates and deprives him of his traditional campaign message.” The president has publicly encouraged Mr. Scott, though the governor did not mention Mr. Trump in his announcement — possibly to distance himself from the problematic national political environment. In Orlando on Monday, Mr. Scott continued to cast himself as a confident outsider ready to upend the political status quo, despite seven years in Tallahassee in which he aligned himself with traditional Republican interests. “I didn’t fit into Tallahassee because I didn’t play the insider games,” Mr. Scott said, surrounded by supporters and declining to take questions from reporters. “I never intended to fit into Tallahassee and, guess what? I’m not going to fit into Washington, either.”  Unencumbered by a primary, since no major Republican has appeared eager to take on the wealthy and undefeated governor in an expensive Senate race, Mr. Scott was able to use his announcement to reach out to the more moderate voters he will need in the general election. He stood next to Andrew Pollack, the father of one of the students killed in a mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in February. Mr. Pollack helped lobby state lawmakers to pass gun control legislation that Mr. Scott signed last month, in defiance of the National Rifle Association. The governor was introduced by Luis Rivera Marín, the secretary of state of Puerto Rico, who made the trip to Orlando, a Puerto Rican stronghold that could see thousands of Hurricane Maria refugees register to vote before November. “We will be forever grateful to you, governor, for your knowledge on how to handle an emergency,” Mr. Rivera Marín said. Mr. Scott offered a few sentences in the serviceable Spanish he learned before his 2014 re-election. Often a man of few words, he spoke for a total of about 15 minutes, without a stage, lectern or visible script. He recalled being raised by a single mother, his marriage to his high school sweetheart and his unlikely political career. He said he would run in part on setting term limits for members of Congress. “I will bust my butt to win this election,” he said. Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.

Washington,390," By KATIE ROGERS and MAGGIE HABERMANFEB. 18, 2018 WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump began the weekend believing that something good had just happened to him. An indictment leveled against 13 Russians for interfering with the 2016 election had not accused him or anyone around him of wrongdoing. “No collusion” was his refrain. But once ensconced at his Florida estate on Friday, Mr. Trump, facing long hours indoors as he avoided breezy rounds of golf after last week’s school shooting a few miles away, began watching TV. The president’s mood began to darken as it became clearer to him that some commentators were portraying the indictment as nothing for him to celebrate, according to three people with knowledge of his reaction. Those commentators called it proof that he had not won the election on his own, a particularly galling, if not completely accurate, charge for a president long concerned about his legitimacy. What followed was a two-day Twitter tirade that was unusually angry and defiant even by Mr. Trump’s standards. In his tweets on Sunday, Mr. Trump sought to shift the blame to Democrats for Russia’s meddling, saying that President Barack Obama had not done enough to stop the interference.  The president denied — despite the ample evidence to the contrary — that he had ever suggested that Moscow might not have been involved. He called Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, a “monster.” And he asserted that the Russians were “laughing their asses off” because the efforts to investigate and combat Moscow’s meddling had only given the Russians what they wanted.  “If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S. then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams,” Mr. Trump wrote. The president’s outburst ended a relatively subdued period after the deaths of 17 people in the shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday. He spent the following days praising law enforcement officials and emergency responders, and calling officials in Florida to receive updates. Mr. Trump met with two shooting victims in an unannounced visit to a Florida hospital on Friday evening, White House officials said. As he shunned the golf course over the weekend (his predecessor had been criticized for golfing too soon after tragic events), he instead spent time mingling with his supporters, including Geraldo Rivera. Mr. Rivera said on Twitter on Sunday that he had seen firsthand that the president “was deeply affected” by the time he had spent with victims, “impressed by their courage” and “equally distressed by the savagery of their wounds.” But Mr. Trump also had time to stew over news coverage of the indictment against the Russians secured by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading an investigation into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia. And he was surrounded in Florida by people who are likely to share his grievances: his two oldest sons, as well as John F. Kelly, his chief of staff, and Dan Scavino Jr., the White House social media director, who often emulates his boss’s prose on Twitter. The indictment says that while the Russians began their scheme in 2014 with the goal of undermining the American democratic system, they eventually shifted their focus to trying to help elect Mr. Trump and disparage his opponent, Hillary Clinton. The president has repeatedly seized on the fact that the efforts started before he became a candidate, but he has glossed over the conclusion that they evolved toward supporting his candidacy. The indictment does not assert any wrongdoing by the president or anyone affiliated with him, saying that some members of the Trump campaign were unwitting in their contacts with the Russian effort. It is also silent about whether the Russian campaign affected the election results.  Mr. Trump has long fought the idea that Moscow’s efforts might have influenced the election, branding it as a “hoax” perpetrated by Democrats embarrassed about losing to him. He has made little if any public effort to rally the nation to confront the Russians for their intrusion. The president’s Twitter eruption began late Saturday night, when he accused the F.B.I. of having missed signals that could have prevented the school shooting because it was “spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.”      He then lashed out at his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, who had said at a security conference in Germany on Saturday that the indictment provided “incontrovertible” evidence that Russia had interfered in the American democratic system. Mr. Trump said his adviser had “forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems.” The nation’s intelligence agencies believe that it is not possible to make such a calculation about the election outcome. Then, on Sunday, Mr. Trump said that he had “never said Russia did not meddle in the election,” quoting a comment he had made in a 2016 presidential debate. “I said ‘it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer,” Mr. Trump wrote. “The Russian ‘hoax’ was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia — it never did!” Yet he has repeatedly denied that Russia was behind any meddling, going so far in November as to suggest that he believed President Vladimir V. Putin’s denials of interference over the conclusions of American intelligence agencies. Mr. Trump also called Mr. Schiff, the California congressman, “Liddle Adam Schiff” and branded him “the leakin’ monster of no control,” even as he praised him for his criticism of Mr. Obama’s muted response to the Russian threat. The president in the past has traded bitter Twitter messages with Mr. Schiff, accusing him of leaking classified information from the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Russia’s actions. Mr. Schiff shot back at Mr. Trump on Sunday, saying on Twitter that “if McMaster can stand up to Putin, why can’t you?”  Initially, Mr. Trump had been swayed by advisers who described the indictment announced on Friday as a victory for him, since it identified particular bad actors outside the campaign and used the word “unwitting” to describe the contacts with the Trump campaign. But as the weekend went on, Mr. Trump’s longstanding frustrations with an inquiry that he has branded a “witch hunt” once again came to the fore. While the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, had noted repeatedly in announcing the indictment that it does not say that Russia changed the outcome of the election, Mr. Trump was angry because his own team had not gone further in his defense. That included General McMaster, who, as an active duty military officer, takes the constrictions on what he can say politically very seriously. When he spoke in Germany, Mr. McMaster did not believe he could go further than the cold facts of the document, a reality that deeply frustrated the president, two administration officials said. Although incensed by coverage of the Russia investigation, Mr. Trump spent part of the weekend focused on the school shooting. On Sunday, the White House announced that he would hold a “listening session” with high school students and teachers in Washington on Wednesday, and meet with state and local officials on school safety on Thursday. Mr. Trump also called three local officials, including Christine Hunschofsky, the mayor of Parkland. In an interview, Ms. Hunschofsky said she was struck by how affected the president had seemed by his hospital visit. “He gave his condolences, and then he talked quite a bit,” Ms. Hunschofsky said. “He said he had talked to somebody recovering in the hospital. I remember he kept saying, ‘How do you recover from that?’” Katie Rogers reported from West Palm Beach, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

Business,391," By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM and JOHN HERRMANMARCH 6, 2018 Conservatives are zeroing in on a new enemy in the political culture wars: Big Tech. Arguing that Silicon Valley is stifling their speech and suppressing right-wing content, publishers and provocateurs on the right are eyeing a public-relations battle against online giants like Google and Facebook, the same platforms they once relied on to build a national movement. In a sign of escalation, Peter Schweizer, a right-wing journalist known for his investigations into Hillary Clinton, plans to release a new film focusing on technology companies and their role in filtering the news. Tentatively titled “The Creepy Line,” Mr. Schweizer’s documentary is expected to have its first screening in May in Cannes, France — during the Cannes Film Festival, but not as part of the official competition. He used the same rollout two years ago for his previous film, an adaptation of his book “Clinton Cash” that he produced with Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News. “The Creepy Line” alludes to an infamous 2010 speech by Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google at the time, who dismissed concerns about privacy by declaring that his company’s policy was “to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it.”  The documentary, which has not been previously reported, dovetails with concerns raised in recent weeks by right-wing groups about censorship on digital media — a new front in a rapidly evolving culture war.  If the mainstream media is a perennial enemy of the right, Big Tech is a fresh and novel foe, arguably more relevant to 2018. Facebook, Google and their ilk are facing tough questions about their inability to police the content they distribute, including Russian propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign. The companies have also been accused by lawmakers, critics and activists of monopolistic tendencies and manipulative product design. The critique from conservatives, in contrast, casts the big tech companies as censorious and oppressive, all too eager to stifle right-wing content in an effort to mollify liberal critics. “This could end up being the free speech issue of our time,” said Alex Marlow, editor in chief of Breitbart News, which has published articles accusing Google and Facebook of, among other sins, political bias. “The Silicon Valley elites are saying: ‘We don’t care what you want to see — we know what you should see. We know better.’” Big Tech is easily associated with West Coast liberalism and Democratic politics, making it a fertile target for the right. And operational opacity at Facebook, Google and Twitter, which are reluctant to reveal details about their algorithms and internal policies, can leave them vulnerable, too. “It’s the perfect foil,” said Eli Pariser, a former executive director of the liberal activist group MoveOn.org and the author of “The Filter Bubble,” a book about how consumers find information online. “There’s not even a real basis to establish objective research about what’s happening on Facebook, because it’s closed.” Google, Facebook and Twitter loomed large at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., where dozens of guests squeezed into a standing-room-only ballroom for a discussion called “Suppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.” Among the panelists were James O’Keefe, the guerrilla filmmaker who has tried to undermine news outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN, and James Damore, an engineer fired by Google after he circulated a memo arguing that biological differences accounted for the low number of women in engineering.  Mr. Damore — a new celebrity in the right-wing world, who, in an interview, said of his first foray to CPAC, “There’s definitely a lot of people that want to take selfies” — described a culture of dogmatic liberalism at Google. “There are political activists in all of these companies that want to actively push a liberal agenda,” he said. “Why does it matter? Because these companies are so ubiquitous and powerful that they are controlling all the means of mass communication.” Before Mr. Damore spoke, organizers distributed baseball caps to guests emblazoned with an illustration of Twitter’s bird logo, upside-down and with its eyes crossed out. The panelists accused social media platforms of delisting their videos or stripping them of advertising. Such charges have long been staples of far-right online discourse, especially among YouTubers, but Mr. Schweizer’s project is poised to bring such arguments to a new — and potentially larger — audience. Mr. Schweizer, 53, was a speechwriting consultant to President George W. Bush. His reporting has been cited by The Times and “60 Minutes,” although he often uses a bombastic style akin to that of Breitbart News. He is also the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative nonprofit organization. He and Mr. Bannon founded it with funding from the family of Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund manager and donor to Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign. Mr. Schweizer declined to identify the film’s financial backers. A spokeswoman for the institute said it was not involved in the project.      In some ways, the complaints from the right about Big Tech mirror the grumblings of legacy news organizations, which have expressed concern that online algorithms wield too much power over how readers gain access to their content. Jeffrey A. Zucker, the president of CNN, derided Google and Facebook as “monopolies” and called for regulators to step in during a speech in Spain last month, saying the tech hegemony is “the biggest issue facing the growth of journalism in the years ahead.” And former President Barack Obama said at an off-the-record conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last month that he worried Americans were living in “entirely different realities” and that large tech companies like Facebook were “not just an invisible platform, they’re shaping our culture in powerful ways.” The contents of the speech were published by Reason magazine.  In the right’s more internet-savvy quarters, tech platforms have been a regular — and fruitful — subject of discussion since before the 2016 election. In May that year, Facebook was forced to respond to claims that the curators of its Trending Topics feature had suppressed conservative news sources, a controversy that called attention to Facebook’s editorial power. That charge of editorial bias was echoed last weekend by Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, who accused YouTube of planning to delete his organization’s account, a claim that was widely shared among conservatives. YouTube did delete some videos that accused teenage survivors of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting of being “crisis actors,” and it issued “strikes,” or warnings, to the accounts of Infowars and Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and Infowars contributor. (YouTube denied that it had plans to delete the Infowars account.) Facebook has also caught flak for adjusting  the algorithm for its News Feed to emphasize posts from “friends, family and groups” over content from public pages. The change was part of an effort by the company to answer criticism, but also to reinvigorate its oldest and most profitable product, which recently recorded a decline in American daily users for the first time in its history. The Facebook adjustment has affected virtually every media organization that is partly dependent on the platform for audiences, but it appears to have hit some harder than others. They include right-wing sites like Gateway Pundit and the millennial-focused Independent Journal Review, which was forced to lay off staff members last month. The social news giant BuzzFeed recently bought ads on Facebook with the message, “Facebook is taking the news out of your News Feed, but we’ve got you covered,” directing users to download its app. Away from the political scrum, the viral lifestyle site LittleThings, once a top publisher on the platform, announced last week that it would cease operations, blaming “a full-on catastrophic update” to Facebook’s revised algorithms. Right-wing media has pounced. In late February, citing statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip, Breitbart published an article on the effects on the president’s Facebook page with the headline “EXCLUSIVE: Trump’s Facebook Engagement Declined By 45 Percent Following Algorithm Change.” The drop, the article insinuated, occurred “following a year of pressure from left-wing employees and the mainstream media for ‘allowing’ the president to win the 2016 general election.” Still, the brewing backlash did not stop Google and Facebook from courting the very crowd that now seems ready to declare them enemies. Both companies were sponsors at this year’s CPAC, leading to a few awkward moments.  Facebook, which sponsored a “help desk” for attendees featuring smiling representatives and cookies frosted with emoji icons, provided a demonstration of its virtual reality program, Oculus. But the company was forced to apologize for including a first-person shooter simulation, given that the conference took place a week after the Parkland massacre. Google, which has co-sponsored CPAC three of the past six years, held a lavish reception for attendees featuring an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace. Mr. Marlow, the editor of Breitbart, was asked in an interview what he thought about Google’s giving a party in the midst of a crowd that is gunning for it. “The least they can do,” Mr. Marlow said, “is buy us a drink.” A version of this article appears in print on March 7, 2018, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Conservatives Find New Foil In Culture Wars: Silicon Valley.

SpecialSections,392," By ABBY ELLINAPRIL 5, 2018 The class was supposed to be temporary, a quick dive into the link between literature and anthropology. The professors had no idea if students would even come. It wasn’t mandatory, they wouldn’t get credit and it was taking place at night. Friday night. So no one was more surprised than Kara Wittman and Joanne Nucho when 24 people showed up for their “Essay as Resistance” class, which had its debut at Pomona College in March 2017 and ran for three 90-minute sessions. “We were shocked that it was so popular,” said Ms. Wittman, an assistant professor of English at Pomona, in Claremont, Calif., who taught the class with Ms. Nucho, an assistant professor of anthropology there. But that’s exactly the appeal of the so-called pop-up class, an experiential, interdisciplinary, extracurricular workshop that appears briefly and usually vanishes. Pop-up classes have grown in popularity over the last few years, with a number of colleges and universities offering them. They’re often related to current events. Bennington College’s “Am I Charlie?,” held in 2015, was a response to the attacks on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in France. “White Privilege” was offered last year at St. Michael’s College in Colchester, Vt., when Black Lives Matter gained traction on campus. “It was a time when our community on campus and nationally was divided around issues of race, and we wanted to give our students the opportunity to discuss some of these challenging topics,” said Kimoi Seale, assistant dean of students, who taught the “White Privilege” class.  Pop-ups have appeared in various incarnations for a while, but are often traced to Stanford University’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, commonly called the D.school, for seasoned instructors to try out new course content.  More recently, the D.school’s University Innovation Fellows program began to use pop-ups as tools for students to be more engaged in their own learning environments. The D.school’s pop-ups have since become “Pop Outs,” which have a narrower focus. Timothy Moore, 25, was a University Innovation fellow in 2015. After being introduced to the idea of pop-ups, he brought the concept back to James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., from which he graduated that year. The university’s X-Lab has since held pop-ups in everything from building ukuleles to ice-cream making using liquid nitrogen. Welcome to the new Learning section — a deep dive into the joys, excitement, challenges and opportunities in the world of education and learning. This is the first of four refreshed and redesigned sections we will publish this year. Drawing on the commitment to the subject and the expertise across The New York Times, we want Learning to be a place where educators, students and parents can join a vigorous conversation around the best ways to educate people, whether children or adults. (You can reach us at  learningsection@nytimes.com with comments and ideas.) - Jane Bornemeier, Editor “A lot of teachers don’t realize that the pop-up will make their curriculum stronger,” said Mr. Moore, who now works at Claremont College’s Hive, a program at the school that brings students together across disciplines to practice human-centered approached to real-world problems. “They’re a low-risk way to try out a class.” The beauty of the pop-up is that anything goes. Some classes last a few weeks; others run for a day or weekend. Some are faculty led; others are taught by students, administrators or even local businesspeople. Some are for credit; others are strictly for fun — or, at least, personal enlightenment. And sometimes the classes are so popular that they return as full-fledged, for-credit courses, which is what happened with the “Essay as Resistance” class. “Our goal here is to enhance the creative capacity of our students and teach them to navigate ambiguity, and to foster experimental learning,” said Fred Leichter, founding director of the Hive, officially the Rick and Susan Sontag Center for Collaborative Creativity. “The pop-ups are designed as a way to offer things that are often mash-ups between different disciplines. To me it’s one of the purest forms of learning. Both parties are there to create something together.” Here is a look at some pop-ups at schools around country. When fires ravaged Southern California last summer and major flooding followed soon after, Char Miller took notice. Mr. Miller, director of environmental analysis at Pomona College, has been teaching about fire for over two decades. “But the particular dynamic between fires and flood, which was so horrifying this winter — we have this incredible opportunity to show students on the ground what that actually means,” he said. “It’s a way for students to understand that they live in a particular place and that the natural systems here function differently than from wherever they come.” To be taught this fall by Mr. Miller and Jeff Groves, an English professor at Harvey Mudd College. Last year, Margaret Hagan, director of the Legal Design Lab at Stanford and a lecturer at the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, taught “Design for Justice: Traffic,” which focused on navigating the traffic court system.  The next subject, in a class running this month and next: eviction. “Most of the people who get evicted don’t take any steps to fight their notices in court. That means there’s more eviction notices because it’s easier for landlords to use the court system without opposition,” she said. “If we can inform people of their rights in responding to an eviction notice, we might get more protection to them. To use the process. So the class is a lab — where my students, legal aid and the court — help them think through what interventions they can send out to encourage people to take action.” Antonia Messuri, the assistant dean for academics at St. Michael’s in Colchester, Vt., regularly counsels students who are stuck in their lives. “Often our students are coming from a place of being told what to do, how to do it and when it’s due their whole lives,” she said. This class, which runs through April, “is an opportunity for them to say, ‘This is my life, my education.’ ” Students will read articles on self-determination and Buddhist writings, with a focus on meditation, resilience and grit. The bulk of the pop-ups at James Madison are designed to be a mix of science and technology. In this class, on April 20, students learn the basic rules for safe flying, practice flight controls and then test their skills by flying through something they can relate to: a Quidditch course. “It’s designed to expose them to lightweight drones and the opportunity to take the full drone class where they learn how to use drones to solve real-world problems,” said Nick Swayne, founding director of the university’s X-Lab. “We will also have small model rockets available for students to try. These rockets are used extensively by our geology department to increase student interest in atmospheric studies.” Since the spring of 2015, Bennington College in Bennington, Vt., has been offering pop-up courses. In this course, taught by State Senator Brian Campion, who is also the director of public policy programs in the Center for the Advancement of Public Action, students will explore gun culture, gun policy, the continuing work of policymakers at the state’s Capitol, and whether or not such actions are likely to be the most effective to keep citizens safe. The course, which runs through April, will bring in guests with different perspectives. An earlier version of this article misspelled the city in which James Madison University is located. It is Harrisonburg, Va., not Harrisburg. A version of this article appears in print on April 8, 2018, on Page F6 of the New York edition with the headline: Pop-Up Classes On Hot Topics.

NYTNow,393," By KAREN ZRAICK and DAVID SCULLAPRIL 4, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. It looks a lot like a trade war. Hours after the White House outlined $50 billion in tariffs on largely high-tech Chinese products, China announced its own tariffs on $50 billion worth of American goods. China’s list focused on agricultural products that come from the Republican-dominated farm belt, where lawmakers might be expected to have some influence with President Trump. Above, harvesting soybeans in Illinois. Administration officials say they see no reason to panic, and markets rose after an erratic day. ____ 2. The White House said that the U.S. would remain in Syria to continue the fight against the Islamic State — just a day after President Trump said “it’s time” to bring the 2,000 U.S. troops there home.  Mr. Trump’s own national security team is in flux, and Pentagon officials argued strenuously against a pullout. They pointed to the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq after President Obama withdrew — a precedent they said laid the groundwork for the militant organization to flourish.  ____ 3. President Trump will sign a proclamation directing federal officials to work with governors to deploy National Guard troops to the southwest border. That decision started earlier this week with a Fox News report about a caravan of Central American migrants moving north through Mexico, above. On today’s episode of “The Daily,” we look at how Mr. Trump’s approach to immigration transformed over 72 hours. ____ 4. Facebook said that the data of up to 87 million users may have been improperly shared with a political consulting firm connected to President Trump’s 2016 campaign. That figure is far higher than a previously reported estimate. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, above, will testify before Congress next week on its handling of sensitive user data. And at Google, thousands of employees signed a letter protesting the company’s role in a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence to interpret videos and could be used in drone strikes. ____ 5. Anger that YouTube was blocking her videos may have motivated the woman who shot three people on Tuesday at the company’s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif., and then killed herself with the same handgun. Nasim Najafi Aghdam, above, who was in her late 30s and living in California, was a social media star in Iran. Known there as “Green Nasim,” she posted music parodies and workouts, promoted vegan cooking and opposed animal cruelty. (We gathered some of her clips in this video, which our Tehran bureau chief narrates.)  Some of her videos were apparently “demonetized” — deliberately starved of ads — by YouTube, which has been under pressure over offensive content. ____ 6. “It has to be perfect.”  We sat in as students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., above, put together their yearbook — and grappled with how to tell the story of the mass shooting that took the lives of 17 people. And the Patriots star Julian Edelman may have thwarted a school shooting by reporting a threat, left by a 14-year-old, in a comment on one of Edelman’s Instagram posts. ____ 7. Thousands of people gathered in Memphis to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In a Times Op-Ed, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, once an aide to Dr. King, reflects on his legacy: “We owe it to Dr. King — and to our children and grandchildren — to commemorate the man in full: a radical, ecumenical, antiwar, pro-immigrant and scholarly champion of the poor who spent much more time marching and going to jail for liberation and justice than he ever spent dreaming about it.” For complete coverage of the 50th anniversary of Dr. King’s assassination, including original essays and photos from our archive, click here. ____ 8. Global warming is causing spring to arrive early and autumn to come late in many places, and not all plants and animals are adapting at the same rate. Scientists who study the changes in plants and animals triggered by seasons have a term for this: phenological mismatch. And they’re still trying to understand exactly how it works and what the consequences might be.  Here are five mismatches they’ve discovered so far, including one that means the calves of caribou in western Greenland, above, are dying at higher rates. ____ 9. There’s a new niche in the $100 billion tutoring industry: homework therapists. They mix the roles of traditional tutor and straight-up therapist, in person or online. Some New York City parents are doling out hundreds of dollars for the academic help and emotional support for their children. Meanwhile, thousands of teachers in multiple states are striking to protest cuts in pay and benefits and school funding. Inspired by circulating photos of crumbling textbooks in Oklahoma schools, our Reader Center is asking public school teachers about conditions in their classrooms. ____ 10. Finally, what’s on TV? Reboots. “Trading Spaces” returns Saturday on TLC after a decade-long hiatus, and “Jersey Shore Family Vacation” begins Thursday on MTV. “These shows return with casts largely intact, and conceit and ideology trapped in amber, too,” our critic writes. “But both of them are also experiments to see whether the structures of a more naïve time can hold up when filled with a more self-aware participant.” Speaking of self-awareness, the late-night hosts took aim at President Trump’s broadsides against Amazon. “This is when I appreciate Twitter,” Seth Meyers said. “It used to be, if you wanted to hear a 71-year-old man whining about the post office, you had to go to the post office.” Have a great night. ____ Get a nightly rundown of the day’s top stories, delivered to your inbox every Monday through Friday.

National,394," By JACEY FORTIN and MITCH SMITHMARCH 3, 2018 A day after two people were shot and killed in a dorm room at Central Michigan University on Friday, the police charged the victims’ son, a sophomore at the school, with murder. The son, James E. Davis Jr., 19, had been acting strangely the day before the shooting, Chief Bill Yeagley of the Central Michigan University Police Department said at a news conference on Saturday. He said the gun recovered at the scene was registered to Mr. Davis’s slain father, James E. Davis Sr., a police officer. On Saturday afternoon, the university police said in a statement that Mr. Davis was in police custody at a hospital. He was charged with two counts of murder and one count of possession of a weapon to commit murder.  Mr. Davis “had no interaction that we’re aware of in any negative fashion with anybody prior to this incident,” Chief Yeagley said.  On Thursday, the student approached campus officers, apparently concerned that he was in danger. “He said someone was out to hurt him, someone was going to harm him,” Chief Yeagley said, adding that Mr. Davis referred to someone who had a gun, but made statements that were “very vague” and did not seem to make sense. After looking into the issue and questioning another student, officers determined there was no threat to Mr. Davis and asked how they could help, Chief Yeagley said. Spring break was just around the corner. “He said, ‘I’m fine. I’m going home in the morning, so I’ll be good,’” Chief Yeagley said. 
            The suspect is still at large. James Eric Davis, Jr, is a black male, approximately 19 years of age, 5'10"" and 135 lbs.The suspect is considered armed and dangerous. If you see him, do not approach the suspect. Call 911 immediately. pic.twitter.com/uqD6CkIe5y         But a few hours later, officers encountered Mr. Davis with a number of suitcases and bags in a dorm hallway and again he was speaking nonsensically, the chief said. The police statement said Mr. Davis made “statements that he was under the influence of drugs.” An officer spoke on the phone with Mr. Davis’s mother, Diva J. Davis, who said she and her husband would come to the university. Officers helped Mr. Davis check into a hospital on Thursday night. His parents picked him up there on Friday and returned to the campus. Chief Yeagley said Mr. Davis appeared to have been making trips back and forth to his parents’ car to load his belongings on Friday morning when, according to an eyewitness and some video footage, Mr. Davis brought a gun from the parking lot to his fourth-floor dorm room, where the shooting occurred. The shooting set off a search for Mr. Davis that included more than 100 police officers, from several Michigan agencies and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.  Chief Yeagley said Mr. Davis was found disoriented and with possible hypothermia shortly before 1 a.m. on Saturday, near railroad tracks in Mount Pleasant, Mich., about 155 miles northwest of Detroit. 
            The shooting at Central Michigan University today strikes close to home. A sad day in Bellwood and across the 7th District. My sincerest condolences go out to the family of Bellwood Police Officer James Davis Sr. and his wife who were shot and killed this morning. May they RIP. pic.twitter.com/B0cykAxFVv         News of the deaths hit hard in the Chicago suburb of Bellwood, Ill., where Officer Davis had worked for almost 20 years as a part-time police officer. “He was loved by all here,” said Mayor Andre F. Harvey, who recalled playing with Officer Davis decades ago in Bellwood, when they were both children. Chief Jiminez Allen of the Bellwood police said his department was taking the loss “very hard, including myself.”      “Our officers really took it to heart,” Mr. Harvey said. “There was some crying. There was a lot of hugging.” American Airlines on Saturday confirmed that Ms. Davis worked for the company as a flight attendant. “This is an extraordinarily difficult time for those who knew and loved Diva, and our hearts go out to her family and friends,” Martha Thomas, a spokeswoman for the airline, said in a phone interview on Saturday. Coming about two weeks after a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., the shooting on Friday rattled nerves at Central Michigan. Details were released slowly, and students were told to take shelter inside dorms and classrooms for hours. With Mr. Davis in custody, “the danger that our community has experienced over the last 24 hours or so is now over,” Chief Yeagley said on Saturday.  ",2018-03-03,0.0016293735,Saturday
Opinion,395," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By John Quiggin The Pew Research Center announced last week that it will define people born between 1981 and 1996 as members of the millennial generation, embracing a slightly narrower range of years than the ones used by the United States Census Bureau. It would have been better, though, if it had announced the end of what I call the “generation game” — the insistence on dividing society into groups based on birth year and imputing different characteristics to each group. Yes, limited insights can be gleaned from thinking of humans in terms of generations, but this ultimately does more harm than good by obscuring the individual factors that actually shape our attitudes, politics and opportunities. To see what’s wrong with the idea, take a look at American millennials. In seemingly endless essays in recent years, they’ve been derided as lazy and narcissistic or defended as creative and committed to social change. But these all sound like characteristics that the old have ascribed to the young since the dawn of time. Similar terms were applied to the “slacker” Generation X and before that, the baby boomers. It’s true that the current cohort (the demographic term for a group of people born around the same time) of young people is different in important ways from earlier cohorts. It’s more ethnically diverse, with a smaller proportion of whites and more of most other racial and ethnic groups. But diversity is a characteristic of a population, not, in most cases, of individuals. A relatively small proportion of millennials personally embody ethnic diversity in the sense of identifying with more than one race or ethnicity. Much of the apparent distinctiveness of the millennial generation disappears when we look at individuals rather than aggregates. Black millennials, like their parents, overwhelmingly vote Democratic. By contrast, 41 percent of white millennials voted for Donald Trump in 2016. That’s lower than the 58 percent of all white voters who went for Mr. Trump, but it makes more sense to attribute the difference to individual characteristics and experiences rather than a generational attitude. Compared to the population as a whole, a larger proportion of millennials are college-educated, and a smaller proportion live in rural areas. Like other urban and educated voters, urban and educated millennials tend to vote Democratic. Rural millennials, meanwhile, share many of the attitudes of older rural voters who voted for Mr. Trump. Activism by high school students in response to the Parkland, Fla., shooting has inspired interest in the generation younger than millennials, known as “Gen Z” or “iGen.” A recent Washington Post essay declared: “Millennials disrupted the system. Gen Z is here to fix the mess.” It argued that members of this cohort “value compromise” as “a byproduct of their diversity and comfort with working with peers from different backgrounds.” But given that public schools have been resegregating for decades, to assume that the demographic makeup of a generation would have a meaningful impact on most individual Gen Z members’ experiences with diversity seems misguided. Although much of its current popularity can be traced to the influential 1991 book “Generations” by Neil Howe and William Strauss, generational thinking dates back to the second half of the 19th century.  Sarah Laskow of The Atlantic  explained in 2014 that philosophers at this time were, in the words of the sociologist Karl Mannheim, “anxious to find a general law to express the rhythm of historical development, based on the biological law of the limited lifetimes of man.” /But understanding societal phenomena through the lens of groups of people born around the same time has always had its limits. For example, it’s true that for young men coming-of-age during the Vietnam War, being born in a particular year (and, thanks to the draft lottery, on a particular day) could be life-shaping. But even here, an individual’s class was a factor in whether he actually went to war — men from privileged backgrounds had many options to avoid the draft, the burden of which fell mainly on the working class. Like war service, entering the labor market at a time of recession, as most millennials did, can be difficult. But race and class are more important in affecting how this experience plays out for individuals. Take white millennial college graduates: Yes, they’re part of an age cohort that has experienced worse economic conditions than graduates of the preceding generation — but that doesn’t give us a particularly meaningful understanding of their plight, given that they are still better off when it comes to income than the average non-college-educated worker of any age. Some may argue that the generation game, if intellectually vacuous, is basically harmless. But dividing society by generation obscures the real and enduring lines of race, class and gender. When, for example, baby boomers are blamed for “ruining America,” the argument lumps together Donald Trump and a 60-year-old black woman who works for minimum wage cleaning one of his hotels. The pattern of inherited privilege points to yet another reality that the generation game ignores: the decline of social mobility between generations and the rise of what the French economist Thomas Piketty has called a “patrimonial society.” When it comes to wealth and its accompanying privileges, the wealth of the previous generation of one’s own family matter more than whether your birth year falls on one or other side of some arbitrary boundary. Today’s young people may choose political action aimed at reversing these trends or to let them continue and accelerate. But their choices will be determined by their political judgments and personal commitments, not by a number on a birth certificate.

Washington,396," By ERICA L. GREENAPRIL 4, 2018 WASHINGTON — Black students continue to be disciplined at school more often and more harshly than their white peers, often for similar infractions, according to a new report by Congress’s nonpartisan watchdog agency, which counters claims fueling the Trump administration’s efforts to re-examine discipline policies of the Obama administration. The report, issued by the Government Accountability Office on Wednesday, is the first national governmental analysis of discipline policies since the Obama administration issued guidance in 2014 that urged schools to examine the disproportionate rates at which black students were being punished. Critics of the Obama-era guidance have questioned whether students of color suffer from unfair treatment under school discipline policies. The G.A.O. found that not only have black students across the nation continued to bear the brunt of such policies, but the effects were also felt more widely than previously reported — including by black students in affluent schools. Additionally, the agency found that school suspensions began to fall the year before the Obama administration urged schools to move away from the overuse of such measures, undermining claims that the guidance forced schools to cut suspensions. While the Obama administration’s aggressive civil rights investigations did reveal that black students were subjected to harsher treatment than their white peers for similar infractions, the G.A.O. found that it did not impose any new mandates on districts to reduce their suspension rates.  The findings are likely to bolster arguments for preserving the 2014 guidance and undercut conservative claims that the guidance has resulted in federal overreach and a decline in school safety.  On Wednesday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos hosted groups of educators and advocates for and against the disciplinary guidance, the 12th set of round tables the department has held in the past year — and the first Ms. DeVos attended in person. Nina Leuzzi, a prekindergarten teacher at a Boston charter school, said she kept her word to her class of 20, predominantly minority 4-year-olds, in making her case to the secretary for why the guidance should stay. When the children asked her why she was traveling to Washington, she told them it was to keep them safe. “Rescinding this would send the message that there is no longer a concern about discrimination in our schools,” Ms. Leuzzi said. Nicole Stewart, a former vice principal in San Diego, told Ms. DeVos that pressures to reduce suspensions had made schools dangerous. She said administrators did not expel a student with a knife at her school because he had a disability. Weeks later, he slit a student’s throat, she said. “It is no wonder that our kids don’t think that rules and consequences apply to them,” Ms. Stewart said. “We are not modeling what consequences look like in the real world.” Ms. DeVos is facing new pressures after Republicans linked the guidance to the February mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and President Trump assigned her to lead a school safety commission that will consider whether to repeal the guidance. Ms. DeVos has declined to say publicly whether she believes that racial bias plays a role in the disproportionate rates at which black students are punished in school. But according to attendees at Wednesday’s meeting, the secretary opened her remarks by acknowledging that the conversations were taking place on the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination, and that racial disparities in discipline were a problem in the country.  Evan Stone, co-founder of Educators for Excellence, which represents nearly 30,000 educators across the country, said the acknowledgment gave him hope. “Still, we have a real uphill battle ahead,” said Mr. Stone, who attended the meeting with Ms. Leuzzi and five other teachers who are part of the group. Members of Congress urged Ms. DeVos not to make a decision on the guidance until the G.A.O. report was made public. The Education Department did not issue a response to the G.A.O. findings, as is customary, and did not respond to a request for comment on the report. The Obama administration guidance was issued based on data that showed that, in 2012, black students were being suspended at three times the rate of their white peers. According to the G.A.O. analysis, in the 2013-14 school year, black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school. The agency also found the disparities for black students started in preschool, and persisted regardless of the type of school they attended — disparities were particularly acute in charter schools — or the disciplinary action they received. And black students were the only race in which both boys and girls were disproportionately disciplined across six disciplinary actions examined, which included corporal punishment, in- and out-of-school suspensions, expulsions and school-related arrests. Moreover, the agency found that black students were suspended more often than their white peers in schools of all poverty levels. In the most affluent schools, 7.5 percent of black boys had been given out-of-school suspensions, while 1.8 percent of white boys had. The finding marks the first time that national discipline rates have been analyzed by poverty level, and challenges a common claim that poverty, more than race, may be driving disproportionate rates of disciplinary actions. Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles’s Civil Rights Project, called the finding “groundbreaking.” He said it affirms other research that shows that even black boys raised in rich neighborhoods were likely to earn less than their white peers. Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.     “This further shows that poverty is not explaining the disparities,” Mr. Losen said. “There’s a racial discrimination problem, and that can no longer be disputed.”  The G.A.O. analysis was requested by Representative Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia, and Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York. The agency was charged with identifying patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, the challenges that school districts faced with discipline reform, and how the Departments of Education and Justice have addressed the issue through enforcement measures. The investigation took place from November 2016 through March, and included data analysis and interviews with officials in the Education and Justice Departments, as well as district leaders in five states. The report was praised by Democratic lawmakers as evidence that the 2014 guidance had value. The guidance informed schools that wide racial disparities could signal discriminatory practices that could result in a federal investigation and loss of federal funding. It also suggested a number of strategies for managing nonviolent behavior without resorting to kicking students out of school. “The G.A.O.’s first-of-its-kind analysis confirms that racial bias contributes to pervasive discipline disparities,” Mr. Scott and Mr. Nadler said in a joint statement. “The G.A.O.’s findings underscore the need to strengthen the guidance, not rescind it as some have recommended.” But critics who want to see the Obama-era guidance rescinded said the report’s scope was too narrow to draw broad conclusions. “None of these findings change the basic story line,” said Michael J. Petrilli, the president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a research organization. “What we’ve learned is discipline reform is being applied unevenly. If you are concerned there are some specific districts and schools that are responding particularly poorly to this, I don’t think this study gets at that question.” Mr. Petrilli also said the report did not answer the question at the heart of the Obama-guidance criticism: whether racial bias accounted for all the disparities.  The G.A.O. examination illustrated how racial bias was unfolding in some districts. For instance, at a school district in Kentucky where black students were 10 times as likely as white students to be disciplined, school officials acknowledged that 61 types of violations were undefined, which allowed staff to punish black students more harshly. In interviews, district officials also reported that they maintained broad discretion in how they disciplined students, and that more serious offenses, like those concerning weapons, violence and drugs, still resulted in removing students from school. And all of the school districts reported that while they embraced the opportunity to revise their approach to discipline, their biggest barrier was not student behavior. It was the lack of resources to tackle cases of trauma and mental health issues that increasingly plague the nation’s children.

Washington,397," By JEREMY W. PETERSAPRIL 4, 2018 WASHINGTON — It was the kind of story destined to take a dark turn through the conservative news media and grab President Trump’s attention: A vast horde of migrants was making its way through Mexico toward the United States, and no one was stopping them. “Mysterious group deploys ‘caravan’ of illegal aliens headed for U.S. border,” warned Frontpage Mag, a site run by David Horowitz, a conservative commentator. The Gateway Pundit, a website that was most recently in the news for spreading conspiracies about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., suggested the real reason the migrants were trying to enter the United States was to collect social welfare benefits. And as the president often does when immigration is at issue, he saw a reason for Americans to be afraid. “Getting more dangerous. ‘Caravans’ coming,” a Twitter post from Mr. Trump read.  The story of “the caravan” followed an arc similar to many events — whether real, embellished or entirely imagined — involving refugees and migrants that have roused intense suspicion and outrage on the right. The coverage tends to play on the fears that hiding among mass groups of immigrants are many criminals, vectors of disease and agents of terror. And often the president, who announced his candidacy by blaming Mexico for sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States, acts as an accelerant to the hysteria.  The sensationalization of this story and others like it seems to serve a common purpose for Mr. Trump and other immigration hard-liners: to highlight the twin dangers of freely roving migrants — especially those from Muslim countries — and lax immigration laws that grant them easy entry into Western nations. The narrative on the right this week, for example, mostly omitted that many people in the caravan planned to resettle in Mexico, not the United States. And it ignored how many of those who did intend to come here would probably go through the legal process of requesting asylum at a border checkpoint — something miles of new wall and battalions of additional border patrol would not have stopped. “They end up in schools on Long Island, some of which are MS-13!” declared Brian Kilmeade on the president’s preferred morning news program, “Fox & Friends,” referring to the predominantly Central American gang. The coverage became so distorted that it prompted a reporter for Breitbart News who covers border migration, Brandon Darby, to push back. “I’m seeing a lot of right media cover this as ‘people coming illegally’ or as ‘illegal aliens.’ That is incorrect,” he wrote on Twitter. “They are coming to a port of entry and requesting refugee status. That is legal.” In an interview, Mr. Darby said it was regrettable that the relatively routine occurrence of migrant caravans — which organizers rely on as a safety-in-numbers precaution against the violence that can happen along the trek — was being politicized. “The caravan isn’t something that’s a unique event,” he said. “And I think people are looking at it wrong. If you’re upset at the situation, it’s easier to be mad at the migrant than it is to be mad at the political leaders on both sides who won’t change the laws.” As tends to be the case in these stories, the humanitarian aspects get glossed over as migrants are collapsed into one maligned category: hostile foreign invaders. In November, Mr. Trump touched off an international furor when he posted a series of videos on Twitter that purported to show the effects of mass Muslim migration in Europe. Initially circulated by a fringe ultranationalist in Britain who has railed against Islam, the videos included titles like “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!” “Muslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!” and “Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!”  The assailant in one video the president shared, however, was not a “Muslim migrant.” And the other two videos depicted four-year-old events with no explanation. These items tend to metastasize irrespective of the facts, but contain powerful visual elements to which Mr. Trump is known to viscerally respond. Last February, Mr. Trump  insinuated that some kind of terror-related episode involving Muslim immigrants had taken place in Sweden. “Who would believe this? Sweden,” he said at a rally in Florida, leaving Swedes and Americans baffled because nothing out of the ordinary had happened at all. “They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible.” Like the caravan story, which apparently came to Mr. Trump’s attention as he watched “Fox & Friends,” the president was referring to something he had seen on cable news. And he later had to clarify that he was referring to a Fox News segment on issues Sweden was having with migrants generally, not any particular event. Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.     The conservative National Review later called the piece in question “sensationalistic” and pointed out that a lack of government data made it virtually impossible to determine whether crime rates in the country were related to immigration. When the president himself has not spread stories about immigration that were either misleading or turned out to be false, his White House aides have. Last year, the White House joined a pile-on by the conservative news media after it called attention to the account of a high school student in Montgomery County, Md., who said she was raped at school by two classmates, one of whom is an undocumented immigrant. The case became a national rallying cry on the right against permissive border policies and so-called sanctuary cities that treat undocumented immigrants more leniently. Fox News broadcast live outside the high school for days. Prosecutors later dropped the charges after they said the evidence did not substantiate the girl’s claims. The story of the caravan has been similarly exaggerated. And the emotional outpouring from the right has been raw — that was the case on Fox this week when the TV host Tucker Carlson shouted “You hate America!” at an immigrants rights activist after he defended the people marching through Mexico.  The facts of the caravan are not as straightforward as Mr. Trump or many conservative pundits have portrayed them. The story initially gained widespread attention after BuzzFeed News reported last week that more than 1,000 Central American migrants, mostly from Honduras, were making their way north toward the United States border. Yet the BuzzFeed article and other coverage pointed out that many in the group were planning to stay in Mexico. That did not stop Mr. Trump from expressing dismay on Tuesday with a situation “where you have thousands of people that decide to just walk into our country, and we don’t have any laws that can protect it.” The use of disinformation in immigration debates is hardly unique to the United States. Misleading crime statistics, speculation about sinister plots to undermine national sovereignty and Russian propaganda have all played a role in stirring up anti-immigrant sentiment in places like Britain, Germany and Hungary. Some of the more fantastical theories have involved a socialist conspiracy to import left-leaning voters and a scheme by the Hungarian-born Jewish philanthropist George Soros to create a borderless Europe. Anyone watching Fox News this week would have heard about similar forces at work inside “the caravan.” “This was an organized plan and deliberate attack on the sovereignty of the United States by a special interest group,” said David Ward, whom the network identified as a former agent for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “They rallied a bunch of foreign nationals to come north into the United States to test our resolve.” A version of this article appears in print on April 5, 2018, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: How the ‘Caravan’ Story  Exploded on the Right.

NYTNow,398," By CHRIS STANFORDFEB. 16, 2018  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “Deadly shootings in schools — that is, the killing of children in sanctuaries of learning — have become a distinctly American ritual,” our columnist writes, “the rote responses as familiar as a kindergarten recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.” Our live briefing has the latest on the aftermath of Wednesday’s attack at a high school in Parkland, Fla., which killed 17 people. Here’s what we know about the victims. At a vigil on Thursday, a woman said of her daughter, “I hope she didn’t die for nothing.” The suspect, Nikolas Cruz, 19, has confessed to the shootings. Neighbors and classmates described him as emotionally troubled, although he had no criminal history.  • Survivors  implored Congress on Thursday to act. Lawmakers failed to do so after similar shootings last year in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Tex. • The Senate blocked three measures to resolve the fate of hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants on Thursday.  Two bipartisan bills were defeated, as was the hard-line legislation favored by President Trump. • Protections for the Dreamers begin to expire March 5, but what happens next is unclear. “I think it’s safe to say this has been a disappointing week,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, said. • President Trump’s inaugural committee spent heavily on administration and logistics and donated less to charity than expected, tax filings released on Thursday showed. The biggest payment from the record $107 million raised was to an event-planning firm founded six weeks before the inauguration by a longtime friend of Melania Trump’s. • The committee gave $5 million to charity, which inaugural officials pointed out was more than Barack Obama’s committee donated. • Mikaela Shiffrin, who said she was vomiting minutes before starting, came fourth in the slalom today. She won gold in the event four years ago. The figure skater Nathan Chen also had a poor performance, in the short program. A norovirus outbreak at the Games has affected hundreds of people. Two Swiss athletes were confirmed today as the first competitors to contract the illness.  • Here are today’s Olympic results. Find all our coverage here. • Saturday is the 10th anniversary of the nation’s independence, after a campaign of ethnic cleansing by the forces of Slobodan Milosevic’s Serbia. Our correspondent, who covered the war as a photographer nearly 20 years ago, returned to find that people had little to celebrate. • “If it wasn’t for all those who have laid down their lives for this, I would say let’s go back to the way it was before,” one man said. The AR-15 assault rifle used in Parkland, Fla., this week was purchased legally, officials said. How did a weapon designed for warfare become easier to buy than a handgun? • A Chinese-owned company will not be taking over the Chicago Stock Exchange. A federal regulator  blocked the $20 million proposal on Thursday. • Children’s publishing is having its #MeToo moment. Several best-selling authors, including the creator of “The Maze Runner” series, have been accused this week of inappropriate sexual behavior. • He turned Taco Bell around. Can Brian Niccol do it again when he becomes Chipotle’s chief executive next month? • U.S. stocks were up on Thursday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today. Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. •  Four free apps to help you earn extra cash. • Ordering room service without disappointment. • Recipe of the day: Celebrate the Lunar New Year with longevity noodles.  • Partisan writing you shouldn’t miss Writers from across the political spectrum discuss gun control. • Abuse inquiry ends in a cloud A two-month investigation didn’t corroborate allegations of sexual harassment or physical abuse against Peter Martins, the former chief of New York City Ballet. But the company and its school announced new policies to assure that dancers “feel safe, respected and able to voice their opinions and concerns freely.” • The week in good news It isn’t all bad out there. • Quiz time! Did you keep up with this week’s news? Test yourself. • Ready for the weekend You already know. “Black Panther” is expected to take in at least $250 million worldwide in the next few days, which would deal a blow to the Hollywood belief that movies rooted in black culture aren’t blockbuster material. Here’s our review. Our critic also likes the animated “Early Man,” by the makers of Wallace and Gromit. We have TV suggestions based on how much time you have and review Chris Rock’s first comedy special in a decade, on Netflix. We recommend 11 new books and revisit Alistair MacLean, the author of what our columnist calls “romance novels for boys.” Finally, “Outliers and American Vanguard Art,” at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, highlights outstanding, sometimes rarely seen artworks. It’s an NYT Critic’s Pick. Get a nightly rundown of the day’s top stories, delivered to your inbox every Monday through Friday.     • Best of late-night TV Several comedy hosts are taking the week off, so our roundup is, too. It will return next week.  • Quotation of the day “If they’re not able to purchase their first drink of alcohol, then how are we allowed to buy guns at the age of 18 or 19? Obviously whatever we have going on, it’s not working.” — Lyliah Skinner, a survivor of the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. • The Times, in other words Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. Today marks the start of the Year of the Dog, the latest turn in the 12-year lunar zodiac cycle. The phrase “Lunar New Year” is sometimes used interchangeably with “Chinese New Year,” but there are variations in how the holiday is celebrated around Asia. In Vietnam, it’s an occasion for a type of rice cake called banh chung, deeply intertwined with nationalist myths and ancestor-worship customs. Vietnam’s zodiac cycle differs slightly from China’s: It has a cat and a water buffalo instead of a rabbit and an ox. Some historians say that’s a linguistic quirk tied to China’s 1,000-year imperial occupation of Vietnam, its southern neighbor. The Year of the Cat next falls in 2023. The last time the cat came around, in 2011, the owner of a “pet hotel” in the capital, Hanoi, told Reuters that the cat was an appropriate cosmic choice because it offsets the dog, its natural enemy. “This expresses a balance of yin and yang in the cosmos that is more complete, that better unifies the contradictions, and so it is richer and better to have the cat,” he said.

Business,399," By DAISUKE WAKABAYASHI, MAGGIE ASTOR, MAYA SALAM and MATT STEVENSAPRIL 3, 2018 Four people were injured in an attack by a woman at the YouTube headquarters on Tuesday, the police in San Bruno, Calif., said. SAN BRUNO, Calif. — A woman opened fire with a handgun at YouTube’s headquarters in California on Tuesday afternoon, shooting three people — one of whom was critically injured — before killing herself, the authorities said. The San Bruno Police Department identified the attacker late Tuesday as Nasim Najafi Aghdam, who was in her late 30s. The motivation for the shootings was under investigation, the police said, although her social media postings included criticisms of YouTube. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital received three patients: a man, 36, in critical condition; a woman, 32, in serious condition; and a woman, 27, in fair condition, a hospital spokesman, Brent Andrew, said at a news conference. A fourth person had injuries that weren’t from a gunshot, the police said. “At this time there is no evidence that the shooter knew the victims of this shooting or that individuals were specifically targeted,” the San Bruno Police Department said in a written statement.  Word of the attack in San Bruno at YouTube, which is owned by Google and is one of the world’s largest social media companies, quickly spread online through employees’ social media feeds.  Vadim Lavrusik, a YouTube employee who formerly worked for The New York Times, tweeted just before 1 p.m. that there was an “active shooter at YouTube HQ” and that he had “heard shots and saw people running while at my desk.” He was barricaded in a room with co-workers, he said, but moments later tweeted that he had been safely evacuated. The last known address for Ms. Aghdam was in Menifee, a city in Southern California about halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego. Ms. Aghdam was active on various social media outlets, including YouTube, where she had a number of channels in Persian, Turkish and English. On YouTube, she published an eclectic set of videos, including music parodies and workouts, on topics like animal cruelty and vegan cooking. In February 2017, she recorded a video on Facebook criticizing YouTube for taking measures that decreased the number of views on her videos. She said that she had contacted YouTube, but that the site’s support staff told her that her workout videos contained inappropriate scenes and needed to be restricted from younger audiences. “This is what they are doing to vegan activists and many other people who try to promote healthy, humane and smart living — people like me are not good for big business, like for animal business, medicine business and for many other businesses. That’s why they are discriminating and censoring us,” she said in the video on Facebook. YouTube had pulled down all of her channels as of Tuesday night. A 2009 story by The San Diego Union-Tribune quoted a woman with the same name as Ms. Aghdam at an animal rights protest outside Camp Pendleton, the Marine Corps base in Southern California. Two dozen attended the protest organized by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals against the use of pigs in military trauma training.  “For me, animal rights equal human rights,” said Ms. Aghdam, then 29, who attended the protest carrying a plastic sword and wearing a wig and jeans painted with drops of blood. The shootings on Tuesday took place in a courtyard at YouTube’s offices, the police said. Those offices, like other Google facilities, maintain light security, with employees using badges to go through security gates or doors. Usually, the main lobby is attended by a receptionist. There are no visible metal detectors or armed guards. San Bruno is about nine miles south of San Francisco, with a population around 43,000. YouTube is the city’s biggest employer, and many workers commute here from San Francisco. Though YouTube is owned by Google, it operates in a separate office, about 20 miles from Google’s main campus in Mountain View, Calif. Outside the YouTube headquarters, armed police officers waded into a crowd of 200 or so employees who had evacuated to a nearby parking lot Tuesday afternoon. The police asked for employees who had witnessed something firsthand to come forward, and about two dozen, some visibly distraught, walked over to the officers. Many employees said they had initially thought the episode was a fire drill. Others said they had run when people started shouting that there was a shooter. Two hours after the attack, YouTube employees, including Susan Wojcicki, the chief executive, continued to stream slowly down the hill, away from the office. Footage broadcast by CNN showed people leaving the building in single file with their hands raised above their heads. Separate footage showed a large crowd lining up to be frisked, one by one, by the police.      Zach Vorhies, 37, a senior software engineer at YouTube, said in an interview that he had been sitting at his desk when the fire alarm went off. He grabbed his electric skateboard and headed for a back exit, he said. As he rode down a gravel hill, he heard someone shouting and saw a man lying motionless in one of the office’s outdoor dining areas. “He had a red spot on his stomach, and he was lying on his back, not moving,” Mr. Vorhies said. “I saw the blood soak through the shirt.” About 25 feet away from the victim, he said, a man was shouting, “Come at me!” Mr. Vorhies thought the man was the attacker, but he did not see a gun and said it was possible that the man had actually “been taunting the shooter.”  A moment later, an armed police officer entered the patio area, and Mr. Vorhies quickly left, he said. The dining area can be reached from an adjacent parking structure without an employee badge, Mr. Vorhies said. By 2:15 p.m., President Trump had been briefed on the attack. He tweeted a short time later: “Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube’s HQ in San Bruno, California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene.” 
            Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube’s HQ in San Bruno, California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene.         Cameron Rogers Polan, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Division of the F.B.I., said in an email that the agency was in contact with the San Bruno police. The San Francisco division of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives tweeted that it, too, was responding to the shooting. Google said on Twitter that it was “coordinating with authorities.” “I know a lot of you are in shock right now,” Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said in a statement posted to Twitter. “Over the coming days, we will continue to provide support to help everyone in our Google family heal from this unimaginable tragedy.” Executives at other Silicon Valley companies took to Twitter to send their condolences to YouTube employees. “From everyone at Apple, we send our sympathy and support to the team at YouTube and Google, especially the victims and their families,” Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, wrote. Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, wrote on Twitter: “I can’t imagine what our friends at YouTube are feeling and dealing with right now. We‘re here for you and your families and friends.” Others, including a trauma surgeon at the hospital where shooting victims were taken, expressed anger at continued gun violence.  “You’d think that after we’ve seen Las Vegas, Parkland, the Pulse nightclub shooting, that we would see an end to this, but we have not,” the surgeon, Dr. Andre Campbell, told reporters Tuesday afternoon. An earlier version of this article misquoted a comment made by Nasim Najafi Aghdam in one of her YouTube videos. She said, “This is what they are doing to vegan activists and many other people who try to promote healthy, humane and smart living,” not “what they are doing to weekend activists.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the city in California where Ms. Aghdam’s last known address was. It is Menifee, not Menefee. Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Bruno, and Maggie Astor, Maya Salam and Matt Stevens from New York. Reporting was contributed by Cade Metz from San Bruno; Nellie Bowles, Jack Nicas and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco; Daniel Victor, Keith Collins and Liam Stack from New York; and Austin Ramzy in Hong Kong.

Learning,400," Supported by By Natalie Proulx and Katherine Schulten Updated: Feb. 20, 2018: We have continued to add to this post since we first published it on Feb. 15, and have included many more resources around the role of student voice. We have also added a related Student Opinion question to which your class is invited to respond: Can High School Students Make a Real Impact on the Problem of Gun Violence in the United States? Please let us know what we may be missing, or post your own thoughts, ideas or experiences. __________ By now your students know about the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. How are you addressing it in your classroom? Please let us know in the comments. We asked that question on social media on the morning of Feb. 15, and immediately got advice from several teachers. Cheryl M. Morin wrote: This morning, I’ll be asking them what they have heard, creating opportunity to verbalize as well as acknowledge their feelings. We’ll spend some time either writing or drawing as a way to release the energy. We’ll review lockdown procedures for our school. We will do this daily. We also heard from Clara Green, a social emotional learning coach in Atlanta’s public schools. She sent this email to the teachers she supports: I am absolutely heartbroken by the horrific school shooting in Parkland, Florida. This morning, it is more critical than ever than we make students feel welcomed at school. Many of your students may come to school with strong emotions and questions and we must provide a safe space for them to cope with this traumatic event. In talking about this event with elementary-aged students, she and the American School Counselor Association recommend doing the following: • Trying to keep routines as normal as possible. Kids gain security from the predictability of routine, including attending school. • Limiting exposure to television and the news. • Being honest with kids and share with them as much information as they are developmentally able to handle. • Listening to kids’ fears and concerns. • Reassuring kids that the world is a good place to be, but that there are people who do bad things. • Rebuilding and reaffirming attachments and relationships. Another teacher, Kristin Hunt Runyon, said she will be doing the following: Reviewing Alice (Active Shooter Civilian Response Training) protocol Reminding students to report warning signs of mental health issues and possible threats to an adult Explaining why my classroom door will remain locked every day from now on because it is the only tool we have to protect our students inside the classroom. And Stacy Matros Hardcastle wrote about the role of school in students’ lives: We have to make our schools places where students feel a human connection. Places where they would never, ever think to bring a gun to campus. If there is ever even a whisper that someone has the plan to bring a gun, our teachers and students should be able to communicate freely with law enforcement so that those plans are stopped. There need to be policies that would have allowed physical intervention as soon as yesterday’s shooter posted one of the many disturbing things he did on his social media. We need to protect each other. Because The Learning Network is for students 13 and older, the resources below focus on understanding this shooting and its implications, but parents and teachers of younger students might find this advice, published by The Times after the shooting in Newton, Conn., helpful. Our friends at Scholastic also offer these Resources for Responding to Violence and Tragedy. Before addressing any traumatic event with students of any age, however, you might read our advice on talking about sensitive issues in the news. We have also created a forum where students can share their thoughts. Invite yours to post answers to the question, “What Is Your Reaction to the Deadly Shooting at a Florida High School?“ We will continue to update this post. _________ Understand What Happened and React to It To learn more about the shooting on Feb. 14 and its aftermath, students might read the article “Florida School Shooting Death Toll Is at 17 and Could Rise” and answer these questions: 1. How many people were killed and injured in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.? 2. Who was the gunman? What weapons did he use? What has he been charged with? 3. What evidence do the police have that shows the attack was premeditated, or planned? 4. How does this school shooting compare with others in modern United States history? 5. What were the initial responses of parents and school officials to the attack? 6. How did students describe the scene inside the school? 7. After learning more about what happened, what are your reactions to this tragedy? You can continue to follow the latest updates here, and your students can post their thoughts about what they read in answer to this related Student Opinion question: “What Is Your Reaction to the Deadly Shooting at a Florida High School?“ _________ Recognize and Honor the Victims and Heroes Have students read about the 14 children and 3 adults who lost their lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and think about the different ways they could be commemorated. Students might create a collage or bulletin board profile of the victims, perhaps modeling them on a Times feature like the annual Lives They Lived or the Portraits of Grief series, which profiled those lost in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Amid this tragedy, there are also stories of great courage and benevolence. Encourage your students to look for “the helpers” — those that risked their own lives and safety to help others. What heroic acts have they read about? What acts of service can students offer to recognize, honor and celebrate the victims? Brainstorm ways you may be able to offer condolences to the families or the community of Parkland, Fla., or do a related service learning project that grows out of students’ thoughts and feelings about these events, the victims’ lives, the needs of school communities, or actions they can take to prevent tragedies like this in the future. _________ School Shootings in Context Since 26 people were killed in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, a nonprofit that tracks school shootings has recorded five a month, on average. Invite students to study the graphic above. What does it say about school shootings in the United States? What does that make them think and feel? Why? In the related article, Jugal K. Patel writes: More than 40 “active shooter” episodes in schools have been recorded in the United States since 2000, according to F.B.I. and news reports. Two 15-year-old students were killed and 18 more people were injured last month in a school in rural Benton, Ky. The shootings have become common enough that many schools, including Stoneman Douglas High, run annual drills in which students practice huddling in classrooms behind locked doors. With the Parkland shooting, three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern United States history have come in the last five months. In fact, lockdown drills are now such a common feature of the school experience that a high school student who was one of the winners of our Editorial Contest last year wrote an essay, “Stopping Bullets With Locked Doors and Silence Is Already Pulling the Trigger.” In it she argues: It has become very familiar for high-school students to practice the infamous level-three lockdown. In all cases, we all share the semi-nervous chuckle of “wow, maybe we get Swiss-cheesed today” and sit in a corner, stare at our phones and text our friends. Only very recently, after a vivid dream — more a nightmare — of a school shooting, did I realize that sitting in the dark and stopping bullets with locked doors and silence is the exact opposite of what one would want to do. It wasn’t until I stumbled upon the fact that the “people shot and killed in the Columbine library sat there for five minutes before the shooters entered and shot them.” My school is full of able-bodied kids, and surprisingly, a great chunk that has had experience with self-defense and even marksmen training. So why sit and wait? Has your school been affected by gun violence? What measures do you have in place to prevent future violence, or to respond to threats? Ask students to investigate if they can’t answer that question, then discuss: Do you think your school and community are doing enough to prevent future shootings? If not, what else do you think they should do? What do you think individual students can do, if anything? _________  Are We Becoming “Numb” to School Shootings? Thousands of readers have commented on the article about the Parkland shooting. One by Tom from Vermont sums up what he’s read: The comments here seem so stark and brief. Understandably so, what is left to say? It is becoming so easy to see a headline like the one on this story and shrug. This is the new America. But is it? Something inside me still makes me think we have the resolve to turn this terrible tide. On The Learning Network, we responded to a shooting in Benton, Ky. in January by posing the question, Are We Becoming ‘Numb’ to School Shootings? It was in reaction to an article headlined, “School Shooting in Kentucky Was Nation’s 11th of Year. It Was Jan. 23.” Seventy students answered, and the question is still open to comment if your students would like to weigh in. Nathanie Doralus from Florida wrote: As a student, I agree that we’ve become numb to the news of school shootings in the United States. My high school has already had two lockdowns this school year because of students bringing guns onto the campus. It happens so often that I think many feel powerless to stop them so the default is to either ignore them or solemnly shake your head in silence. In some ways, I think it’s an attempt to not live in constant fear while attending school and receiving an education because no one should have to. But in other ways, I think some won’t take it seriously until it hits close to home. If we were taking school shootings more seriously than before, then there wouldn’t have been eleven incidents already in the first month of this year. Very few people take active assailant drills at my school seriously. I think that is just an example of denial and how it’s hard to take something seriously unless it actually happens to you or someone you know. Schools can do more than just increasing their security measures and frequently enacting drills. They can also invest in the mental health and well-being of their students and provide the support some of them need in order to prevent these acts of violence. And Jocelyn Savard from North Carolina shared this perspective: In Boston, there are a series of billboards promoting gun violence awareness. One reads “Americans killed since the massacre at Sandy Hook” and has a live count of citizen owned gun deaths displayed. I remember walking around a few years ago and being startled at the number. When Sandy Hook happened and my mom told me, I cried for days. Just a few days ago when the notifications showed up on my phone about Kentucky, I barely blinked an eye. Of course, my heart plummeted and I could feel humanity’s downfall one step closer but there was no tears, at church this weekend there was no announcement, no prayer. As a country, we have normalized school shootings so much, made books and movies out of them, make offhand comments about how that guy ‘looks like a school shooter’, that we are rapidly becoming detached to the horror that we call our home. Do your students agree with these teenagers that “we are rapidly becoming detached to the horror” of school shootings? Why or why not? How has this latest attack affected them? What do they think we might do to keep from becoming “detached”? _________ The Role of Students: Cellphones and Social Media  Technology has allowed the public to witness mass shootings in new and terrifying ways. The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School used their cellphones and social media accounts in real time to share their experiences and spread messages of pain, anger and gratitude, as well as calls to action. In “As Shots Ring Out, a Student Texts: ‘If I Don’t Make It, I Love You,’” Audra D.S. Burch and Patricia Mazzei write: One student hit her record button while being led out of the school to safety by sheriff’s deputies. On her way, her cellphone’s shaking camera lens passed over several bodies sprawled on the floor. In another cellphone video, several dozen gunshots were audible not far away. “Oh my God! Oh my God!” one student shouted. Like many school districts, Broward County’s allows high school students to bring cellphones to school, so long as they don’t interfere with class work. On Wednesday, many students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School held onto their phones for dear life as a 19-year-old gunman, Nikolas Cruz, stalked the grounds and fatally shot 17 people. They used them to keep their terrified parents informed about what was happening. And they used them to keep a visual record of an awful crime. Hiding in a sweltering storage room with about 40 other students, she typed out a text message to her mother, Stacy, for what she thought might be the last time. “If I don’t make it,” she wrote, “I love you and I appreciate everything you did for me.” Students also took to Twitter to post the texts they thought might be their last to their family and friends: Ask your students: Whare are your reactions to these firsthand accounts of the violence that took place in Parkland, Fla.? How have these videos impacted the public conversation around guns and school safety? Why do you think they have had such a dramatic effect? Do you think the fact that your generation is so fluent in social media gives you a voice previous generations did not have? What might be the benefits and drawbacks of that if so? __________ The Role of Students: ”They Survived the School Shooting. Now They’re Calling for Action” On Feb. 15, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School implored lawmakers to act to prevent future violence, calling the frequency of school shootings in the United States “unacceptable.” “Ideas are great, ideas are wonderful and they help you get re-elected and everything, but what’s more important is actual action,” the student, David Hogg, said on CNN. Mr. Hogg, whose younger sister lost two friends in the shooting, called on politicians to act. “We’re children,” he said. “You guys are the adults.” Since then, as The Times writes, “youthful voices have resonated where those of longtime politicians have largely fallen flat,” and many see in that a reason for hope. As David Leonhardt writes: ...the movement to reduce gun violence seems to have a new energy, driven by students — who of course have provided much of the energy for previous political movements. Individual schools have already held or planned walkouts. A nationwide protest is scheduled for March 14, with help from organizers of the Women’s March. Teachers are also talking about mass protest, as Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick explains. In “A ‘Mass Shooting Generation’ Cries Out for Change,” The Times points out that teenagers today have grown up with code-red drills, and they have a perspective many adults do not: This is life for the children of the mass shooting generation. They were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, and grew up practicing active shooter drills and huddling through lockdowns. They talked about threats and safety steps with their parents and teachers. With friends, they wondered darkly whether it could happen at their own school, and who might do it. Now, this generation is almost grown up. And when a gunman killed 17 students this week at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., the first response of many of their classmates was not to grieve in silence, but to speak out. Their urgent voices — in television interviews, on social media, even from inside a locked school office as they hid from the gunman — are now rising in the national debate over gun violence in the aftermath of yet another school shooting. While many politicians after the shooting were focused on mental health and safety, some vocal students at Stoneman Douglas High showed no reluctance in drawing attention to gun control. They called out politicians over Twitter, with one student telling Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, “YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND.” Shortly after the shooting, Cameron Kasky, a junior at the school, and a few friends started a “Never Again” campaign on Facebook that shared stories and perspectives from other students who survived the rampage. What do your students think about these activist teenagers and their messages? What messages or ideas resonate with them the most? Can their generation effect real change on gun violence? How? What examples are they reading or hearing about — or witnessing themselves — that seem to be having an impact? What are their own personal opinions about what should be done, how and why? What can each of us do as individuals, and what can people their age do together? As many have pointed out, it was widespread student activism during the era of the civil rights movement and the war in Vietnam that helped “change history.” And as we learned from the students who participated in our recent News Diet Challenge, teenagers can feel overwhelmed by the news unless they can find a way to act on what they read. To learn more, invite them to read “Emma González Leads a Student Outcry on Guns: ‘This Is the Way I Have to Grieve’” and watch the related videos, including the one below: They can also read an Op-Ed in The Times by a freshman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. In “Don’t Let My Classmates’ Deaths Be in Vain,” Christine Yared writes: We can’t let innocent people’s deaths be in vain. We need to work together beyond political parties to make sure this never happens again. We need tougher gun laws. If a person is not old enough to be able to rent a car or buy a beer, then he should not be able to legally purchase a weapon of mass destruction. This could have been prevented. If the killer had been properly treated for his mental illness, maybe this would not have happened. If there were proper background checks, then those who should not have guns would not have them. We need to vote for those who are for stricter laws and kick out those who won’t take action. We need to expose the truth about gun violence and the corruption around guns. Please. Invite your class to respond to the Student Opinion question we have posted: Can High School Students Make a Real Impact on the Problem of Gun Violence in the United States? And if they are interested in more ideas for taking action beyond those these young people have already suggested, our lesson plan Ideas for Student Civic Action in a Time of Social Uncertainty might offer ideas. _________ The AR-15 and Gun Control The New York Times reports that the gunman who killed 17 people and injured others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School used an AR-15 assault rifle. This style of rifle was also used in the attacks in Newtown, Conn.; Aurora, Colo.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex., among others. Students might watch the video above, then discuss: What are some of the reasons that the AR-15, and other weapons like it, have become so common in mass shootings? How does it compare with other types of guns? In recent years the regulation of the sale of this style of rifle has come to the forefront of the national gun debate. In a 2017 appeal to the Connecticut Supreme Court, relatives of victims in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School argued: The companies that manufactured and sold the military-style assault rifle used by the gunman should be held responsible for the 2012 attack. A lawsuit filed by the relatives said that the AR-15-style Bushmaster used to carry out the shooting in Newtown, Conn., that killed 26 people, including 20 first graders, was specifically marketed as a weapon of war, with slogans and product placement in video games invoking the violence of combat. The lawsuit claims that such promotions were a deliberate effort to make the weapon attractive to young men, like Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old gunman. At the same time, “the National Rifle Association has taken to calling the AR-15 ‘America’s rifle’” and “gun owners say that the AR-15 is used for hunting, sport shooting and self-defense.” Ask students: Do you think AR-15-style rifles should be more strictly regulated in the United States? Why or why not? Do you think any other measures should be taken to restrict access to guns? If so, what? If not, what else can be done to prevent more mass shootings like this one? Students might read how others responded to these questions after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and add their voices to the conversation by commenting here since that post is now closed. Or, take a look at the forum on guns we posted during the 2016 election as part of our Civil Conversation Challenge  for teenagers. We invited students to have productive, respectful conversations on several issues dividing Americans, and more than 700 responses came in to the questions we posed about gun rights, the Second Amendment and more. Update: The Times has now published a piece that summarizes political responses: “Right and Left React to the Gun Control Debate After the Florida Shooting.” _________ Only in the United States? In “How to Reduce Shootings,” the columnist Nicholas Kristof writes: Inevitably, predictably, fatefully, another mass shooting breaks our hearts. This time, it was a school shooting in Florida on Wednesday that left at least 17 dead at the hands of 19-year-old gunman and his AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. But what is perhaps most heartbreaking of all is that they shouldn’t be shocking. People all over the world become furious and try to harm others, but only in the United States do we suffer such mass shootings so regularly; only in the United States do we lose one person every 15 minutes to gun violence. He writes that we should “learn lessons from these tragedies, so that there can be fewer of them. In particular, I suggest that we try a new approach to reducing gun violence — a public health strategy.” Invite your students to take a look at the graphics from a visual essay he did in November after the church shooting in Texas. What do they see? What questions do the charts raise? To what extent do they agree with Mr. Kristof’s conclusions? ___________ The Gunman What do authorities know so far about the shooter? What is not yet known? In “Nikolas Cruz, Florida Shooting Suspect, Was Expelled From School,” Matthew Haag and Serge F. Kovaleski write: The man suspected of opening fire inside a Florida high school on Wednesday, killing at least 17 people, is a former student who had been expelled for disciplinary reasons, the authorities said. … In the hours after the shooting, people who knew Mr. Cruz described him as a “troubled kid” who enjoyed showing off his firearms, bragging about killing animals and whose mother would resort to calling the police to have them come to their home to try to talk some sense into him. At a school with about 3,000 students, Mr. Cruz stayed to himself and had few friends but struck fear in some students with erratic behavior and an affinity for violence. … In the interview with the Miami news station, the student said Mr. Cruz was a junior at Stoneman Douglas High School when he was expelled last year. He said that students would joke that if anyone were to open fire inside the school, it would be Mr. Cruz. Because of that, students feared him and mostly stayed away from him, the student said. “A lot of people were saying that it would be him,” the student told WFOR-TV. “They would say he would be the one to shoot up the school. Everyone predicted it.” In “Nikolas Cruz’s Lifetime of Trouble: Family Loss, Flashes of Rage,” The Times writes that he has been “causing trouble as long as anyone here could remember.” Do you think this attack could have been prevented? If so, how? If not, why not? What might school administrators, teachers and students be able to learn from this attack to prevent others like it from happening? How could they respond to students who may be showing signs of trouble in school, on social media or at home? What — if anything — should students do if they encounter others who display erratic behavior or inclinations toward violence? _________ Related Learning Network Resources Resources: Talking and Teaching About the Shooting in Newtown, Conn.

                Tech We’re Using             By                     
                                    HANNA INGBER
                            
                APRIL 4, 2018 How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Hanna Ingber, editorial director of The Times’s Reader Center, discussed the tech she’s using. The Reader Center collects story ideas and feedback on our coverage from readers. What have been the most important tech tools for engaging with our audience? We use a variety of tools to listen to our readers and respond to them. We need that variety because readers are talking about our coverage on so many different platforms — our own site, Twitter, Facebook and more. Plus, there are readers contacting us directly by email and phone. We even received a letter in the mail — which I promptly Instagrammed. Twitter can be very useful for quickly knowing how readers are reacting to our coverage, but it’s also very noisy. The social media dashboard Tweetdeck makes a big difference. I set up columns that help me sort through the high volume of tweets and find the ones that are most important to me. For example, I have a column that shows me every time a tweet mentioning The New York Times is getting a lot of attention. Facebook is also crucial to our work. We can use it to get feedback on our coverage and reach out to our readers, asking them about the news or their communities.  One of my colleagues on the Reader Center, Josie Sedgwick, wanted to know what the long winters are like for our readers who live around the Arctic Circle. She put together a series of questions using an in-house tool called Formacist, and then posted that on Facebook, targeting readers who live in countries in that region. She was hoping to hear from maybe a dozen readers; she heard from 700. (And their responses were breathtaking.)  Facebook Live enables us to have candid and accessible back-and-forth discussions between our journalists and our audience. A recent thought-provoking example was a Race/NYT chat with hosts John Eligon and Rachel Swarns discussing adoptions that cross racial and ethnic lines. We also use email, and the comments system on our site. Plus, our colleagues send us interesting or useful feedback they spot through our Reader Center Slack group. And then there’s text message. My brother-in-law happens to be very good at spotting criticism of our coverage that is bubbling up on Twitter and probably will deserve our attention. On the weekends, when I am less active on Twitter, he’s my early warning system. What could be better? Many of our colleagues wish they had a better sense of what our readers are saying about their coverage. There is a lot of feedback to keep up with and sort through. We’d love to have a tool that would enable us to aggregate reader feedback (emails, social media posts, comments and more) in a faster and more systematic way. You’ve invested time in coming up with creative ways to use social media. What are some of your favorite uses of social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat or Instagram?  I appreciate Twitter when reporters bring us along on a journey, telling a story with their tweets. Rukmini Callimachi, our correspondent who covers Islamist extremism, took her followers along as she traveled with an embed into western Mosul, for example, introducing us to villagers and showing us what she saw. When Julie Turkewitz, a national correspondent, traveled with a group of students from Parkland, Fla., to the state capital to demand more gun control, she tweeted scenes from the bus along the way. Her tweets were gripping and immediate, and they gave us a window into a scene we couldn’t have otherwise gotten.  Twitter is also an indispensable tool for journalists and just about anyone else to be part of a conversation about the news as it’s unfolding. While journalists are on Twitter, the bulk of our readers are on Facebook. At The Times, we regularly use Facebook to reach our readers and ask them to participate in our coverage. I also prefer Facebook for its sense of community. Facebook groups tend to be closed, so people are writing posts to a segment of people. Perhaps because the posts are not for the wider public, there seems to be a lot less posturing on Facebook than on Twitter. Do you have a personal favorite Facebook group? My guilty pleasure is scrolling through the Maplewood Moms* Facebook group. (I live in a neighboring New Jersey town.) Local parents post questions that are incredibly relevant to my life, like how to get your toddler to brush his teeth. There are discussions on managing a commute and bedtimes, and horror stories of lactation rooms that don’t lock. Even though I don’t know all of the mothers, or even most of them, I feel a sense of shared values and experiences. We can so easily relate to one another, battling toddler meltdowns and long waits at the pediatrician’s office. And this leads to an online environment that feels both intimate and supportive. What other tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life? I tried the Apple Watch and could barely figure it out. So I’ll say my phone (an iPhone 7 with a maroon and purple case). Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.     My entire life exists on my phone. For nonwork purposes, I love that I have a camera and video recorder with me wherever I am — crucial for a parent of young children. I do my banking, listen to podcasts, read, and jot down funny things my 4-year-old, Isaac, says. And I wrote out these answers on my phone (in the Notes app) while getting my hair cut.  Smartphones now also make for easy house stalking. I love going to a dinner party and then checking out the person’s home on Zillow. My husband and I often play a game to guess how much we think the house sold for. (Life in the suburbs is underrated.) In our own home, our kids love using our Amazon Echo. Isaac asks it all sorts of important life questions (like “Alexa, do you like bubbles?”). He also orders up his favorite songs, then he and his little brother dance around the kitchen. I wish there were a feature on my phone that could make it quickly obvious to others what I am doing on it. I grew up watching my parents read the newspaper over breakfast. I wish that when I was reading the news, my kids could tell. Instead, they just see my head in my phone. That is the major reason I still get the Sunday paper.

National,402," By DANA GOLDSTEINAPRIL 2, 2018 Public school teachers in Oklahoma and Kentucky protested at their state capitols to demand higher pay, better benefits and more money for education. Thousands of teachers in Oklahoma and Kentucky walked off the job Monday morning, shutting down school districts as they protested cuts in pay, benefits and school funding in a movement that has spread rapidly since igniting in West Virginia this year. In Oklahoma City, protesting teachers ringed the Capitol, chanting, “No funding, no future!” Katrina Ruff, a local teacher, carried a sign that read, “Thanks to West Virginia.” “They gave us the guts to stand up for ourselves,” she said. The walkouts and rallies in Republican-dominated states, mainly organized by ordinary teachers on Facebook, have caught lawmakers and sometimes the teachers’ own labor unions flat-footed. And they are occurring in states and districts with important midterm races in November, suggesting that thousands of teachers, with their pent-up rage over years of pay freezes and budget cuts, are set to become a powerful political force this fall. The next red state to join the protest movement could be Arizona, where there is an open Senate seat and where thousands of teachers gathered in Phoenix last week to demand a 20 percent pay raise and more funding for schools.  The growing fervor suggests that labor activism has taken on a new, grass-roots form. “Our unions have been weakened so much that a lot of teachers don’t have faith” in them, said Noah Karvelis, an elementary school music teacher in Tolleson, Ariz., outside Phoenix, and leader of the movement calling itself #RedforEd, after the red T-shirts protesting teachers are wearing across the country.  Mr. Karvelis said that younger teachers had been primed for activism by their anger over the election of President Trump, his appointment of Betsy DeVos as education secretary and even their own students’ participation in anti-gun protests after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. “Teachers for a long time have had a martyr mentality,” Mr. Karvelis said. “This is new.” The wave of protest is cresting as the Supreme Court prepares a decision in Janus v. Afscme, a major case in which the court is expected to make it harder for public sector unions to require workers to pay membership fees. But the recent walkouts suggest that labor activism may not need highly funded unions to be effective. Unlike in strongholds for labor, like New York or California, teachers’ unions in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Arizona are barred by law from compelling workers to pay dues. Yet that has not stopped protesters from making tough demands of lawmakers. Striking West Virginia teachers declared victory last month after winning a 5 percent raise, but Oklahoma educators are holding out for more. Last week, the Legislature in Oklahoma City voted to provide teachers with an average raise of $6,000 per year, or roughly a 16 percent raise, depending on experience. Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican, signed the package into law. Teachers said it was not enough. They have asked for a $10,000 raise, as well as additional funding for schools and raises for support staff like bus drivers and custodians. About 200 of the state’s 500 school districts shut down on Monday as teachers walked out, defying calls from some parents and administrators for them to be grateful for what they had already received from the state. To pay for the raise, politicians from both parties agreed to increase production taxes on oil and gas, the state’s most prized industry, and institute new taxes on tobacco and motor fuel. It was the first new revenue bill to become law in Oklahoma in 28 years, bucking decades of tax-cut orthodoxy. Required fields are marked with an asterisk.  You have 250 words left.

And you agree to our Terms of Service. Thank you for your submission. In Kentucky, teachers earn an average salary of $52,000, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, compared with $45,000 in Oklahoma. But teachers there, thousands of whom are picketing the Capitol during their spring break, are protesting a pension reform bill that abruptly passed the State House and Senate last week. If Gov. Matt Bevin signs it into law, it will phase out defined-benefit pensions for teachers and replace them with hybrid retirement plans that combine features of a traditional pension with features of the 401(k) accounts used in the private sector. Teachers in the state are not eligible for Social Security benefits.  Andrew Beaver, 32, a middle school math teacher in Louisville, said he was open to changes in teacher retirement programs, such as potentially asking teachers to work to an older age before drawing down benefits; currently, some Kentucky teachers are eligible for retirement around age 50. But he said he and his colleagues, many of whom have called in sick to protest the bill, were angry about not having a seat at the negotiation table with Mr. Bevin, a Republican, and the Republican majority in the Legislature. “What I’m seeing in Louisville is teachers are a lot more politically engaged than they were in 2015 or 2016,” he said. “It really is a wildfire.”      In Arizona, where the average teacher salary is $47,000, teachers are agitating for more generous pay and more money for schools after watching the state slash funds to public education for years. “We’re going to continue to escalate our actions,” Mr. Karvelis said. “Whether that ultimately ends in a strike? That’s certainly a possibility. We just want to win.” Mr. Karvelis, 23, said teachers would not walk out of class unless they were able to win support from parents and community members across the state, including in rural areas. But he said the movement would be influential regardless of whether it shuts down schools. “We’re going to have a lot of teachers at the ballot box who I don’t think would normally go in a midterm year,” he said. “If I were a legislator right now, I’d be honestly sweating bullets.” With Republican legislators and governors bearing the brunt of the protesters’ fury, the Democratic Party is trying to capitalize on the moment. The Democratic National Committee plans to register voters at teacher rallies, and hopes to harness the movement’s populism. The teacher walkouts are “a real rejection of the Republican agenda that doesn’t favor working-class people,” said Sabrina Singh, the committee’s deputy communications director. “Republicans aren’t on the side of teachers. The Democrats are.”  That type of rhetoric is a sea change from the Obama years, when many Democrats angered teachers by talking less about core issues of schools funding than about expanding the number of charter schools, or using student test scores to evaluate teachers and remove ineffective ones from the classroom. “School reformers kind of overshot the mark, and we’re now in a pendulum swing where teachers increasingly look like good guys,” said Frederick Hess, director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. Republicans, too, he said, should consider pitching themselves as teacher-friendly candidates, perhaps by tying teacher pay raises to efforts to expand school choice through private school vouchers or charter schools. Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers’ union, called the movement an “education spring.” “This is the civics lesson of our time,” she said. “The politicians on both sides of the aisle are rubbing the sleep out of their eyes.” Ben Fenwick contributed reporting.

                APRIL 2, 2018 Updated, 9:20 a.m. Good morning on this suddenly snowy Monday. Surprise! Outside your window, a small spring snowstorm is busy blanketing our region. The fast-moving storm blew in last night and could drop three to five inches of heavy, wet snow on the city by this afternoon. The snowfall is predicted to be heaviest until 11 a.m. — perfectly timed to muck up your morning commute. (Before heading out, check for service changes on the subway, Metro-North, the Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit and Amtrak.)  With temperatures hovering around freezing this morning, you may want to pop on your earmuffs and take an umbrella, as the snow could be mixed with rain by this afternoon.  A winter weather advisory is in effect until 2 p.m., which means roads could be slippery and visibility may be reduced. But whatever you do, don’t call this storm a nor’easter. While we may have just celebrated a rare “four’easter,” with four nor’easters pummeling our region within a month, today’s storm will not be the fifth. “The magnitude of this storm is not quite up to par,” said John Murray, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. For a storm to qualify as a nor’easter, he explained, it must meet a few conditions, including sustained winds of 34 knots, or around 39 miles per hour. Wind gusts today are expected to reach only 25 miles per hour, leaving the storm with the less-sexy label of “quick-moving low pressure system.” Still, the storm was strong enough to postpone the Yankees home opener against the Tampa Bay Rays until tomorrow. Expect to forget all about it by this afternoon, when we should see sunshine and a high of 44. April showers — two days of them — start tomorrow.

Washington,404," By ERICA L. GREEN and MANNY FERNANDEZMARCH 1, 2018 SIDNEY, Ohio — The 8-by-11-inch box sits atop a bookshelf in the district headquarters, as much a part of the office furniture as the manila folders, yearbooks and Webster’s dictionaries. Inside is a semiautomatic Glock handgun with extra magazines, equipment that education leaders here say will prevent this district from suffering the next schoolhouse tragedy. Dispersed throughout the seven school buildings in this rural Ohio district outside of Dayton are dozens of biometric safes, tucked away discreetly in closets and classrooms, only accessible to a designated staff member whose fingerprint can open the box. A bulletproof vest is nearby, in an undisclosed location, fortified to protect against any bullet except one fired from an assault rifle. “We can’t stop an active shooter, but we can minimize the carnage,” said John Scheu, the superintendent of Sidney City Schools. After the latest mass shooting, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last month, President Trump amplified calls to train and arm educators, roiling the teaching profession and infuriating gun control advocates who see yet another inappropriate — and potentially disastrous — duty being heaped on teachers. For all the outcry, though, hundreds of school districts across the country, most of them small and rural, already have. Officials like those here in Sidney do not see the weaponry scattered through their schools as a political statement, but as a practical response to a potent threat.  The push for others to follow their lead has almost instantly ignited a backlash. A hashtag emerged on social media, #ArmMeWith, followed by a litany of suggestions from teachers other than guns: books, science equipment, computers and better pay. A cartoon depicting a teacher struggling underneath the weight of her responsibilities — social worker, drug detector, disciplinarian — was shared on social media more than 100,000 times.  While the president was talking up armaments and bonuses for teachers who volunteer for weapons training, dispirited educators in West Virginia walked out of their schools, seeking what they say would be simply a living wage. “Doesn’t it get to be too much?” said Brianne Solomon, a veteran West Virginia teacher who supplies food for her students’ families, signs students’ permission slips if parents can’t and recently got one to the eye doctor. “On top of all the things we do, to have to remember when we’re supposed to use a gun?” But the Trump administration has elevated the issue to something of an educational mission. The president insisted that he personally would charge into a school, even unarmed, to challenge a gunman. Frank Brogan, a former Florida lieutenant governor who has been nominated for assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education, carries an unusual credential: When he was an assistant principal, Mr. Brogan chased down an armed teenager, talked him into lowering his weapon, then grabbed his arm and wrestled it away. But even many educators who have faced off with a school gunman oppose the president’s idea. Every day for five and a half years, Jesse Wasmer said, he has thought about the moment that he tackled a student who had just fired a shotgun into the back of a classmate in the cafeteria of a suburban Baltimore high school. “Never have I thought, ‘I wish I’d had a gun,’” Mr. Wasmer said. Mr. Wasmer, who was a guidance counselor at Perry Hall High School when a student opened fire there in 2012, called the president’s assertions “simplistic and misguided.” “I think as educators we’re trained to nurture kids and foster kids, and our first instinct is to not shoot or harm them,” he said. “What we need is more caring adults in these kids’ lives, not more guns.” Officials here in this town of 20,000 do not swagger. “I agree with those folks who say teachers should teach and cops should be cops, but we got a mess on our hands,” said Sheriff John Lenhart of Shelby County, who gave up his National Rifle Association membership in the 1990s. “If I have to wait on state officials, on the federal government, on psychologists to figure out why people hurt one another, we would have nothing in our school system.”  Since 2013, in response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., legislation in state capitals across the country has sought to arm school staff. At least 10 states allow staff members to possess or have access to a firearm on school grounds, according to an analysis by the Education Commission of the States. And local districts have varied their approach to arming educators — in Ohio, guns are kept in safes; in Texas, they can be worn in holsters or kept in safes within immediate reach. A Florida state legislative committee approved a $67 million “school marshal” program this week to train and arm teachers — over the vocal opposition of Parkland residents. In Texas, some public school systems have been quietly arming teachers and administrators for more than a decade. Teachers and other school personnel who volunteer to undergo specialized training receive approval to either carry a concealed firearm in school or have one within reach. Lawmakers, educators and advocates for gun rights said Texas’ school marshal and school guardian programs have eased fears of armed intruders and have not led to any firearm accidents or mishaps. The state’s programs could serve as a model for schools around the country, advocates say. One rural district, Harrold Independent School District, has been allowing armed personnel to carry concealed firearms on school grounds as part of its guardian program since 2007, one year after a shooting at an Amish school in Pennsylvania. “This clearly is the solution to the problem that we’re seeing around the country, and I think the president has recognized that,” said State Representative Jason Villalba, a Dallas Republican who wrote the law that established the school-marshal program. At a meeting at the White House with other governors on Monday, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, told Mr. Trump that in more than 100 school districts in Texas, teachers and other personnel carry a weapon and are trained to respond to an attack. “Candidly, some school districts, they promote it,” the governor told the president. “Because they will have signs out front — a warning sign: ‘Be aware, there are armed personnel on campus’ — warning anybody coming on there that they — if they attempt to cause any harm, they’re going to be in trouble.”  In Ohio, which allows local school boards to decide who can possess or have access to firearms on school grounds, Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, also supports arming teachers. Ohio’s teachers’ unions have mobilized against the widespread arming of teachers in schools, arguing that gun control, not armed clashes, will protect students. “We appreciate that there are teachers that are willing to take this extra step. It comes from a good place,” said Melissa Cropper, the president of the Ohio Federation of Teachers. “But when you start thinking about all that could go wrong in that situation, there are too many risks involved.” Like many districts, Sidney City Schools was shaken by the slaughter of 20 first graders and six staff members at Sandy Hook in 2012. In the following days, Sheriff Lenhart presented Mr. Scheu with an equation: Every 17 seconds after the first shots are fired and the first 911 call is made, somebody gets hurt or dies. “Even in the best-case scenario, we could get here in four to five minutes,” Sheriff Lenhart said. “You do the math.” Within a year, Sheriff Lenhart had led what he calls a “layered” approach to school security and a “conservative” approach to arming teachers in the 3,400-student school district. The district spent about $70,000 on safes, bulletproof vests, cameras, guns, radios and ammunition. Uniformed, armed officers cost $200,000 a year, and an insurance policy of $100,000 a year includes coverage for its staff with access to firearms. Those are negligible costs for a school district with a $36 million budget, the superintendent said. “We’re buying time, and it’s of the essence,” Mr. Scheu said. Windows and doors are numbered in the district’s schools, and visitors have to be buzzed in. Each school has a panic button and security camera system that feeds to the sheriff’s office. Every school has a uniformed, armed guard, mostly retired sheriff’s deputies, every day from bell to bell. The high school has a specially trained officer and a bulletproof window between the secretary and visitors.  And if all else fails, there’s a secret group of 40 educators — teachers, principals, custodians, secretaries — called a “first responder team” that can retrieve firearms in under a minute. The team was vetted by Mr. Scheu and Sheriff Lenhart, and completed a 16-hour training course that includes firearm safety, unarmed defensive tactics and basic gunshot first aid. Its members are required to attend a concealed weapons course, as well as additional monthly trainings at either the firing range where they practice marksmanship and in school-based simulations where they practice in the hallways, identifying threats and eliminating them with air guns. Since the team was created, it has responded to one incident, this past August when a student brought a gun to school in his backpack. It did not require a member to retrieve a gun. The measures here met some opposition at first, from the town’s teachers union and police chief, who were concerned about gun safety. But Rick Cron, the armed guard at Sidney Middle School, said he would put members of his team up against any law enforcement officer in Ohio. The state requires that officers fire 25 bullets a year; his team members shoot at least 600. “It’s the teacher’s responsibility to protect the kids, no matter what, and they do it already,” Mr. Cron said, “but without the tools.” Nicki New, the parent of three students in Sidney City Schools, said she felt safer dropping off her children knowing there were staff members equipped to respond to a parent’s worst nightmare. “God forbid, if something would happen, knowing that not only a law enforcement officer is there, but there are teachers in that building who can give my child a fighting chance, is even more reassuring,” Ms. New said. Erica L. Green reported from Sidney, Ohio, and Manny Fernandez from Houston.

Opinion,405," Supported by Gray Matter By Laurence Steinberg The young people who have come forward to call for gun control in the wake of the mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., are challenging the tiresome stereotype of American kids as indolent narcissists whose brains have been addled by smartphones. They offer an inspiring example of thoughtful, eloquent protest. Unfortunately, when it comes to electing lawmakers whose decisions about gun control and other issues affect their lives, these high schoolers lack any real power. This needs to change: The federal voting age in the United States should be lowered from 18 to 16. Skeptics will no doubt raise questions about the competence of 16-year-olds to make informed choices in the voting booth. Aren’t young people notoriously impulsive and hotheaded, their brains not fully developed enough to make good judgments? Yes and no. When considering the intellectual capacity of teenagers, it is important to distinguish between what psychologists call “cold” and “hot” cognition. Cold cognitive abilities are those we use when we are in a calm situation, when we are by ourselves and have time to deliberate and when the most important skill is the ability to reason logically with facts. Voting is a good example of this sort of situation. Studies of cold cognition have shown that the skills necessary to make informed decisions are firmly in place by 16. By that age, adolescents can gather and process information, weigh pros and cons, reason logically with facts and take time before making a decision. Teenagers may sometimes make bad choices, but statistically speaking, they do not make them any more often than adults do. Hot cognitive abilities are those we rely on to make good decisions when we are emotionally aroused, in groups or in a hurry. If you are making a decision when angry or exhausted, the most critical skill is self-regulation, which enables you to control your emotions, withstand pressure from others, resist temptation and check your impulses. Unlike cold cognitive abilities, self-regulation does not mature until about age 22, research has shown. (This is a good reason to raise the minimum age for purchasing firearms from 18 to 21 or older, as some have proposed.) This psychological evidence is backed up by neuroscientific findings. Neuroimaging studies show that brain systems necessary for cold cognition are mature by mid-adolescence, whereas those that govern self-regulation are not fully developed until a person’s early 20s. If the voting age were lowered, would that necessitate changing other laws to bring them into alignment? Of course not. We use a wide variety of chronological ages to draw lines between minors and adults when it comes to smoking, driving, viewing violent or sexually explicit movies, being eligible for the death penalty and drinking alcohol. Although the specific ages used for these purposes often lack a good rationale, there is no reason lowering the voting age would require lowering, say, the drinking age, any more than allowing people to drive at 16 should permit them to drink or smoke at that age as well. In addition to the scientific case for lowering the voting age, there is also a civic argument. Consider the dozen or so countries like Argentina, Austria, Brazil and Nicaragua that allow people to vote at 16 in national, state or local elections. In such countries, voter turnout among 16- and 17-year-olds is significantly higher than it is among older young adults. This is true in parts of the United States as well. In Takoma Park, Md., a city that permits 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections, that age group is twice as likely to vote than are 18-year-olds. Why is higher turnout among 16- and 17-year-olds so important? Because there is evidence that people who don’t vote the first time they are eligible are less likely to vote regularly in the future. Considering that people between 18 and 24 have the lowest voter turnout of any age group in the United States (a country that has one of the lowest rates of voter turnout in the developed world), allowing people to begin voting at an age at which they are more likely to vote might increase future turnout at all ages. The last time the United States lowered the federal voting age was in 1971, when it went from 21 to 18. In that instance, the main motivating force was outrage over the fact that 18-year-olds could be sent to fight in Vietnam but could not vote. The proposal to lower the voting age to 16 is motivated by today’s outrage that those most vulnerable to school shootings have no say in how such atrocities are best prevented. Let’s give those young people more than just their voices to make a change.

Weekend,406," By JESSE GREENMARCH 1, 2018 Everything is the same. And everything is different. And then again, everything is the same. Yes, “Dear Evan Hansen,” which officially introduced Taylor Trensch as its new Evan on Thursday, is still a gut-punching, breathtaking knockout of a musical. But it is differently gut-punching and breathtaking now than it was during the year that Ben Platt led the cast. It would have to be. Even before Mr. Platt opened the show on Broadway, he had been living with Evan Hansen for years: He played the role from the very first reading of the musical in 2014. In some ways it seemed that the authors (songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul; book by Steven Levenson) had sewn the character directly onto his skin. Certainly he yowled as if they had; it’s difficult to recall another Broadway musical performance so saturated with pain and confusion. The role could absorb it, though; when Evan tries to comfort the family of Connor, a schoolmate who has committed suicide, their need for information gets tangled with his need to be noticed and a moral nightmare ensues. Also a practical nightmare, as the lies he tells, amplified by social media, return to haunt him. These are big issues. Playing the anxiety-riddled high school senior, Mr. Platt provoked in the audience a reverse suspension of disbelief: As he cried and belted, often at the same time, it was hard not to fear for the actor’s own well-being. On the two occasions I saw him in the role, I wanted to dose myself afterward with a cocktail of Zoloft and Mucinex.  Mr. Trensch — who recently finished a 10-month run as a zany Barnaby Tucker in “Hello, Dolly!” — is not playing his illustrious predecessor. (Noah Galvin took over the role during a two-month interregnum.) He has pruned Mr. Platt’s armamentarium of tics and twitches to just a few blinks, a stammer and some wringings of the right hand. He is more naturalistically and intermittently troubled than Mr. Platt was, more apprehensible as an actual 17-year-old.  This shifts the gravity of the story somewhat. Mr. Platt’s expressionistic performance made Evan’s descent into a hell of misrepresentation seem inevitable; someone so desperate would of course make those mistakes. He was thus, in a way, blameless and sacrificial. But because Mr. Trensch’s Evan is less tortured, he is also more culpable. You can see him choosing, however ruefully, the wrong path. That deliberateness may inflame the portion of the audience that already objected to the show because Evan does bad things and isn’t horribly punished for it. Go tell it to Pal Joey. Or pick your politician. For me, the shift helps clarify the logic of the story — and the ingenuity of Mr. Levenson’s book. This seems a fair trade for the slight dimming of Evan’s vocal and emotional fireworks.      Another fair trade: With Mr. Trensch’s Evan less dominating, the weight of the story is more evenly distributed among its eight characters. The excellent work of Michael Park as Connor’s stony father and Laura Dreyfuss as his ambivalent sister reveals itself more than ever. (The entire cast has dug deeper into its roles.) I also noticed more clearly how the director Michael Greif’s relentless staging figures in the storytelling, as if it were a ninth character. This is high-def theater: full of color and information wherever you look. But not everything that feels different about “Dear Evan Hansen” is a result of the cast change. A story that turns on a high school tragedy naturally plays differently so soon after the shootings in Parkland, Fla. The audience on Tuesday gasped when a character described Connor’s look as “very school-shooter chic.” And when social media turns his classmates into famous survivors — then turns on them with suspicion and vitriol — I felt almost nostalgic for a time, just a year ago, when that plot point seemed like a stretch. Turns out, it was prescient. Even so, and despite the intensity of interest in the title role, “Dear Evan Hansen” remains — for this father, anyway — most moving as the story of two mothers. Connor’s (Jennifer Laura Thompson) is naturally crushed by the death of her son. Evan’s (Rachel Bay Jones) tirelessly enacts the role of cheerleader-in-chief for her lonely, awkward boy. But both are also dealing with something I suspect every parent in the audience understands: their terrifying responsibility for the happiness of their children, coupled with their marginal ability to do anything about it. When Ms. Jones sang the song “So Big/So Small” near the end of the show on Tuesday, there wasn’t a dry eye in my face. So in fundamental ways, “Dear Evan Hansen” has not changed after all. It has survived the big cast change that many predicted it couldn’t, and, the succession assured, seems likely to thrive on Broadway for the foreseeable future. Critics shouldn’t care about that, of course; box office is not our concern. But if there are going to be long-running Broadway musicals, we can at least mind which ones. A run of three or five or even more years multiplies the impact of a show’s story enormously; such spans are generations in the lives of young theater geeks. Many of those theater geeks see themselves as invisible Evans already, which is why even those who may never see the show in person have it in their earbuds and argue about it online. But eventually a lot of them will also be parents. When they are, they could do worse than recall what “Dear Evan Hansen” says (and sings) about the compromises and heartbreaks of the job.

NYTNow,407," By KAREN ZRAICK and BRENT MURRAYAPRIL 1, 2018 Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. “No amount of kindness or compassion alone would have changed the person that Nikolas Cruz is and was, or the horrendous actions he perpetrated. That is a weak excuse for the failures of our school system, our government and our gun laws.” Among our best-read articles this week was an Op-Ed written by Isabelle Robinson, a senior from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. She wrote the piece because she was disturbed by the notion that the shooting might have been prevented if Mr. Cruz’s classmates were nicer to him. Above, a memorial outside the school after the attack. John Paul Stevens, the retired Supreme Court justice, also wrote a well-read Op-Ed on guns. He labeled the Second Amendment “a relic” and called for its repeal. Did you keep up with the headlines this week? Test your knowledge with our news quiz. Here’s the front page of our Sunday paper, and our crossword puzzles.  ____ 2. President Trump’s advisers are urging tougher policies on Russia after a week of mass expulsions of diplomats. But Mr. Trump has refused to embrace a tough public posture, and remains uncertain how far to authorize his administration to go. Above, the American Embassy in Moscow.  Meanwhile, turnover continued in his administration with the departure of Hope Hicks, the communications director, and David Shulkin, the secretary for veterans affairs. Here’s our running tally. And here’s a roundup of the five biggest stories in politics this week, including the uproar over a citizenship question on the census. ____ 3. In Ohio, President Trump visited a training center for union workers to promote his infrastructure plan. But he diverted to other topics, saying he might delay a trade deal with South Korea — and promising to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. Above, American service members near Manbij. Two members of the U.S.-led coalition fighting there were killed this week — one American soldier and one British. Mr. Trump ordered the State Department to suspend more than $200 million in funds for stabilization and humanitarian aid, as the administration reassesses its role in the conflict. Idlib Province, the largest remaining rebel-held enclave in Syria, has been flooded with refugees from other areas. As the government wraps up a blistering military campaign in the eastern Ghouta suburbs of Damascus, Idlib is likely to be the next target, and civilians there are trapped. ____ 4. The Israeli military killed 15 Palestinians in confrontations on the border with Gaza. Tens of thousands of Gazans had gathered for what was billed as a peaceful demonstration against Israel’s longstanding blockade and in support of their right to return to their homes in what is now Israel. Gaza’s economy is collapsing and residents — most of whom are refugees or their descendants — face intense restrictions on the movement of goods and people in and out of the territory.  The Israelis said that some demonstrators hurled stones, firebombs and burning tires, and that two gunmen fired at them. They responded with tear gas and gunfire. Some 1,000 people were injured. ____ 5. Stephon Clark, the unarmed man killed by the Sacramento police in his grandmother’s backyard last month, was shot eight times from behind, according to a private autopsy. Above, an image from police footage of the shooting. Protesters in California’s capital have taken to the streets nearly every day since Mr. Clark’s death, demanding that the city’s leadership fire the two officers involved. An activist at a rally outside the city on Saturday was struck by a Sheriff’s Department vehicle and was treated for minor injuries. And the police in Baton Rouge, La., fired the officer who shot Alton Sterling in 2016. The department released new footage of the killing that shows the officer shouting profanities at Mr. Sterling, slamming him into a car and threatening to shoot him in the head. ____ 6. The acquittal by a federal jury of Noor Salman, the widow of the man who gunned down dozens of people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando two years ago, handed federal prosecutors on Friday the rarest of defeats: a loss in a terrorism case. Jurors unanimously rejected government charges that Ms. Salman had helped her husband plan his violent assault in the name of the Islamic State. After our recent coverage of the bombings in Austin, Tex., some readers took issue with our reporting, asking why we didn’t label him a terrorist. Some of our editors and reporters addressed those questions here. ____ 7. We took a look at recent patent applications filed by Amazon and Google. (Above, Amazon’s Alexa Super Bowl ad.)  Tech companies apply for a dizzying number of patents every year, many of which are never used and are years from even being possible. But the recent filings offer a peek at how the companies could seek to mine data from smart speakers and other household devices. For example, a device could start analyzing speech when it hears “love,” “bought” or “dislike” and then send out targeted ads based on that information. ____ 8. Our critic writes that the clock is ticking on the overdue International African American Museum in Charleston, S.C. Above, a rendering. But will $11 million be found to fully fund it? And the 50th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is Wednesday. As we sorted through historical photographs for our coverage, we encountered many people, particularly women and children, who had gone unnamed. Now we want to know: Who were they? We’re hoping you might be able to help us. ____ 9. Tax Day is approaching. The deadline to file is April 17. Our personal finance experts say it’s also an excellent time to give yourself a financial tuneup. They’ve created a weeklong program that walks you through some of the simplest financial tasks you can do to tidy your finances, optimize your spending and make sure you are planning appropriately for the long term. ____ 10. Why are Catholic colleges so good at basketball? While theological explanations are tempting, there is more than just something in the holy water. Our college sports reporter explains.  One of those colleges is Loyola-Chicago, whose fans, above, cheered its long-shot run to the N.C.A.A. tournament’s Final Four. The team lost to Michigan, which will face Villanova in the championship game Monday night. ____ 11.

National,408," Supported by By Patricia Mazzei MIAMI — Gun control legislation is moving at an unusually fast pace in the Florida Capitol following a deadly high school shooting, which has pushed state lawmakers and the governor to act after years of loosening restrictions on firearms. Powerful budget committees in the State House and Senate signed off on a package of bills on Tuesday that would raise the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21 from 18, mandate a three-day waiting period for most gun purchases, and increase funding for school safety measures and access to mental health care. The bills must still be approved by the full House and Senate, and approved by Gov. Rick Scott. Included in the proposals is a contentious, $67 million voluntary program to arm school staff, including teachers, trained by law enforcement to carry concealed weapons on campus. Lawmakers gave preliminary approval to what has become known as the “marshal program” in spite of impassioned pleas by many parents of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students in Parkland, who said educators should not have to take on the role of the police. A similar program already exists in Polk County, in Central Florida. Linda Beigel Schulman, the mother of Scott Beigel, a geography teacher who was killed, told lawmakers her son had become a teacher to teach, not “to be a law enforcement officer.” “If teachers were allowed to carry weapons in school, it could easily cause additional chaos and fatalities,” she said. Republican lawmakers, who are in control of both legislative chambers, said the program would help local sheriffs and police chiefs who do not have enough deputies or officers to assign to schools. State Representative Jose Oliva, the bill sponsor in the House, described the required 132 hours of training for marshals deputized by law enforcement as “extensive.” “Not everyone can possibly agree on a bill this size, on an issue this emotional,” Mr. Oliva, a Republican, said. Mr. Scott, also a Republican, unveiled his own $500 million gun control package in Tallahassee last week and said he opposed arming teachers. But it was unclear if he would accept a proposal from lawmakers to arm school personnel other than teachers, such as athletic coaches who sometimes double as security monitors. He declined to clarify his position in a news conference in the Miami suburb of Doral on Tuesday. “We should be focused on arming law enforcement,” said Mr. Scott, who has proposed helping school districts pay for an armed police officer or sheriff’s deputy at every school, and for every 1,000 students in large high schools. Stoneman Douglas High, with an enrollment of about 3,200, had a single school resource officer, a sheriff’s deputy. Sheriff Scott Israel has said the former deputy, Scot Peterson, stood outside the building and did “nothing” during the shooting, an accusation Mr. Peterson has disputed. Mr. Peterson retired last week after Sheriff Israel placed him under internal investigation. Robert W. Runcie, the superintendent of Broward County Public Schools, said in an interview that he opposed arming teachers. Arming other school personnel might be a “more rational idea,” Mr. Runcie said, but he added that his preference would be adding more law enforcement to school campuses. Mr. Scott also declined to say if he would support the three-day waiting period for gun purchases, which was not part of his proposal to the Legislature. The governor has said a waiting period would not have stopped the shooting suspect at Stoneman Douglas High, Nikolas Cruz, from buying guns because nothing in his background check would have made the purchase unlawful. The governor was accompanied in Doral by Ryan Petty and Andrew Pollack, the fathers of two of the children killed at Stoneman Douglas High, who pledged to return to Tallahassee in the 10 remaining days of the annual legislative session to pressure lawmakers to act. “We are going to get a good bill passed this session,” said Mr. Scott, who is expected to run for a United States Senate seat later this year. In Tallahassee, the National Rifle Association, one of the most influential special interest groups in the state, asked House lawmakers to vote against the legislation. “These provisions are nothing more than an attack on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding people,” said Marion Hammer, the N.R.A.’s Florida lobbyist. Parents, students and teachers from South Florida, the state’s Democratic stronghold, have been a forceful presence in the Capitol since last week, when busloads of Stoneman Douglas High students spent two days lobbying — and protesting — lawmakers, urging them to take more far-reaching action and ban all assault weapons. Mr. Cruz is accused of killing 17 students and staff members with a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle. Democratic legislators, who are far outnumbered in the House and Senate and wield no power over which legislation gets considered, tried repeatedly over three committee hearings on Monday and Tuesday to amend the gun control bills to include an assault weapons ban and other, more stringent policies. Each of their efforts failed.        Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS",2018-02-28,0.001579394,Wednesday
Business,409," By LANDON THOMAS Jr. and STEPHEN GROCERFEB. 26, 2018 You probably are a gun owner. You might not actually possess a gun. But if you have a pension or a 401(k) or an investment in index funds, there’s a good chance that, directly or indirectly, you own shares of one or more gun manufacturers. Like it or not, that means that your financial incentives are at least partly aligned with those of gunmakers. And in general, the more guns they sell, the more money their shareholders — in other words, you — make. The school shooting this month that killed 17 people in Parkland, Fla., has intensified scrutiny on the various ways in which financial institutions and other companies prop up the firearms industry, whether through lending money to gun companies or having marketing partnerships with the National Rifle Association. Many companies have severed their ties to the N.R.A. Blackstone, the private equity giant, recently contacted the hedge funds that it owns, asking about their holdings of gun stocks.  Here is how individual investors, including people whose only investments are through their retirement plans, are financially connected to the gun industry — even if they don’t realize it.  A number of state pension funds own shares in the gun makers. For example, pension funds for public employees in Florida, Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio all have stakes of less than 1 percent in American Outdoor Brands, formerly known as Smith & Wesson, which is the manufacturer of the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle that has been used in a number of recent mass shootings. TIAA, which oversees retirement investments for educators and teachers, has small stakes in American Outdoor Brands and two other publicly traded gun companies. The pension fund for teachers in New York State also has very small positions in the gun companies Sturm Ruger and Vista Outdoor. The investments represent slivers of the pension funds’ overall assets, but they nonetheless are generating debate. New Jersey lawmakers last week moved to cut off investments in gunmakers by the state pension plan. Exchange-traded index funds, which are designed to track the performance of various market indexes, are all the rage these days. They hold the shares of every company in whatever index they’re tracking. These indexes include the Russell 2000 index for small companies and the Standard & Poor’s Aerospace & Defense Select Industry index. That means these investment firms own the stocks, not because they see investment value in them, but because they are part of a broad stock index.      Two of the world’s biggest asset managers, the index giants BlackRock and Vanguard, are now among the top shareholders of three publicly traded gun companies: Sturm Ruger, American Outdoor Brands and Vista Outdoor. BlackRock has an 11 percent stake in American Outdoor Brands, while Vanguard’s stake is 8 percent. For Sturm Ruger, BlackRock owns 17 percent while Vanguard has 9.5 percent. BlackRock said it would be contacting officials at the three publicly traded firearms companies, asking them about how they were responding to the shootings.  Vanguard has taken a more cautious stance. With 20 million clients, the firm said it was unrealistic to cater to such a wide variety of views on pressing social topics. “We believe mutual funds are not optimal agents of social change,” a spokesman said. Vanguard does offer clients a way to screen funds for stocks that they do not want to invest in. While index funds are prominent shareholders of these gun companies, some large mutual funds — in which portfolio managers individually pick stocks — are also substantial owners. One of the world’s biggest fund companies, Capital Group, which oversees $1.6 trillion in assets, has an 8 percent stake in Sturm Ruger. A spokesman for Capital said on Monday that the investment firm “was engaging with gun manufacturers to understand their plans to ensure the safe use of these products.” And the mutual fund giant Fidelity is the top shareholder of Vista Outdoor, with 15 percent of the company. The stake is held largely through Fidelity’s actively managed funds. An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the gun that Smith & Wesson manufactures. It makes AR-15-style rifles, not the AR-15.

Opinion,410," Supported by By Margaret Renkl Ms. Renkl is a contributing opinion writer. NASHVILLE — I didn’t attend the local rally against gun violence on March 24, though more than 10,000 Nashvillians did. The march was planned by Abby Brafman, a Vanderbilt University freshman and 2017 graduate of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. I had out-of-town family visiting, so my husband, a high school English teacher, marched alone. A few minutes after he got to the rally, he texted me a photo he’d taken of himself standing in front of another marcher’s sign. It read, “Am I next?” For just a second, I couldn’t breathe. I had a similar reaction last summer when our oldest son, a new middle school math teacher, took me to see his first classroom. “Just look at all these beautiful windows!” I said. “Not exactly great for an active-shooter situation,” he pointed out. His words turned my heart to ice. Not only am I married to a schoolteacher, and the mother of one, I also have two younger sons in college. Not a single day goes by when I don’t worry about whether they will all be safe in their classrooms. Every parent in this country knows we’re taking a calculated risk when we send our children to school, to a concert, to a movie. The canned statement that used to make us roll our eyes at public events — “Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the location of the exits in the unlikely event of an emergency” — has become our unconscious habit because such emergencies are no longer so unthinkable: Americans are now more likely to be shot to death than to die in a car accident. Everyone is worried about the threat of gun violence, and almost everyone has a clear idea of what to do about it, too. A new Fox News poll — Fox News! — showed strong bipartisan support for at least some forms of gun control: 91 percent of Americans support criminal background checks, 84 percent support mandatory mental health checks, and 60 percent called for an outright ban on assault rifles and semiautomatic weapons. “By a 13-point margin [53 percent to 40 percent], voters consider protecting against gun violence more important than protecting gun rights,” Fox reported. Here in the American South, however, plenty of people still ardently believe our trouble isn’t guns. Americans have “a heart problem,” not a gun problem, the House majority leader of the Tennessee General Assembly said last month. This is an easy conclusion to come to if you’ve grown up in a culture where guns are ubiquitous. My grandfather, a farmer, kept his shotgun hanging on hooks over the coat rack because it was not uncommon for him to need it. My father, a salesman who often had appointments in crime-ridden neighborhoods, carried a handgun on nighttime calls and taught me to shoot it when I was 14. It never crossed their minds that I or anyone else might pick up one of those guns without a very good reason. For my father and my grandfather, a gun was a tool. It was not a toy. They would not have been able to conceive of a world in which civilians could purchase weapons of war, a culture in which gun-entranced suburbanites could host birthday parties where children fire off AR-15s for fun at a homemade range on someone’s family farm. I will never understand this kind of thinking, but that doesn’t mean I don’t understand why a person in certain circumstances might need a gun. In 1982, my grandmother was sitting in a rocking chair just inside the door of a tiny grocery store in rural Alabama when a stranger walked in with a rifle and pointed it at the store owner’s head. My grandmother cried out a warning, and the man turned and shot her instead. While the intruder was busy firing five bullets into my 72-year-old grandmother’s chest and abdomen, the store owner retrieved his own handgun from beneath the counter and killed him. My grandmother was shot by a bad guy with a gun. She lived another 24 years because of the proverbial good guy with a gun. There is no need for polarities here. Most people who don’t own guns understand that some people might truly need to own a gun. Most people who do own guns understand the need to keep other people safe. But our legislators, in thrall to the National Rifle Association, do almost nothing to keep guns away from people who shouldn’t have them, or to keep the most dangerous weapons — those meant to inflict the greatest damage to the most people in the least amount of time — out of the hands of civilians. Tennessee has some of the most permissive gun laws in the country. You don’t need a permit to buy a gun here. You don’t need a license to own one. You aren’t required to register any gun you own. You don’t need a permit to carry a rifle or a shotgun. You aren’t required to pass a background check if you’re buying a gun from a private person. It’s easier to purchase an AR-15 in Tennessee than it is to become a licensed exotic dancer, as two employees of Déjà Vu Showgirls, a Nashville strip club, demonstrated in a recent YouTube video. Tennessee students are caught bringing a gun to school at twice the rate of the national average. The Tennessee General Assembly’s response to this unwelcome trend is to propose arming teachers. If passed, the bill, directed at campuses without a school resource officer, would allow a percentage of teachers to carry a concealed weapon. More than half the members of the Tennessee House of Representatives have co-signed the bill, though it is opposed by state education officials, the teachers’ union, the Tennessee Sheriffs’ Association and Gov. Bill Haslam, a Republican. It’s never a good bet to look for sane behavior from the Tennessee General Assembly, but the opposition to this bill gives me hope. I don’t want my husband to work in a school where teachers are armed. I don’t want my son to work in a school where teachers are armed. All I want is for this state — and this country — to keep anyone else from going to school armed. Judging from the Fox News poll results, this is an opinion nearly all of us share. How remarkable it is, at a time when Americans don’t agree on very much at all, for the response to a terrible problem to be so straightforward and so clear. We don’t need to repeal the Second Amendment. We just need to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them.

Opinion,411,"Opinion We owe it to Dr. King to commemorate the man in full: a radical, ecumenical, antiwar, pro-immigrant and scholarly champion of the poor. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, Ala., for the 1965 march.CreditFrank Dandridge/The LIFE Images Collection, via Getty Images Supported by By Jesse Jackson Mr. Jackson is a former aide to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As the nation prepares to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we should dwell not merely on how Dr. King died but also on how he lived. He mobilized mass action to win a public accommodations bill and the right to vote. He led the Montgomery bus boycott and navigated police terror in Birmingham. He got us over the bloodstained bridge in Selma and survived the rocks and bottles and hatred in Chicago. He globalized our struggle to end the war in Vietnam. How he lived is why he died. As he sought to move beyond desegregation and the right to vote, to focus his work on economic justice, antimilitarism and human rights, the system pushed back hard. In the last months of his life, he was attacked by the government, the press, former allies and the military industrial complex. Even black Democrats turned their backs on him when he challenged the party’s support for the war in Vietnam. A growing number of Americans had a negative view of Dr. King in the final years of his life, according to public opinion polls. A man of peace, he died violently. A man of love, he died hated by many. America loathes marchers but loves martyrs. The bullet in Memphis made Dr. King a martyr for the ages. [To read more commentary on the legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other noteworthy discussions of the day, subscribe to our Opinion Today newsletter.]  We owe it to Dr. King — and to our children and grandchildren — to commemorate the man in full: a radical, ecumenical, antiwar, pro-immigrant and scholarly champion of the poor who spent much more time marching and going to jail for liberation and justice than he ever spent dreaming about it. This is a painful time of the year for me because it is when I am asked to remember the most traumatic night in my life. We had come to Memphis in 1968 to support striking sanitation workers in their fight for better wages and safer working conditions. On the evening of April 4, Dr. King was going to take a group of us, including the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, Andy Young, Hosea Williams and Bernard Lee, to dinner at the home of the Rev. Samuel Billy Kyles, not far from where we were staying, the Lorraine Motel. As we prepared to go, Dr. King cheerfully admonished me, the youngest of the group, for not being suitably dressed for the evening. I wasn’t wearing a tie. “Doc, the only prerequisite for dinner,” I joked back, “is an appetite, not a tie.” We laughed. Dr. King loved to laugh. In his last years, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King was grappling with many issues: workers’ rights, a sprawling protest movement, persistent segregation and poverty. We inherited them all. After dinner we were going to attend a rally for the sanitation workers. I had brought the Operation Breadbasket Orchestra from Chicago to play at the rally. Dr. King, always the hottest ticket in any town, was scheduled to speak. He’d be hard pressed, though, to top the speech he gave the night before at the Mason Temple in Memphis, where he pledged that “we, as a people, will get to the promised land.” It was raining cats and dogs, but the Mason Temple, part of the Church of God in Christ, was nearly full. I was sitting behind Dr. King as he preached from the pulpit. He spoke with such pathos and passion that I saw grown men wiping away tears in the sanctuary. “I’m not worried about anything,” Dr. King told the crowd of about 3,000. “I’m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.” None of us took those words as a premonition. We had heard similar sentiments from him before. Maybe we were in denial. While danger was all around, we never thought the Martin Luther King we knew and loved, admitted to Morehouse College at 15, graduated and ordained at 19, earning a Ph.D. at 26, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize at 35, would be dead at 39. On April 4, the fatal shot rang out just after 6 p.m. as we were about to get into the cars to go to dinner. Dr. King was on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel. I was in the parking lot below. A couple of hours later, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, Dr. King’s successor, gathered us at the Lorraine. By then much of urban America had already moved from shock and sorrow to rage and flames. We had a choice: Surrender to our own anguish and anger, or honor the slain prince of peace by picking up the baton of nonviolent direct action. With deep breaths, the baton firmly in our hands, we went to Resurrection City, the tent city erected by Dr. King’s Poor People’s Campaign in Washington, and continued the work of ending poverty and the war. As the Rev. Joseph Lowery said, we would not let one bullet kill the movement. Dr. King’s spirit has been our moral guidepost for 50 years. That spirit is alive today with the high school students of Parkland, Fla., as they push the country toward sensible gun control. It is alive with the teachers of West Virginia, who have blazed a trail for other workers. It is alive with Black Lives Matter, the Dreamers, Colin Kaepernick and thousands of African-American voters who defied the pundits and sent an Alabama Democrat to the Senate for the first time in a generation. It is alive with the Rev. William Barber as he resurrects Dr. King’s last crusade, the Poor People’s Campaign. Dr. King bequeathed African-Americans the will to resist and the right to vote. Yet while we were marching and winning, the powers of reaction were regrouping, preparing a counterrevolution. Five decades ago, a segregationist governor, George Wallace, peddled hate and division in reaction to the civil rights movement. Today, it is the president himself who is inciting anguish, bigotry and fear. We are in a battle for the soul of America, and it’s not enough to admire Dr. King. To admire him is to reduce him to a mere celebrity. It requires no commitment, no action. Those who value justice and equality must have the will and courage to follow him. They must be ready to sacrifice. The struggle continues. The Rev. Jesse Jackson (@RevJJackson), a former aide to the Rev.

Business,412," By RICHARD FAUSSETMARCH 1, 2018 ATLANTA — Georgia lawmakers approved a bill on Thursday that stripped out a tax break proposal highly coveted by Delta Air Lines — the most stinging punishment that America’s pro-gun forces have leveled so far on one of the many corporations recalibrating their positions on firearms after the Florida high school massacre. The $50 million sales tax exemption on jet fuel that was sought by Delta, one of Georgia’s biggest employers, had been included in a broader tax-relief bill. But this week, a number of Georgia Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, sought to remove the perk as retribution for Delta’s decision to end a promotional discount for members of the National Rifle Association. Delta, in announcing the policy change, said it was trying to remain “neutral” in a national gun debate that has been rekindled by a gunman’s attack at a school in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead. A number of other major American companies, including the car rental company Hertz and MetLife insurance, have also ended relationships with the N.R.A. since the shooting on Feb. 14. On Thursday, the Georgia Senate overwhelmingly approved a version of the bill without the jet-fuel tax break. The House, which had already approved a version of the bill, also approved the change. Both houses are controlled by Republicans.  The legislation now goes to the desk of the Republican governor, Nathan Deal, who has pledged to sign it into law. But Mr. Deal is a supporter of the jet-fuel tax break, and he said he would sign the bill only because it also included a significant reduction in personal and corporate tax rates.  In a sign of the gulf that has opened between gun-rights purists and Republicans with a more pro-business bent, Mr. Deal this week appeared to chastise fellow Republicans who sought to punish Delta, and thus potentially harm Georgia’s business-friendly reputation. “Ours is a welcoming state — the epitome of ‘Southern Hospitality,’” said Mr. Deal, who will leave office because of term limits early next year. “We were not elected to give the late-night talk show hosts fodder for their monologues or to act with the type of immaturity that has caused so many in our society to have a cynical view of politics.” In addition to being one of Georgia’s biggest employers, Delta is the economic engine of Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, the busiest airport in the world and a bragging point in the city’s claim to national and even international stature. The divisions over gun control are stark in Georgia, where Mr. Cagle is among a handful of Republicans who are seeking to be the next governor. They are particularly eager to make an impression among the hard-right conservatives who will have a big voice in the Republican primary in May.      Mr. Cagle, the presumptive front-runner in the governor’s race, presides over the State Senate, and his threat on Monday to kill the tax break was interpreted here as a way to protect his right flank from his Republican rivals. “I think that obviously Delta is free to make any decision that they want to,” Mr. Cagle said during an appearance on “Fox and Friends” this week. He added that Delta “chose to single out the N.R.A. and their membership, law-abiding gun owners, and I don’t think that’s right.” Delta announced on Saturday that it was ending a discount for N.R.A. members traveling to the association’s annual convention. Other Republican candidates for governor were also eager to weigh in in favor of rescinding the tax break. Secretary of State Brian Kemp said lawmakers should reject the perk to airlines and instead focus on creating a sales tax holiday for buyers of guns, ammunition, holsters and safes where guns can be stored. On the floor of the Senate on Thursday, Senator Michael Williams, another Republican candidate for governor, praised his fellow lawmakers for stripping the tax exemption, saying they “stood strong” in the face of pressure from liberals, the media and big business.  Mr. Deal has said he was “committed to finding a pathway forward for the elimination of sales tax on jet fuel, which is nonnegotiable.” But the political reality seems to leave him with few options. Democrats have argued that the attack on Delta, which did not comment Thursday, could harm the ability to attract new businesses, chief among them Amazon. The online retailer named metropolitan Atlanta as one possible location for its new headquarters. “Unfortunately, we’re looking at political gamesmanship, and trying to send ultraconservative messages for the Republican primary,” said Senator Steve Henson, the minority leader. “I think it does not enhance our chances to get Amazon.” A version of this article appears in print on March 2, 2018, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Delta Took a Stand on the N.R.A.; Georgia Lawmakers Want to Make It Pay.

Sports,413," Supported by By Cindy Shmerler KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. — Seth Pearman will not miss the persistent traffic that develops here for two weeks each spring. Pearman, an assistant golf pro at Crandon Golf, a public course next to the Tennis Center at Crandon Park, which houses the Miami Open, has noticed a dip in golf rounds during the tournament as local residents and hotel guests either opt out of the mayhem or suddenly become tennis spectators. “There may be a little bit of groaning about the traffic nightmare,” said Pearman, who has hosted the golf enthusiasts Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Jack Sock, among others, on his course over the last few years. “But we’re not very happy. Most of the residents are really sorry to see the tournament go.” This year’s Miami Open, which ends Sunday, will be the final installment on Key Biscayne, a bucolic barrier island south of Miami Beach. Beginning next year, after 32 years on Key Biscayne, the tournament will migrate northwest to the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, where the Dolphins play. Players, officials and fans will no longer be treated to stunning views as they cross the Rickenbacker Causeway, the gentle aqua cresting of Biscayne Bay on one side and sand beaches of the Atlantic Ocean on the other. “Driving over that bridge, it was always beautiful,” said James Blake, the former top-five player who was named tournament director of the Miami Open late last year. “You can’t complain when that’s your drive to work.” Butch Buchholz and his brother Cliff had the idea in the early 1980s to create a “fifth Grand Slam,” a professional tournament for men and women with equal prize money, to attract the world’s top players to South Florida in early spring. The tournament was forced from its first two homes, in Delray Beach in 1985 and Boca West in 1986. When Buchholz first toured Crandon Park, he saw a garbage dump and a defunct gasoline filling station. It was littered with old tires, refrigerators, even a dog carcass. But Buchholz also saw 5,000 parking spaces across the street and envisioned a tennis mecca that would attract world-class players and international fans. What he did not count on was the opposition of environmentalists who feared the venue would attract rock concerts and tractor pulls. “We didn’t have an easy start,” said Buchholz, 77, who remembers children lying in front of bulldozers to prevent early construction. “I felt like I was in a long five-set match. But I just said, ‘I’ve got to win this thing.’” The long fight wasn’t over, even after the first tournament was held in Crandon Park in 1987. The most vocal opponent to the tournament was Bruce Matheson, a local resident. His family deeded the parkland to Miami-Dade County in the 1940s, but, under the deal, the family maintained control over how the land was used. In recent years, when the tournament wanted to spend $50 million in private funds to make much-needed upgrades to the site, including replacing temporary stadiums with permanent ones, Matheson stymied the deal. A lengthy lawsuit over land use persuaded tournament owners to make a move. “We wanted to stay here,” said Mark Shapiro, the co-president of WME/IMG, which bought the tournament from Buchholz in 1999. “I couldn’t understand how one guy could have so much control over this island.” Just as Shapiro and WME/IMG were entertaining offers to move the tournament north to Orlando or west to California, the Dolphins owner Stephen Ross stepped in, proposing a move to his football complex. Serena Williams, a minority owner of the Dolphins, said she thought Ross was crazy. But she was with Ross on March 19 at a groundbreaking ceremony for a temporary stadium court to be erected on part of the football field. “I grew up in Miami and I believe in Miami and how aspirational it is,” said Ross, 77, who has spent $550 million renovating the stadium since he purchased the Dolphins from Wayne Huizenga in 2008. “To me, this is a sound business deal and should be great for all of South Florida. I love challenges.” Ross added, with a chuckle, “I did it all for my partner, Serena.” The new facility will feature 30 total courts, nine more than at Crandon Park, including double the number of practice courts. A permanent grandstand will be erected, and the players will benefit from expanded dining, gym and locker room facilities. Outside the stadium, a 90-foot-by-40-foot video screen will be installed, allowing fans to relax and dine in the plaza while still catching the on-court action. “We’re going to build a full-on festival,” Shapiro said. “There’s going to be art, music, food vendors, multiple stages for everything. It’s going to be a real taste of Miami.” If one group’s bounty is another’s bummer, there are businesses and individuals who will suffer when the tournament moves. Last year, attendance topped 300,000 for the 10-day event. Employees at Stefano’s Liquor Store, a short distance from the tennis center, likened the tournament’s financial impact on their business to the days leading up to Thanksgiving. Phyllis Briskin has been a tournament volunteer for all 32 years in Miami, first as an usher and now as a co-chairwoman for patron hospitality. “We see the same people once a year and we’re a team,” said Briskin, 79, who may not work at the tournament next year. “There’s just a certain grace that this tournament promotes.” All around the grounds are signs that the end is near. The biggest sellers in the souvenir shop are $40 towels, $35 T-shirts and $10 key chains with a replica of the current stadium. The visors and posters were sold out. Inside a tent previewing next year’s tournament, marketers estimated that half the people were excited for the new site and the other half were lamenting the move. Over the last 32 years, the Crandon Park site has provided some memorable moments. Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati began their careers in Miami. Djokovic and Andre Agassi each won the men’s title six times, while Serena Williams, who lives in South Florida, has captured the women’s championship eight times. The event is the home tournament for the many players who are based in Florida. In 1999, Serena and Venus Williams met in the championship match, the first time sisters contested a top-level final since Maud Watson beat her sister Lilian in the 1884 Wimbledon final. As the song “We Are Family” rang through the public-address system, 18-year-old Venus beat 17-year-old Serena in three sets. Roger Federer and Nadal played the first two of their 38 career meetings in Miami. In 2004, Nadal, then 17, stunned Federer, the new world No. 1, in straight sets in the third round. In the final a year later, Federer avenged the loss, rebounding from two sets down and 1-4 in the third to win in five sets over 3 hours 42 minutes. In 1989, Thomas Muster, the Austrian star, was hit by a drunken driver as he was loading bags into the trunk of his car hours after his semifinal win. He tore ligaments in his knee and was forced to default the final against Ivan Lendl. Muster came back eight years later to capture the title over Sergi Bruguera. In 1994, Pete Sampras got food poisoning on the eve of his final with Agassi. He tried to default, but Agassi would not let him, offering to postpone the match for several hours to give Sampras time to recover. Sampras went on to defeat Agassi in three sets. Perhaps the most emotional moment in tournament history occurred last weekend when members of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School tennis teams joined top players, including Nick Kyrgios, Garbiñe Muguruza, Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan, in a stadium court ceremony. The school, where 17 people were killed in a shooting on Feb. 14, is 42 miles northwest of Key Biscayne. The athletes wore T-shirts with the slogan #mdstrong that were sold on site, earning more than $30,000 for the Stoneman Douglas Victims’ Fund. Federer, who has competed in Miami for 17 years, winning the title in 2005, 2006 and 2017, said, “I hope we look back 30 years from now and say, ‘Thank God we made this move.’”        Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS",2018-03-30,0.001562261,Friday
NYTNow,414," By KAREN ZRAICK and SANDRA STEVENSONFEB. 27, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Jared Kushner, the president’s adviser and son-in-law, has been downgraded. He’s been stripped of his top-secret security clearance. (Now he’s only privy to more ordinary secrets.) The move was part of an overhaul by the White House chief of staff, John Kelly. The question now is whether Mr. Kushner, above center, will be able to keep his portfolio, which includes negotiations with Israel and the Palestinians. ____ 2. The massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., has thrust gun rights into the midterm campaign. The issue is scrambling traditional game plans in both parties as the debate shifts toward action on firearms restrictions.  In Georgia, the lieutenant governor threatened to kill a proposed tax cut for Delta Air Lines after the company eliminated a discount program for the N.R.A.  How did law enforcement officials miss so many red flags about the Florida suspect? We delved into that question on “The Daily.” ____ 3. North Korea has been shipping supplies to the Syrian government that could be used in the production of chemical weapons, according to U.N. experts. We reviewed an unreleased report written by a panel assessing the North’s compliance with U.N. sanctions. It cites years of North Korean shipments of necessary components to Syria and the presence of North Korean technicians at Syrian chemical weapons facilities. Fighting persisted in eastern Ghouta, a rebel-held enclave near Damascus, above, despite a Russian declaration of a cease-fire. ____ 4. With China scrapping term limits, President Xi Jinping has new authority to pursue his drive to make the country a dominant global power. Chinese analysts see the risk of a new Cold War. Above, Mr. Xi’s image on a decorative plate — in back of a figurine of Mao — in a souvenir shop in Beijing. Mr. Xi has ordered the Chinese military to counter the Pentagon with its own modernization in air, sea, space and cyber weapons, partly in response to President Trump’s plans to revitalize American nuclear forces. ____ 5. The bidding war could be stunning. Comcast bid $31 billion for the British satellite broadcaster Sky. But Sky is an important part of Disney’s $52 billion plan to buy a significant portion of 21st Century Fox.  So, as broadcast and media giants retool in the rapidly changing global marketplace, either 21st Century Fox will have to pay more for the parts of Sky it doesn’t own — or Disney will lose a valuable international property to Comcast. ____ 6. In the Seattle area, where homelessness is a dire problem, tent cities have been allowed to become part of the landscape. Seattle Pacific University, above, is trying a more temporary approach. It has let a roving encampment set up on campus three times, for 90 days each. Both sides of the camp/campus line say the experience changed them — but they’d all like a better solution. ____ 7. Our 52 Places Traveler, Jada Yuan, went to Montgomery, Ala., where she visited key historical sites of the civil rights movement. Ms. Yuan, you may remember, is at the start of a truly plum assignment, visiting all of the destinations on the Travel desk’s annual list of “52 Places to Go.” “I was eager to find out why the city had snagged the No. 49 slot,” she wrote of Montgomery. “By the end of four days, I’d come to believe it should have ranked higher.” ____ 8. Bless you if you sneeze into your elbow. Public health officials say that’s far preferable. Germs that instead land on your hands can easily be spread to door knobs, elevator buttons and other high-traffic surfaces.  Forgive your co-workers (or yourself) if you didn’t know. The C.D.C. guidance has become official only in the last 10 to 15 years. ____ 9. How come scientists love to study dogs — but ignore cats? Our reporter — investigating his own apparent pro-dog bias — found that the nature of dogs really does get more scientific attention. (Above, Turkish Van cats taking part in a study.) “The research has lagged behind in cats,” a geneticist told us. “I think they’re taken less seriously than dogs.” ____ 10. Finally, Stephen Colbert reacted with disbelief to President Trump’s statement that he would have run into a Florida high school during a shooting — even if he was unarmed. “Look, sir, we already know how you react to combat situations,” he said. “You got five deferments from Vietnam. What are you gonna do, run in there and stab ’em with your bone spurs?” Have a great night. ____ Get a nightly rundown of the day’s top stories, delivered to your inbox every Monday through Friday.

NYTNow,415," By DAN LEVINMARCH 30, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning.  Russia retaliates, migrants in limbo and celebrating Passover in Spain. Here’s the latest: • Russia hits back. The Kremlin announced that it would expel 150 Western diplomats and close the American Consulate in St. Petersburg, above, as tit-for-tat retaliation continues over a nerve-agent attack on British soil that London and its allies have attributed to Moscow. Britain said it would review the cases of 700 wealthy Russians who were granted visas largely because they could invest millions of dollars. It also signaled an openness to blocking the Russian government from British financial markets. The moves came on a day of good news in the poisoning attack. Yulia Skripal, who was attacked with her father, Sergei Skripal, “is no longer in critical condition.” _____ • “Why am I here?”  Two years after the E.U. and Turkey struck a deal to halt the flow of asylum seekers, thousands remain stranded on the Greek island of Lesbos.  One of our reporters visited a holding camp on the island, above, where she found miserable conditions and growing despair among those unable to move on, yet unwilling to go home.  Stuck in limbo, their plight reflects the enduring humanitarian toll of the migration crisis, which is expected to grow again as winter fades. _____ • Jeremy Corbyn, the British Labour Party’s most left-wing leader in decades, has galvanized supporters eager to get rid of the country’s Conservative government. But a mounting crisis over accusations of anti-Semitism has recharged a bitter argument about his leadership and forced many liberal British Jews to question whether they still have a political home in the party. _____ • It’s a date. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea agreed to meet for the first time on April 27. They’ll get together in the truce village of Panmunjom at Peace House, above, meaning that Mr. Kim would become the first leader from the North to set foot in the South since the Korean War. Mr. Kim has signaled that he would meet with President Trump, though no date has been set. _____ • In Denmark, breaking up is about to get … slower. A push to digitalize official services makes it easy for Danes to view public records and even get divorced online.  Maybe too easy, at least in a country with one of Europe’s highest divorce rates.

The N.C.A.A. tournament, also known as the Big Dance, is among the most cherished rites of American sports. About 350 colleges and universities field teams in the top division, compared with 65 in football. At the end of the regular season, 68 teams move on to a knockout tournament. The first men’s tournament was held in 1939, and for more than a decade only eight teams were invited. The women’s tourney started in 1982. The moniker “March Madness” became part of pop vernacular in the mid-1980s, stemming from the David-versus-Goliath upsets that always shock players, coaches, fans and bookmakers. The odds of picking a perfect bracket are 1 in 9.2 quintillion. Even so, it’s almost a duty of U.S. citizenship to fill out a tournament bracket. (Last year, ESPN.com reported that some 70 million brackets were filled out and $10.4 billion was wagered.) The men’s Final Four consists of Kansas, Michigan Villanova and Loyola-Chicago, a team that entered as a 300-to-1 underdog and wasn’t supposed to win its first game. In the women’s tournament, Connecticut, Louisville, Mississippi State and Notre Dame are the last teams standing.

Washington,416," By ADAM LIPTAKFEB. 28, 2018 WASHINGTON — Minnesota prohibits people at polling places from wearing T-shirts, hats and buttons that express political views. In a First Amendment challenge to the state’s law on Wednesday, the Supreme Court explored what kinds of apparel the law bars as the justices considered how to balance free speech rights with civility at the voting booth. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. peppered a lawyer for the state with hard questions during a lively argument. A T-shirt bearing a rainbow flag? “It would be permitted,” said the lawyer, Daniel Rogan, “unless there was an issue on the ballot that related somehow to gay rights.” A T-shirt saying “Parkland Strong,” referring to the Florida school shooting? That would be O.K., Mr. Rogan said.  A T-shirt bearing the logo of the National Rifle Association? That would not be acceptable “today in Minnesota,” Mr. Rogan said.  One reproducing the text of the Second Amendment? “I think that that could be viewed as political,” Mr. Rogan said. One reproducing the text of the First Amendment? “It would be allowed,” Mr. Rogan said. One saying “All lives matter”? “That could be perceived as political,” Mr. Rogan said. One saying #MeToo? “If that was an issue in elections in that polling place, that would be political,” Mr. Rogan said. After hearing all of this, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch said he was uneasy about a law that “would forbid people from wearing certain portions of the Bill of Rights into a polling place but not other portions of the Bill of Rights.” The case, Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky, No. 16-1435, presented the court with unusually difficult line-drawing challenges. But several of the more liberal justices, joined at times by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, said that maintaining the decorum and dignity of polling places could justify substantial restrictions on free speech rights. “You should be able to have a time for some quiet reflection, or to do that important civic obligation in peace and quiet, without being bombarded by another campaign display,” Chief Justice Roberts said. J. David Breemer, a lawyer for the challengers, disagreed. “Polling places are not pristine retreats from the real world,” he said.  But Justice Kennedy seemed to accept that polling places may require special First Amendment rules. “Why should there be any speech there at all?” he asked. “You’re there to vote.”      Minnesota’s law, similar to ones in about nine other states, is quite broad. It says that “a political badge, political button or other political insignia may not be worn at or about a polling place on primary or Election Day.” The case started when members of the Minnesota Voters Alliance, which says it works to ensure “election integrity,” turned up at Minnesota polling places wearing T-shirts bearing Tea Party logos and buttons saying “Please I.D. Me.” They were told to cover the messages and were allowed to vote even if they refused. But they risked prosecution for disobeying poll workers’ orders. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the “Please I.D. Me” buttons were particularly objectionable, adding that they conveyed “a highly charged political message” that a lower court had found “was intended to intimidate people to leave the polling booth.” The Supreme Court case was not centered on the particular items the challengers wanted to wear. It was instead a general challenge to the law, saying it is overly broad and vague even if the particular items could constitutionally be barred. Mr. Breemer, representing the challengers, seemed to frustrate the justices with his refusal to say exactly where he would draw the line. “We’re going to have to write an opinion on this,” Justice Kennedy told him. “You say: ‘Well, I don’t know. I don’t know.’ ” In a 1992 decision, Burson v. Freeman, the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law that created a 100-foot buffer zone around polling places barring electioneering. But that law was aimed at traditional campaign signs and posters, not apparel bearing more general messages.  Mr. Breemer said the distinction mattered, adding that passive messages displayed on clothing and the like should be treated differently from signs soliciting votes for particular candidates. Justice Gorsuch appeared unpersuaded. “A T-shirt, you say, is passive,” he said. “What if it were instead a sign on my head, you know, flashing lights?” “How are we supposed to police the line you’re suggesting?” Justice Gorsuch asked. Justice Alito pressed Mr. Rogan, the state’s lawyer, about whether poll workers could be trusted to make on-the-spot judgments about what apparel qualifies as political. “It’s an invitation for arbitrary enforcement and enforcement that’s not evenhanded,” he said. “And I have no idea where the line lies.” Justice Kennedy said that disputes at polling places about what could be worn would do more damage to decorum than just letting people express themselves. “It seems to me that’s more disruptive than wearing the shirt,” he said.

Metro,417," By LISA W. FODERAROAPRIL 16, 2018 CALLICOON, N.Y. — Across New York’s Hudson Valley and points west, a sprawling demographic and cultural hodgepodge has emerged as a key battleground for the Democratic Party in its hope to flip the House of Representatives in November’s midterm elections. More than $6 million has already poured into the race for the 19th Congressional District from Democratic donors. The only problem is that the Democrats have yet to settle on a candidate, and there are seven contenders, including two lawyers, a businessman and a former C.I.A. official. “I’m staying neutral,” said Keith Kanaga, chairman of the Columbia County Democratic Committee. “Part of the thing we are all grappling with is that we like them all. But who will the general voter like the best? That’s turning out to be a hard question to answer. They are all attractive in different ways.” There are not many districts that run more down the middle than the 19th District, which encompasses the Catskills and largely rural Otsego and Schoharie counties as well as much of the Hudson Valley. There are 141,000 registered Democrats, 138,000 Republicans and 115,000 independents.  Voters here favored President Barack Obama in 2012, but then sided with Donald J. Trump in 2016. A Democrat held a House seat here as recently in 2010, but the last four elections have gone to Republicans, most recently John J. Faso, in 2016. Mr. Faso, who is running for re-election, is one of six Republican House members in New York being targeted by the Democratic Party; among them, he may have the largest bull’s-eye on his back.  Mr. Faso was one of the architects of a plan that would have forced New York State to pick up the counties’ share of Medicaid financing — a proposal that was contained in an amendment to both the House and Senate versions of bills to repeal the Affordable Care Act, legislation that ultimately failed. Only one of Mr. Faso’s Democratic challengers can claim government experience in New York; that candidate, Gareth Rhodes, who worked for the Cuomo administration, has sought to differentiate himself in a shoe-leather sort of way — or, more accurately, a tire-tread way. Mr. Rhodes, 29, has set out to visit all 163 towns in a congressional district larger than Connecticut and Delaware combined, buying a Winnebago for the tour of an area that contains pristine horse farms and rod-and-gun clubs, art galleries and monster-truck shows. Along with the pledge to visit every town is another campaign gimmick that Mr. Rhodes hopes will resonate in a district where the median household income is about $55,000. Wherever he goes, he asks for a donation of $19 (for the 19th District), an amount that he believes demonstrates support without straining wallets. Mr. Rhodes is toward the back of the fund-raising pack, however. Occupying the lead in that race, according to campaign filings through the end of March, are Antonio Delgado, a former Rhodes scholar who lives in Rhinebeck and practices law in New York City, with $1.9 million, and Brian Flynn, an entrepreneur who became an activist after his brother was killed aboard Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988, with $1.4 million. Patrick Ryan, a Kingston native, Iraq War veteran and small-business owner, had raised $1.3 million; David Clegg, a trial lawyer from Woodstock and member of several social-justice organizations, $650,000; and Jeff Beals, also of Woodstock, a high school teacher who was a C.I.A. intelligence officer and later a diplomat, $261,000. Mr. Rhodes’s year-end total was $450,000; his current total of $685,000, he said, includes the highest portion of small donations.  The lone woman in the race, Erin Collier of Cooperstown, who worked as an agricultural economist under President Obama, was a late entrant, so her fund-raising totals were not reflected in the last filing with the Federal Election Commission. Steven Greenberg, a pollster with the Siena College Research Institute, said that once the Democratic candidate emerged in the June 26 primary, additional money would pour in. “This is a district that is targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as one they would like to pick up, and it’s one of the key seats that the Republican National Committee wants to defend,” he said. “Both have made it clear that this will be a battleground district this fall.” For his part, Mr. Faso defends his record as a freshman congressman, saying he has helped struggling dairy farmers in his district and secured projects and funding that are critical, if not sexy. He cited a hospital generator in Sullivan County and grants for sewer systems, as well as help he provided to individual constituents. “We fixed a disability claim for a veteran that was pending for 30 years,” he said. As for the issue over which he and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo have butted heads, the plan that would have forced the state to pick up counties’ share of Medicaid, Mr. Faso said he stood by the now-defunct legislation. “The 57 counties outside of New York City spend more on Medicaid costs than the 49 other states combined,” he said. “This is a gigantic problem, which Governor Cuomo prefers not to address.” Mr. Faso has tried to strike a balance in his stance on President Trump. And he has sought bipartisan solutions to problems through the House’s Problem Solvers Caucus, which is made up of two dozen Democrats and an equal number of Republicans. “I’ve said clearly when I agree and when I disagree with the president,” he allowed. “These are contentious and polarized times and I’ve tried to be a voice of reason.” Most recently, in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., Mr. Faso embraced such gun-control measures as tightening background checks, raising the age to buy a semiautomatic rifle and banning bump stocks.      Mr. Rhodes’s position on gun control is significantly tougher than that of Mr. Faso. At a recent meet-and-greet event at a home in this town in northwestern Sullivan County, he laid out a set of measures, including a ban on assault-style weapons like the AR-15, universal background checks and laws on gun storage and safety.  Mr. Rhodes grew up working on a farm in Ulster County that belonged to the Bruderhof religious community, where, he said, a “gun was a considered a tool, just like a tractor.” So he understands the culture protective of the Second Amendment, he said. “Here we are in Sullivan County, with 75,000 people and 25,000 pistol permits,” he said. “There are reasons people own firearms that go beyond hunting. I’m someone who is comfortable talking to sportsmen’s associations and rod-and-gun clubs.” As a press aide to Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Rhodes crisscrossed the Hudson Valley in his first job after college. He left government in 2015 to enroll in Harvard Law School, and with only one semester left before graduating, Mr. Rhodes stepped away from Cambridge to run for Congress. NEW YORK Buffalo 19th Congressional District Albany New York City APRIL 16, 2018 It remains to be seen whether his association with the Cuomo administration will help or hurt his candidacy. Four years ago, Mr. Cuomo took a beating in the district, drawing fewer votes than Zephyr Teachout in the Democratic primary and than Rob Astorino in the general election. (In 2016, Ms. Teachout unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Faso.) Still, Mr. Rhodes trumpets his work for Mr. Cuomo, highlighting the agenda he helped promote. “I was part of the administration that said no to fracking, and I’m proud to be from a state that did that,” he said to scattered applause at a recent campaign event here. One resident asked Mr. Rhodes how his policies differed from those of his fellow Democratic challengers. Before he could finish his response, however, another attendee, Bruce Ferguson, who was a leader in the fight against fracking, piped up: “Electability, electability, electability.” “Your work ethic is second to none,” Mr. Ferguson, a leader of a group called Sullivan Alliance for Sustainable Development, said to Mr. Rhodes. “You are up every morning and hitting the road. It’s the kind of energy we need to win a very tough race.” Regardless of voter turnout in November, Mr. Faso will have the advantage of incumbency, not to mention a campaign war chest — currently at $1.7 million — that he can largely conserve until the general election draws closer, unlike his Democratic counterparts still seeking their party’s nod. Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at New Paltz, counts Mr. Faso as a longtime friend. A lifelong Republican, Professor Benjamin said he was so disturbed by President Trump’s record that he recently dropped his enrollment in the party. Yet he still plans to vote for Mr. Faso. “He’s deeply experienced, smart and wonky and totally informed on a range of issues,” he said. Mr. Rhodes is nonetheless optimistic that voters will turn against Mr. Faso on issues ranging from health care to gun control, and expects that his own exhaustive tour of the district will win him votes. “This district is enormous: 7,900 square miles,” he told the small audience here. “I’m doing town-hall meetings. I’m going to diners, just listening. To me, this is important both to win the race, but also to take the voice of this community to Washington.” Follow Lisa W. Foderaro on Twitter: @lisanyt.

Opinion,418," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By A. Odysseus Patrick SYDNEY, Australia — The rampage at a high school in Parkland, Fla., has prompted calls for an Australian-style response, as have previous massacres in the United States. Australia introduced a comprehensive gun control regime after a massacre in Tasmania 22 years ago, and mass shootings here dropped to zero. Some experts regard it as the most effective gun control system in the world. But the Australian model won’t work in the United States. Here’s why: We Australians have a profoundly different relationship with weapons. Americans love guns. We’re scared of them. This difference explains why a conservative prime minister was able to confiscate some 650,000 privately owned firearms and ban semiautomatic weapons without a single reported act of violence. That wasn’t all. Twenty-eight-day waiting times were introduced for firearm purchases. All gun buyers were required to have a genuine reason to qualify for a license (self-protection didn’t count). A national gun registry was created. Australians, on the whole, were happy to give up their guns and accept the new restrictions. They understood that semiautomatic guns, which reload themselves each time fired, increase exponentially the lethality of a firearm. No mass gun rights movement existed to articulate an opposing view. The sport-shooting organizations, which might have fought the changes, were apolitical. The elected representatives of rural communities where guns were most common were co-opted by the government’s urban-dominated leadership. When explaining how Australia accomplished such a big change so quickly, analysts and commentators home in on the traumatic effect of what is known as the Port Arthur Massacre, in which 35 people were shot dead in and near a historic township in Tasmania. “It took one massacre,” a headline in The Guardian said on the 20th anniversary of the deaths. Deeper reasons explain why worse mass killings in the United States don’t trigger similar changes in gun laws. Australians’ and Americans’ different relationship with firearms stems from the role that armed struggle played in their histories. In Australia, we didn’t have one. We never had a revolution. We never fought foreign troops on our soil. There was no antipodean civil war. From the moment the First Fleet arrived in Botany Bay in 1788 in what is now Sydney, security was provided by the British Army. The indigenous population was displaced by force of arms, disease and appropriation of land, crimes for which many Australians still feel guilty. Prosperity, universal health care and unemployment benefits helped suppress crime. The few race riots that took place didn’t involve shooting. Australia’s founding fathers, attempting to unify six colonies, didn’t mention guns in the Constitution. They weren’t worried about government oppression. Over time, Australians came to view firearms with suspicion. Most Australians have never held one. Recreational shooting is regarded as a fringe sport. Unlike many Americans, who might proudly show off their latest pistol or rifle, Australians who own and enjoy using firearms, like me, try to be discreet. After working in the same office for almost a decade, I’ve never admitted to colleagues that I enjoy hunting, although I’m always happy to discuss my last beach vacation. My preteen children don’t know that I own a small-caliber hunting rifle. Only a few close friends have seen it. I am legally obliged to store the rifle in a gun safe. Bullets must be kept in a separate compartment. A police officer visited my home to ensure that the safe was bolted into my garage’s brick wall. I gave a vague answer when a neighbor asked why there was a patrol car in the driveway. This ingrown cultural hostility toward firearms explains why there was no fear and only isolated anger at the government, even among owners, when it took away people’s guns in 1996. In the United States, even if the political opposition could be overcome, such widespread appropriation of private property and limits on personal liberties would most likely be met with fierce, even physical, resistance. Australian political leaders are rightly proud of our tight gun laws, which have also reduced criminal homicides and suicides. But it is unfair to grieving and distressed Americans to pretend that the Australian solution to mass shootings can be carried out in the United States. A homegrown plan is needed. A.

Travel,419," Supported by The Caribbean Now Evenings can be lively in Cruz Bay and the beaches are still inviting. But major resorts are closed and cleanup efforts continue. By Mireya Navarro Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated islands in the Caribbean last September. Six months later, how are they recovering? To find out, writers for Travel spent time in Vieques, St. Martin, St. John (below), Dominica and San Juan, P.R.   The ruins of a windmill that crushed stalks of cane in the 19th century was off-limits, a red sign warning of its “unsafe condition.” So were many of the other spots of interest along the trail of the Annaberg Sugar Plantation in St. John in the United States Virgin Islands after Hurricanes Irma and Maria swept through the Caribbean six months ago.   St. John suffered major damage to its hotel and housing stock, charter boat business, beach facilities and the national parkland that extends over about 60 percent of the island. It lost its clinic and its only public school buildings.  Now visitors are trying to look past uprooted trees and roofless buildings to focus on the natural beauty that has been St. John’s main draw.  At the Annaberg ruins in the Virgin Islands National Park, one sight remained untouched: the ocean view with a cluster of British Virgin Islands in the distance, looking as majestic as an oil painting.     “There’s two ways to look at it,” said Cathy Malley, 68, of New Milford, Conn., who has been coming to St. John for three decades with her husband Art. “Some people may say, ‘What a mess.’ On the other hand, you still have the beautiful views and the beautiful beaches.” Loyal visitors like the Malleys are still coming but tourism is down — by more than half for this time of the year, local business owners said. The island’s two largest resorts, Caneel Bay and the Westin St. John Resort Villas, remain closed, most likely through 2018, affecting both tourism and jobs. During a visit in early March, the evening scene was lively in Cruz Bay, the town on the western side where restaurants and shops are concentrated. The streets were filled with people and laughter, and music spilled over from restaurants and bars, including Morgan’s Mango, which had just reopened after the hurricane. Mongoose Junction, the stone and mahogany shopping center with about 30 stores and restaurants, was up and running. But there weren’t the usual jam-packed crowds for this time of the year, some business owners noted, and many stores were closing early. “We just don’t have the same business and some businesses don’t have the employees,” said Beverly Lockett, who is in charge of customer service at the jewelry store Caravan Gallery and serves as president of the Mongoose Junction Merchants Association.  The decline in visitors was most glaring during the day, when there was no trouble getting a parking spot at the most popular beaches. The island’s beaches have reopened but they are not equally ready to welcome guests. Salt Pond Bay beach on the southeastern shore of the island, with an actual salt pond a short hike away, looked picturesque on a Tuesday morning, with beachgoers bobbing among catamarans in the water or lying on the sand and sitting under umbrellas. A protected cove, its waters were calm even as the nor’easter dumping snow in the United States was roiling the Caribbean with huge waves.  By contrast, Cinnamon Bay, a drive west along the northern shore, had drawn only a handful of surfers to its waters. One of St. John’s most popular beaches, Cinnamon Bay suffered extensive damage to its campgrounds, cottages, concessions and bathrooms, and only chunks of masonry walls remained of the Cinnamon Bay Archaeology Museum, which had been housed in a structure dating back centuries. (The contents of the museum had been removed for hurricane season.)  There had been no cleanup of the wreckage.  The amenities at another popular beach, Trunk Bay, were in better shape although bathroom facilities were closed, replaced by portable ones, and there was no running water for showers. Sitting in the picnic area, Cathy and Art Malley, the visitors from Connecticut, said newcomers may not notice the things they missed, like the palm trees and sea grapes that they said used to frame the beach and provide shade.  On the plus side, some visitors noticed that several beaches were wider. The snorkeling was still good, with plenty of fish but some damage to reefs. “You saw some broken coral,” said Donna Siefert of West Chicago, Ill., who snorkeled in several beaches with her husband, Ernie. “The coral was covered with this dust.” The Sieferts, who have been returning to St. John since their first visit in 1995, had their reservation for one of the cottages at Cinnamon Bay canceled because of the damage. They stayed in a condo complex far from the water and the sound of surf but were glad they didn’t change their plans.  “It’s still a beautiful island,” Mrs. Siefert said.  Many residents said they were thrilled with the pace of recovery given the initial damage from back-to-back hurricanes. They remember the impassable roads, the trees snapped in half, the sunken boats and the widespread gutting of houses and other buildings. “The park was devastated,” said Joe Kessler, the president of Friends of Virgin Islands National Park.  “There was a tremendous amount of tree fall. The hillsides of the park resembled Mount St. Helens after the eruptions.” The park, which has 27 trails and more than 15 beaches, reopened in December after a cleanup and now, Mr. Kessler said, the harder task of repairing buildings, restoring trails and other recovery work continues.  Beverly Nicholson-Doty, the Virgin Islands commissioner of tourism, said both power and water have been restored to 99 percent of the territory. She estimated tourism was more than 60 percent down, largely because of a significantly reduced hotel inventory.  Flights are also at about half the pre-hurricane levels, officials said, but some airlines have announced more flight restorations and additions in the coming months. “Every day gets a little better and better,” she said. St. John benefited from some early intervention from famous part-time residents like Thomas F. Secunda, a co-founder of Bloomberg L.P., and Kenny Chesney, the country music singer. Both mobilized help, with Bloomberg Philanthropies paying experts on power restoration and other consultants to expedite recovery in St. John and the rest of the territory.  The organizations, including Mr. Chesney’s Love for Love City Foundation,  remain active in rebuilding efforts along with volunteer groups like All Hands and Hearts — Smart Response, which has about two dozen volunteers helping owners, all uninsured, with debris removal. The volunteers have focused in the Coral Bay area, which took Hurricane Irma’s direct furious punch — these days parts of it have the look of a busy construction site with debris transfer areas and trucks carrying new, sturdier fiberglass power poles for installation.    At one property, nine volunteers in purple shirts were helping owner Eugene Foy, 55, remove water-damaged and moldy materials from three small wood and Sheetrock structures that had lost walls and roofs or portions of them.  Many windows were broken and most of the contents were exposed. In one roofless bedroom, the open bottom drawer of a dresser held rubble. In the kitchen, a vine from the outside had found its way over to the sink.  Mr. Foy’s wife had moved with relatives in St. Thomas, he said, and so had the nephew who lived with them and had found work in recovery efforts. Mr. Foy, a construction worker, said: “I tried to do a little bit but I need the help. I appreciate it so much.  It’ll take some years.” One volunteer, Leslie Zengler, 54, of Portage, Ind., said she had once been a visitor. Twenty years ago, she had taken the ferry to St. John from St. Thomas for the day, on Thanksgiving Day, and she, her husband and friends had eaten turkey sandwiches on the beach.  Now she found “a lot of devastation,” she said, “but a lot of businesses are open and the greenery is coming back.” The volunteers have taken over the human resources building and employee cafeteria at the Caneel Bay resort, sleeping in cots, bunk beds and outside in tents. Caneel Bay has also made room for National Park Service and federal emergency employees in 30 still-habitable rooms. But the 166-room luxury resort, spread over 170 acres of federal parkland and built by Laurance Rockefeller in the 1950s, has yet to start its own repairs. The owner, Equis Financial Group’s CBI Acquisitions LLC, expects to spend $100 million rebuilding but is first seeking a 60-year extension on its rental agreement with the federal government for use of the site, Patrick Kidd, the resort’s director of marketing, said. The current 40-year agreement expires in 2023. “The owners need to know that they’ll have a financial benefit from making that investment,” Mr. Kidd said.  The U.S. Virgin Islands representative in Congress, Stacey Plaskett, has introduced a bill authorizing the 60-year extension, noting Caneel Bay, with about 400 workers, is St. John’s largest employer.   Some hotels suffered only minor damage and never closed. David Guidi, the co-owner of Hotel Cruz Bay, where I stayed during my visit, said that he first housed local families in his 11 rooms, then relief workers. From his second-floor porch, I could see fallen trees, boarded-up houses and the mangled roof of the kindergarten-to-eighth grade Julius E. Sprauve School, so badly damaged that government officials are planning to have it rebuilt at another location.   Only now has Mr. Guidi started “transitioning to tourists.” “Workers don’t spend as much,” he said. “Tourists drink until they can’t see anymore.” But hotel owners and managers say visitors are overwhelmingly return guests, mostly from the northeastern United States, and it is very much uncertain when exactly tourism will bounce back in full.  A short walk up the street from Mr. Guidi’s hotel, the 60-room Gallows Point Resort looked unscathed but was only 58 percent filled, the general manager Akhil Deshwal said. Gallows Point has a newly rebuilt restaurant and is still repairing a handful of rooms. Many water activities — sunset sailing, island hopping — have been severely curtailed because a large number of charter boats were destroyed. But the hotel managed to keep most of its landscape in the hurricane winds; spread over five acres overlooking Cruz Bay and the Caribbean Sea, it seemed to have its bougainvillea and tropical vibe back. Still, some first-time visitors felt the island had a long way to go. Helen and Ted Roberts, of Boston, said they made it to St. John at the end of a weeklong catamaran trip through the Caribbean. They had already sampled five beaches. “I felt a little sad,” Mrs. Roberts, 64, said. “Just watching them put up electric poles. That’s going to take a long time.” Mr. Roberts, 69, said: “In fairness it has to be compared with other Caribbean places like Aruba and Cayman. As it is right now, St. John isn’t as good as those places.” Just like in the rest of the Caribbean struck by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the U.S. Virgin Islands for a while were not suitable even for some of their own residents. St. John shed some of its own population of about 4,500 after the hurricanes as people left for the States looking for jobs and schools.  Ms. Nicholson-Doty said that the Virgin Islands, including St. Thomas and St. Croix, temporarily lost about 10 percent of its population but that many have been returning.  Many of those who never left expressed optimism that a complete recovery was not too far away. As Mr. Foy, the Coral Bay resident, put it: “The papaya trees are already springing up.”   Mireya Navarro, a former reporter for The New York Times, is the author of the memoir “Stepdog.”     Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS",2018-03-19,0.0015415739,Monday

                FEB. 23, 2018 Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. At a town hall meeting on Wednesday night, Senator Marco Rubio was grilled over gun control by students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 people last week. Trevor Noah highlighted the moment when a student asked the senator to promise he wouldn’t take any more campaign contributions from the National Rifle Association. Rubio demurred. “That was so awkward for Marco Rubio. He looked like a dad trying to explain to his son why he cheated on his mom. He was like, ‘You see, Cameron, sometimes a politician has needs. And when the N.R.A. opens their wallet, it’s so hard to resist. Heh, heh. One day you’ll understand, kid.’” — TREVOR NOAH Jimmy Kimmel summed up that particular exchange succinctly. “And at that moment, Marco Rubio realized he had lost the high school debate 30 years after graduating high school.” — JIMMY KIMMEL Rubio won applause, not jeers, when he told the crowd he would reconsider his opposition to limits on the size of magazine clips. That gave Noah an idea. “I’m not going to lie, I’m surprised that these heckling teenagers got Rubio to change his mind. Maybe bullying isn’t that bad after all. In fact, maybe that’s how you get the rest of America’s lawmakers to do anything: Move the floor of Congress to the middle of a coliseum.” — TREVOR NOAH Some news commentators said that Rubio should receive credit for showing up to the town hall, regardless of the views he espoused there. Stephen Colbert sees it differently. “O.K., here’s the thing: Just showing up isn’t that impressive. He works for those people. If your boss calls you into their office, you can’t say, ‘Yes, I hit a customer; yes, I turned the break room into a sex dungeon; and I’m currently very high. But I showed up, even though I knew you’d be mad! I should get some credit for that. Do you want to get high?’” — STEPHEN COLBERT  Oprah Winfrey was on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Thursday, and Kimmel asked what it felt like on Sunday when President Trump called her “insecure” on Twitter. Winfrey told Kimmel that she didn’t consider herself an insecure person.  When he asked if she had ever considered responding to Trump on Twitter, she said: “You don’t win by meeting any kind of negativity head-on. You just have to say, well, I don’t know what that was but, all right. I wasn’t in the room when he did that, so I don’t know.” “Only a dope would use steroids for curling — but I mention this because it’s interesting how they revoked his medal: Olympic officials, they took his medal, they put it on the ice, and they gently pushed it away.” — JIMMY KIMMEL “Oh, I’m sure that’s in the school budget, too. ‘Sorry, kids, we had to cut the music budget, but you can still watch Mr. Hutchinson polish his Glock in the darkened band room.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT, critiquing Trump’s suggestion at a meeting on Thursday that some teachers should receive bonuses for carrying guns  On “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Guillermo parodied the music video for Drake’s new single, “God’s Plan.” Drake’s plan was to give away $1 million. Guillermo wasn’t working with quite the same budget. On the flip side of the same theme, Bill Gates truly has no idea what it’s like to shop for groceries anymore. Desus and Mero annotated an Ellen DeGeneres bit featuring Gates. Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers were pre-empted all week in favor of the Olympics. They’ll be back on the air starting Monday. And we’ll be back starting Tuesday morning. Our chief TV critic watched the Rubio town hall. It got him thinking about how, when you let teenagers into the political arena, they flout the rules of what it’s acceptable to discuss.  See More » ",2018-02-23,0.0015387837,Friday
Metro,421," By DAVID W. CHEN and ETHAN STERENFELDFEB. 20, 2018 EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. — When classes were dismissed Tuesday at East Brunswick High School, students could be seen yelling and laughing as they exited the building, just as they would on any other day. Except that it wasn’t a typical day. Outside the school building, the lights of three police vehicles flashed continuously. Students who normally did not wear their IDs on a lanyard were required to because of tightened security. And everywhere, students said, people were talking about the school board’s decision last week to place armed police officers inside the schools. “It’s sad, but, at the same time, it’s kind of needed,” said Faith Hutson, a 17-year-old junior who is a member of the student council. “If that’s what we have to do in order for us to be safe, I’m fine with it.” Tuesday was the first day that a new policy adding armed police officers to the security forces at East Brunswick schools took effect. The measure, approved by the school district on Thursday night, thrust this central New Jersey town into the spotlight as one of the first districts to take concrete action on security in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., shooting.  Across New Jersey, several other towns have had to deal with a spate of false alarms and threats. The town of Nutley closed its schools Friday after police investigated a threat made on Instagram.  And at a news conference Tuesday about gun safety in schools, Gov. Philip D. Murphy announced that the New Jersey State Police would start regular, but unannounced, officer visits to the 107 schools in districts where it has jurisdiction. “Any parent watching should feel that we are doing everything we can,” Mr. Murphy said during the news conference, which was carried live by local television stations. New Jersey has some of the toughest gun laws in the country. But at the news conference, Mr. Murphy, a Democrat who has been a staunch gun control advocate, vowed to work with the state Legislature, controlled by Democrats, to sign several bills that had been vetoed by his predecessor, Chris Christie, a Republican. East Brunswick is adding armed police officers to complement its 71 school resource officers — all of them retired law-enforcement officers — throughout its 11 schools. The officers will not necessarily be assigned to a specific post, but rather move around different areas, and be a visible presence, talking to students and teachers and other staff. And while the district did not specify the number of officers being hired, Victor Valeski, the schools superintendent, said that the district would spend $434,000 on the initiative, a small increase in a budget that exceeds $150 million. “They were saddened to make this decision but they knew it was the right decision to make,” he said about the school board.      Brad J. Cohen, East Brunswick’s mayor, who was a former member of the board of education, said that the decision was “not a knee-jerk reaction” but rather something that had been contemplated for several years. But after consulting with police officials and others, the township came up with its proposal. “I’m just hoping that it’s a deterrent,” Mr. Cohen said. “What angers me is the negative people out there who say you’re arming schools, you’re going to create a hostile working environment for students. I’m sorry, if someone is murdered in the schools, they’re going to be scarred for the rest of their lives.” East Brunswick’s move comes as other schools contemplate additional security. Around the country, more than 42 percent of schools now have school resource officers, law enforcement officers who have arrest authority and have specialized training, according to a 2017 report from the National Center for Education Statistics.  Patrick Kissane, executive director of the New Jersey Association of School Resource Officers, praised East Brunswick’s decision, but said that it was crucial that the police officers be able to work with teenagers. “They’re there as a mentor, as a role model, they’re building relationships,” said Mr. Kissane, who is also deputy chief of the Fort Lee Police Department. In East Brunswick, Frank Tornabene, 50, was waiting after school in his BMW convertible for his son, a fourth-grader, outside Central Elementary School. Like most people interviewed, he praised the new policy, saying “it’s about time. You can’t put a price on anything that has to do with the safety of kids.” But he also worried about whether things would truly be safer, in the long run. “I hope it’s not just gung ho in the beginning and things dwindle down,” he said.

Sports,422," Supported by By Billy Witz TAMPA, Fla. — The old standbys were in place for the Yankees’ exhibition opener at Steinbrenner Field: a high school marching band, bunting hanging from the front of the suites and a near-capacity crowd. But there was something else hanging in the air on this sun-soaked Friday afternoon: expectations. “The expectation level is through the roof,” said Mario Ranieri Jr., a lifelong Yankees fan who attended the game with his father, Mario Sr., and his son, Anthony. “Everybody’s got us winning the World Series and the Super Bowl.” Perhaps that’s possible — the Yankees after all recently acquired the rights to Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson — but Friday was more about the anticipation after last season’s rousing playoff run, which ended one game short of the World Series, and the off-season acquisition of the slugger Giancarlo Stanton. With Aaron Judge coming off shoulder surgery and not expected to make his spring debut until the middle of next week — and with Gary Sanchez also out of the lineup until Monday night — the spotlight was ceded to Stanton, the reigning National League most valuable player, who hit 59 home runs last season. Stanton, who played right field for four innings, drew a walk and grounded into a double play before departing from the Yankees’ 3-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers. Stanton received a long, loud welcome from fans when the lineups were introduced, and he couldn’t help noticing. Asked how the day was different from his exhibition openers with the Miami Marlins, who drafted him 10 years ago, Stanton paused for a moment. “This is better,” he said with a smile. “More excitement,” he continued. “I’d say, ‘Can’t wait, happy for spring.’ It’s a spring game, but ‘can’t wait to see what we can do.’ That’s what would be the difference.” Stanton said that when the Yankees break camp in five weeks, he would like to be “feeling how I would when I’m grooving in a season. That’s a little bit of everything — timing, sight. I think the thing that takes the longest is the mental aspect of the pitches, the sequencing, how they’re going to pitch with runners on, without — getting the rust off of that.” Those are the words of an established star. For many others, Friday marked the start of a pursuit of the few roster spots that are up for grabs: second and third base, and perhaps a spot in the bullpen if the Yankees carry eight relievers. Second baseman Gleyber Torres, the slight front-runner among six candidates for the starting job, dove for Leonys Martin’s leadoff grounder up the middle. The ball glanced off his glove, and Torres rose gingerly, not over concern about his left arm — which needed elbow surgery last August — but because he had the wind knocked out of him. “You do hold your breath a little more for your guys now in this role,” said Aaron Boone, who left the ESPN broadcast booth to manage the Yankees this season. But Boone was pleased that Torres, who later forgot how many outs there were, could begin to settle in. Torres, who wore a long-sleeved Michael Jordan “I’m back” T-shirt — a comeback announcement that came nine months before Torres was born — said he was not thinking about the competition. “I just try to stay focused, do my job every day,” he said. One of Torres’s competitors, Tyler Wade, was able to distinguish himself. Though he could not corral a bad-hop grounder while playing shortstop and was charged with an error, Wade stretched a base hit to center field into a double, advanced to third on a balk that he may have forced and came home on Jake Cave’s groundout to tie the score at 1-1 in the sixth. Jorge Saez later added a two-out, two-run single in the inning. Wade, who hit .155 in sporadic duty with the Yankees, said earlier in the day that he hoped to use this spring to show the type of dynamic player he had been at Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. “I’m excited to show my game,” Wade said. It was the first meeting between the Tigers and the Yankees since last August, when there were three bench-clearing brawls, including one that began with a confrontation between the Tigers star Miguel Cabrera and Yankees catcher Austin Romine. When Cabrera came to bat in the first inning Friday, he appeared to have a quick word with Romine. “I think on some level, baseball players never forget things,” Boone said. “One of our messages will always be we’re out there to win games and compete, and turn the page on those kinds of things the best we can.” INSIDE PITCH Both teams — like others in baseball — wore the caps of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, the site of last week’s shooting in Parkland, Fla. … Along with adding protective netting at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees have added 10-foot netting behind the dugouts at Steinbrenner Field. It may not be high enough. Yankees outfielder Estevan Florial lost his grip on a bat, which went flying over the net on the first-base dugout before a fan reached up and grabbed it. “A fan made a heck of a catch over there,” Boone said.

Business,423," By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUMFEB. 22, 2018 OXON HILL, Md. — It did not seem like a coincidence that the very first panel of this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference took direct aim at the state of journalism in the United States. The opening session on Thursday, “An Affair to Remember: How the Far Left and the Mainstream Media Got in Bed Together,” began with a YouTube-style mash-up of the year’s biggest media blunders. The audience jeered Joy Behar of “The View” and Jim Acosta of CNN; it whooped at a clip of President Trump thundering at Mr. Acosta, “You are fake news.” This annual gathering is usually a moment to hammer out what divides the fractious conservative movement. What it has revealed so far is what unites it: contempt for “#fakenews” and the journalists that the former Breitbart News writer Ben Shapiro memorably described as “advocates of leftism, masquerading as objective truth-tellers.” Mr. Shapiro, 34, a provocateur with a growing following among millennial conservatives, brought the crowd to its feet when he declared, “The media are lying about you, they are lying about me.” Some attendees turned toward the reporters gathered in the back of a hotel ballroom here and gave them a taunting thumbs down.  But Mr. Shapiro was far from the most prominent speaker whose fiery media criticism delighted the conservative faithful.  Vice President Mike Pence accused journalists of “fawning” over the sister of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Her sphinx-like appearance beside Mr. Pence at the Winter Olympics in South Korea this month drew wide attention. Some commentators had criticized Mr. Pence for remaining seated when the unified Korean Olympic team marched in the opening ceremony, a snub that they called disrespectful to American allies in South Korea. “For all those in the media who think I should have stood and cheered with the North Koreans, I say the United States of America doesn’t stand with murderous dictatorships; we stand up to murderous dictatorships,” Mr. Pence said, his words nearly drowned out by applause and cheers. Perhaps the most fervent anti-media broadsides came from Dana Loesch, the spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, who used her remarks to accuse news organizations of rooting for gun massacres. “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” Ms. Loesch said, eliciting nods and approving shouts. Addressing the reporters in the room, she said:“You guys love it. I’m not saying that you love the tragedy, but I am saying that you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold.” The incendiary dig was not much of a surprise at a conference that attracts a wide spectrum of right-wing groups and news outlets, many of which have honed the provocation of liberals into a fine, and sometimes profitable, art.      Still, some of Ms. Loesch’s other remarks — reiterating the N.R.A.’s arguments for defending the Second Amendment and calling for more guns in schools — drew a more tepid reaction from the audience, perhaps a sign of how the national outcry after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., has become a backdrop for this week’s gathering. It was her media attacks that played best, like when she said that she needed a security detail to leave the televised CNN town hall with gun violence survivors where she spoke on Wednesday night.  “There were people rushing the stage and screaming, ‘Burn her,’” Ms. Loesch said. A CNN spokesman said on Thursday that the network’s security personnel accompanied all the town hall speakers, including Ms. Loesch, from the stage, and that Ms. Loesch also had her own private security. The spokesman did not say whether she had been threatened. After Ms. Loesch’s remarks on Thursday, some journalists chafed at the idea that they were exploiting the deaths of children. “The point of all of this is to say that people in the media aren’t real human beings with souls and families and feelings, which is disgusting,” Elise Foley, a reporter at HuffPost, wrote on Twitter. The scorn toward journalists here reflected genuine concern from some attendees that mainstream news outlets willfully misunderstand conservatives. Several speakers expressed a sense of victimhood, that their beliefs were portrayed by reporters as intolerant or tantamount to bigotry. And there were reminders that the media-as-punching-bag trope among conservatives is a tactic that shows few signs of going away. “They think it’s just because President Trump is being mean to the media and we’re all following Trump,” Mr. Shapiro said from the stage, referring to his followers’ disdain toward the press. “No,” he added, pausing before the punch line. “We didn’t like you guys before.” Daniel Victor contributed reporting from New York.

Travel,424," Supported by The 52 Places Traveler Richness is everywhere in the Colombian capital, from vivid street art to what may be the gaudiest restaurant you’ve ever seen.  By Jada Yuan “So, where are you going in Colombia?” someone, usually Colombian, would ask me with anticipation. “Medellín? Cartagena?” “No, Bogotá.” “Just Bogotá?” “Just Bogotá.”  “Are you sure? Can you change that?”  One Bogotá resident even used an expression I had thought only popped up in awkward workshops in Spanish class: “¡Qué lástima!” (“What a shame!”)   Bustling and built for governing, Colombia’s capital isn’t a colonial jewel of the Caribbean like Cartagena, or a hot spot like Medellín — Pablo Escobar’s former home base. Instead, Bogotanos seem to talk about their city the way the Milanese sometimes talk about Milan: as somewhere they love to live and work, but may hesitate to send an extranjero, or foreigner, to taste their country’s richness.  Richness, though, is everywhere in Bogotá, from its street art depicting a history of conflict to the looming hills of protected parkland that line its eastern border. And it is an essential place to visit to understand the country. I’d come here because I’m on a yearlong trip to visit every destination on The Times’s 52 Places to Go in 2018 list, and Colombia is No. 2.  Last summer, guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) handed over their weapons to the government, ending decades of fighting. “It’s unprecedented how we can travel in the country now,” said Juan C. Rodriguez, an engineer and Facebook friend who offered to show me around. “I just took my family last year to Florencia, which used to be a major war hub, and the place that I live in, La Calera, 45 minutes from where we are; 25 years ago it was violently taken over by the FARC.” He later told me that the FARC had ambushed and murdered his cousin.  Safety is still a concern. Armed guards with bomb- and drug-sniffing dogs are standard at most public parking garages. Regardless, I was enamored enough with what I saw to extend my stay from six to seven days. Here’s a starter kit on ways to experience beautiful, complicated Bogotá. If this is Colombia’s ugly stepchild, I can’t wait to see the rest.  Before arriving in Bogotá, I heard two things: that I absolutely had to go to Andrés Carne de Res, and that it’s a rip-off and I’d be a walking cliché if I did. Both sides seemed to agree that it would likely be the gaudiest restaurant I’d ever see in my life — which, of course, meant I had to go.  Glowing red hearts, Catholic iconography and wrought iron chandeliers with bulbs of every color make up just some of this mini-chain’s “more is more” décor. On weekdays, go to Andrés D.C. for steak and traditional fare. It’s named after Dante’s “The Divine Comedy”; has themed floors for Infierno, Tierra, Purgatorio and Cielo; and was minutes away from the Click Clack Hotel, where I stayed some nights in the chic, uptown neighborhood of El Chicó. In a nearby mall is a more mellow food court, La Plaza de Andrés, where a young Colombian data journalism professor, María Isabel Magaña, took me one evening to gorge on queso-filled arepas de choclo, chicharrones and mashed-and-fried plantain patacones — still surrounded by things like a lifesize plastic cow wearing sunglasses. The flagship, Carne de Res, is in Chía, north of the city center. It seats 2,100 people, with room for 4,000 on its wildest nights, and is absolutely worth a trip on weekends when it’s teeming with sweaty rumba dancers partying till 3 a.m.  (For a rumba party that’s less of a trek, try Gaira Café, owned by the Colombian pop star and Shakira collaborator Carlos Vives.)  Usaquén is a charming colonial town north of Bogotá that became part of the city in the 1950s, but still feels like a world apart. A shopping and dining district, it’s home to Colombia’s only W Hotel, as well as a Sunday flea market where indigenous merchants sell handcrafted bucket bags and skateboarding sneakers embroidered with traditional patterns. One can find similar wares in Bogotá’s old town, La Candelaria, but I felt more relaxed wandering around Usaquén. Don’t skip the food stands, which offer everything from five-layer cake to grilled ears of corn on a stick, dripping with butter and salt. Home to the world’s largest collection of pre-Hispanic gold artifacts, this museum offers free tours in English or Spanish. You’ll learn about the spiritual lives of Colombia’s indigenous tribes, who believed that gold contained the energy of the sun and assigned it no monetary value. I got, dare I say it, bored looking at all those static, shiny objects. But after talking to Mr. Rodriguez, I had a much better sense of the museum’s significance. “It’s the story of how the Spaniards came all the way through the jungle looking for El Dorado, a city of gold — and there was some truth to that — but they came for the money, and they destroyed these highly spiritually evolved people,” he said. “It’s a story of greed. That’s the story of how Bogotá became a Spanish town.”  Cyclists here often seem as abundant as cars, streaming down equally abundant protected paths. Bogotá is credited as the first city to host a Ciclovía — and it still does, shutting down large swaths of street every Sunday for bikers, pedestrians and even acrobats.  Itching to get on two wheels, I joined a three-hour ride that offered a fascinating look at the city through the eyes of our guide, Michael Steven Sánchez Navas, a graffiti artist and passionate enemy of inequality. He told us about Justin-Bieber-gate, when the Canadian singer tagged a wall under police protection just a few months after the police had shot and killed a popular graffiti artist — and inadvertently sparked a street artist uprising. He also briefed us on mistakes he’d thought had been made in the city, including the introduction of nonnative, invasive trees to the Cerros Orientales (Eastern Hills). “Our government decided that the pines and the eucalyptus make our city more fashionable,” he said.  Some fruits in Colombian markets can be found elsewhere, but the freshness and variety here is unparalleled. Among my favorites were pitahaya amarilla, or yellow dragon fruit; granadilla, a relative of passion fruit; cherimoya, filled with white flesh wrapped around inedible black seeds; mangostino, a purple bulb containing sweet wedges that look like garlic; and uchuva, which look like orange cherries, grow in pods, and taste like heaven. Towering above all of them, though, is the lulo: tart and kiwi-like. It’s often chopped up and mixed with water, lime and sugar for a drink called a lulada that is so thick you have to eat it with a spoon. I dream about it daily.  After three attempts to take a cable car up to Monserrate, a famous hilltop with a cathedral, and being stymied by weather or operating hours, I’d given up on getting an eagle-eye view of the city. Then Mr. Rodriguez showed me the lookouts on Via La Calera, north of the tourist sector. It was a stress-free way to understand Bogotá’s vastness.  The invitation to this clandestine, monthly Mexican dinner came from a friend of a friend who’d married a Colombian and had moved to Bogotá from New York City. We followed instructions to gather in an apartment building lobby and then filed into a private library with a table set for 20. There, the chef Ximena Leal served us a home-cooked, four-course meal with unlimited margaritas for $32 a person. Best of all was the conversation, particularly from a clinical psychologist, Maria Meme Esguerra, who declared: “We won’t talk about politics and we won’t talk about religion, but we can talk about sex because that’s the one thing we can agree on.”   While eating ajiaco (a thick stew of potato, chicken and corn) at La Puerta Falsa in the old town, I befriended a retired couple. They were headed to Teatro Colón for “Vive Zaperoco,” a musical about the cowboy culture of Colombia’s Llanos Orientales (Eastern Plains), and it turned out there were tickets available in the nosebleed section. The Spanish was too advanced for me, but the dancing was marvelous: rhythmic stomping and mating rituals between men in black cowboy outfits and women in colorful skirts that flared out to their waists when they twirled. When the audience stomped along with them, the whole floor shook, like an earthquake of appreciation for the arts.   Memorize where you’re going on a map before you set off on an outing. Locals warned me against walking alone at night and pulling out my phone in public. When I got bold, at 11 a.m., and texted a friend from a food market, both the female purveyor at the fruit-salad counter where I was sitting and the gentleman dining next to me cautioned that I’d likely marked myself for robbery. He happened to be a taxi driver and got me to my next destination. At Hotel-Spa Casa de Lavim, where I stayed for $47 a night in the hip Chapinero district, the male staffers often walked with me on distances as short as between cabs and the front door. On the plus side, I got the sense that I could turn to anyone on the street and get an immediate helping hand.  Jada Yuan will be traveling to every place on this year’s 52 Places to Go list.

Washington,425," By THOMAS KAPLANMARCH 21, 2018 WASHINGTON — With government funding set to run out this weekend, congressional leaders agreed on a voluminous $1.3 trillion spending bill on Wednesday that would beef up domestic and military programs and keep the government open through September. “Every bill takes compromise, and there was plenty here,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, “but at the end of the day, we Democrats feel very good because so many of our priorities for the middle class were included.” The House and Senate have until midnight Friday to pass the spending bill to avoid what would be the third government shutdown of the year. As part of the spending talks, congressional leaders worked in recent days to resolve disputes over issues like immigration, a wall on the southern border with Mexico, health care and a planned rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey that has drawn the ire of President Trump. As the negotiations wrapped up on Capitol Hill, the president himself emerged as a potential obstacle, waffling on Wednesday about whether he could support the final package in part because it lacked sufficient funding for his wall. To salvage the agreement, Speaker Paul D. Ryan went to the White House residence to meet with Mr. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Marc Short, the White House legislative affairs chief, with Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, joining by telephone.  A White House official said the group smoothed over differences over a number of items, including the wall and other border issues, as well as transportation and military funding.  Afterward, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, issued an upbeat statement making it clear that Mr. Trump had overcome his reservations, saying that he and the congressional leaders had “discussed their support for the bill.” The president appeared to endorse the deal late Wednesday night, even as he vented frustration about the compromises that made it possible. “Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming,” he wrote on Twitter. “Most importantly, got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military, $716 Billion next year...most ever. Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.” Democrats were able to exert influence in the negotiations over the spending bill because votes from their party are needed to approve the legislation in the Senate and will most likely be needed in the House, as well. The text of the spending bill, spanning 2,232 pages, was unveiled Wednesday night. To improve border security, the measure includes $1.6 billion for more than 90 miles of physical barriers along the border with Mexico, as well as related technology, according to congressional aides. But there are strings attached to what can be built, and the funding is far short of the total Mr. Trump would ultimately need to build his promised “big, beautiful wall.” Some of the funding is for replacing existing barriers. The spending bill does not resolve the uncertain fate of hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, who have been protected under an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, that Mr. Trump has moved to end.  But the president squarely put the blame on Democrats on Wednesday, writing that they “refused to take care of DACA. Would have been so easy, but they just didn’t care. I had to fight for Military and start of Wall.” Mr. Trump’s closing of the DACA program is being challenged in court, and an effort to pass immigration legislation failed last month in the Senate. Over the weekend, the White House offered to extend protections for DACA recipients for two and a half years in exchange for $25 billion for the border wall, according to congressional aides. Democrats countered by offering $25 billion in wall funding in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for a broader population of Dreamers, which the White House rejected. An effort by some lawmakers to include in the spending bill a proposal to shore up insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act was unsuccessful, at least in part because of a dispute over abortion. But the bill includes a fix to the so-called grain glitch, a flaw in the sweeping tax overhaul passed last year that stood to hurt certain agricultural businesses.      Another sticking point in recent days was funding for a series of rail infrastructure projects in the New York City area known as the Gateway program, including a new tunnel under the Hudson River. Despite his New York roots, Mr. Trump zeroed in on Gateway and urged Republican leaders not to provide federal funds for it — an apparent rebuke to Mr. Schumer, whose caucus the president has repeatedly accused of obstructionism. The spending bill does not include $900 million in funding for Gateway that had been included last year in House legislation. But according to a senior Senate Democratic aide, it includes hundreds of millions of dollars that could go toward the Gateway program, including funds that do not require the approval of Mr. Trump’s Transportation Department. As November’s midterm elections loom, the legislation also includes $380 million for grants to states to improve their election infrastructure and bolster election security. And although Congress has shown little appetite for passing significant gun control legislation in response to the mass shooting last month in Parkland, Fla., the spending bill includes a modest measure to improve reporting to the national background check system for gun purchases. It also includes a measure to provide grants to improve school safety. Congress approved a broad two-year budget deal last month that paved the way for this week’s legislation. That deal set overall spending levels, raising strict limits on military and domestic spending by a total of about $140 billion this year. The spending bill this week allocates the allowed spending among a vast array of federal programs.  The bill is long overdue, coming almost halfway through the 2018 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. Since then, Congress has needed five stopgap spending measures to keep the government open. By snapping that streak of short-term patches, lawmakers would provide a dose of stability to federal agencies that have been left in limbo as Congress lurched from one stopgap measure to the next. Even with the spending bill unveiled, there is still some risk of a brief shutdown this weekend, as any one senator can stop the Senate from speeding up consideration of the bill to meet Friday’s deadline. Last month, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, did just that, causing an hourslong shutdown as he bemoaned the government’s mounting debt. This time around, with lawmakers expected to vote on a gigantic spending bill with little time to digest its contents, Mr. Paul is unhappy yet again. “It’s a rotten, terrible, no-good way to run your government,” he said Tuesday, adding, “Really, should we be looking in thousand-page bills with 24 hours to decide what’s in them?” He was not the only lawmaker with such frustration. “Whoever designed this process is not qualified to run a food truck,” said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. “It’s embarrassing. And as bad as it looks from the outside, you ought to see it from the inside.” The approval of the spending bill would be another blow to those worried about the government’s ballooning debt, which has topped $21 trillion. That issue seemed of little concern on Capitol Hill as Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers pushed for much more military funding, and Democrats demanded similar increases for domestic priorities. The spending bill will leave lawmakers from both parties with much to boast about, including billions of dollars for infrastructure and for fighting the opioid epidemic, as well as the biggest increase in military funding in years. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military,” Mr. Ryan said after the bill was unveiled, while conceding, “No bill of this size is perfect.” The spending spree comes on the heels of the Republicans’ tax overhaul, which was projected to add $1.5 trillion to federal budget deficits over a decade. The deficit is now expected to exceed $1 trillion in the 2019 fiscal year, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group. The spending bill gave the most conservative members of Congress little to celebrate. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, expressed disappointment with the modest funding for fortifying the border.  “It is troubling when we get a tunnel and we don’t get a wall,” he said. “The last time I checked, the president didn’t make any promises about getting a tunnel in any of his campaign stops, at least not in North Carolina.” Follow Thomas Kaplan on Twitter: @thomaskaplan.

Culture,426," By JON CARAMANICAMARCH 21, 2018 One of the promises of last year’s SoundCloud rap explosion was that it might upend hip-hop’s center, injecting punk energy and brusqueness into a genre that has threatened to become complacent with its ostentation, its melody and its largely unchallenged seat atop pop. And yet something slightly different has been happening: Many of the sound’s key players — Lil Pump, Smokepurpp, Trippie Redd — have been absorbed into the music industry, becoming a kind of farm team for hip-hop’s mainstream. Their radicalism has been muted in hopes that they might not burn too hot too fast. Especially given that context, the new albums from two of the scene’s most popular and controversial figures — “?” by XXXTentacion and “DAY69” by 6ix9ine — are striking in their willingness to deviate from the norms of the movement that birthed them, and also from hip-hop’s prevailing sound. These are aesthetic positions being staked out, to be sure, but they are also likely the result of social and cultural forces. Both artists have found success in spite of behavior that has landed them in legal trouble, alienated many, and made an uncomplicated embrace of them an impossibility.  XXXTentacion (born Jahseh Onfroy) was arrested in 2016 on various charges that included witness tampering and aggravated battery of a pregnant woman; deposition testimony from the woman obtained by Pitchfork last year paints an unbearable picture of an abusive and violent relationship. In 2015, 6ix9ine (born Daniel Hernandez) pleaded guilty to a felony count of using a minor in a sexual performance. In a criminal complaint obtained by Jezebel, he describes participating in the recording and posting of videos in which a 13-year-old girl performs sex acts.  In another era, this information might have been enough to derail these artists’ careers before they gained any traction. But hip-hop’s outlaw mythology has always been strong; because of that, among other reasons, the self-cleaning of suspected abusers that has swept through other industries hasn’t yet taken hold in hip-hop. Also, for an artist to have his career derailed, someone has to say no. But thanks to the fluidity of the streaming ecosystem, the internet moves faster than any gatekeeper, and both XXXTentacion and 6ix9ine (formerly Tekashi69) have found success rapidly. “Look at Me,” XXXTentacion’s breakthrough, went to No. 34 on the Billboard Hot 100, the first of several hits. “Sad!,” from his new album, debuted even higher, at No. 17. 6ix9ine’s debut single “Gummo” went to No. 12, and three subsequent songs have cracked the top 50. “DAY69,” which was released last month, made its debut at No. 4 on the Billboard album chart, and “?,” released last Friday, is expected to be next week’s No. 1. So while both of these artists operate under heavy clouds of suspicion and distaste, they are finding wide and dedicated audiences. However, even in spite of some high-profile acknowledgments — both Kendrick Lamar and the Weeknd have posted about XXXTentacion on social media, and Young Thug, Offset and A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie appear on “DAY69” — they haven’t been fully publicly embraced by the music industry. Instead, it is operating in the shadows for both artists: Billboard has reported that XXXTentacion is signed to Caroline, a division of Capitol Music Group, and 6ix9ine is signed to the label of Elliot Grainge, who is the son of Lucian, the chairman and chief executive of Universal Music Group. This de facto exile has ended up embedded into their creative process, though, pushing these artists to the fringes, where they are less bound by hip-hop’s conventions, or the needs of the music business. As a result, they have both made albums that break from the dominant sound in notable ways. XXXTentacion, messianic and immature, recorded “?” while on house arrest awaiting trial. It is a chaotic album, ping-ponging between bawdy, punchy rapping and tender, lonely singing — a blend that goes back to his days posting loose tracks on SoundCloud. The best songs here are the most vulnerable, like “before I close my eyes,” on which he croons, “I hope it’s not too late for me,” embedding his public narrative into his creative identity. Just as the music operates at polar extremes, so does XXXTentacion’s mood. Sometimes he is deeply petulant, like on the sticky “Sad!”; elsewhere, as on “Numb,” he’s self-lacerating. One song, “Hope,” is dedicated to the survivors of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting. Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.     Both he and 6ix9ine engage with rap-rock in a sidelong fashion. XXXTentacion harks back to the late-2000s Warped Tour, when melodic hardcore and screamo began flirting with hip-hop, in terms of cadences and also production textures. 6ix9ine, on the other hand, is often more reminiscent of New York hardcore than New York hip-hop. When he’s at his most rap-adjacent, it’s in the spirit of the early Ruff Ryders era, one of hip-hop’s rowdiest and rawest moments. (He also nods to the fusion of the “Judgment Night” soundtrack and the horrorcore of the mid- to late 1990s — a one-man Family Values tour in the making.)  6ix9ine is a brute-force screamer, and “DAY69” is a rough gauntlet of gun and sex talk, invigorating and also deadening. As a rapper, 6ix9ine is a boxer — he thrives on rasp and repetition, as if constantly looking to pick a fistfight. Occasionally he incorporates a touch of wordplay — “I need all of mine, try to try me and it’s Columbine/Let that Ruger fly, automatic poppin’ at your guys/You gon’ lose a guy, ’tato on the barrel, give ’em fries” on “CHOCOLATÉ” — but mostly he’s landing one jab after the next. For both artists, songs are short — around a 2:08 average for XXXTentacion (including interludes) and 2:28 for 6ix9ine — because their bursts of energy might not last another 90 seconds, and because there is little infrastructure in place to push them toward more conventional structures. (For what it’s worth, most pop songs are only interesting for about two minutes.) Many of XXXTentacion’s songs don’t feel like much more than demos, experiments that under other circumstances might be thickened up for broader appeal. And both push back against naming conventions — most of 6ix9ine’s song titles are one word, two syllables, beginning with a consonant and ending with a vowel and most crucially, in all caps, like he is screaming the name of an off-brand Pokémon character (“DOOWEE,” “KOODA,” “MOOKY”). XXXTentacion’s titles vary widely — some short and terse (and also in all caps), some long and sentence-like (but lowercase except for the I’s). If these artists were being fully embraced, these rough edges might be sanded down, but instead they’re left unchallenged. And as XXXTentacion and 6ix9ine become popular, even in spite of their rejection in some circles, those outlier sonic choices begin to become normalized, and also stand out by comparison to the flattening of their peers’ sounds and identities. Unintentionally, that exclusion might be creating the circumstances for these artists to not only thrive themselves, but to become the ones influencing the shape of the genre for years to come.

Opinion,427," Supported by Editorial By The Editorial Board As surely as there are camels’ backs and straws to break them, moments arrive when citizens say they’ve had enough, when they rise up against political leaders who do not speak for them and whose moral fecklessness imperils lives. We may be witness to such a moment now with the protests by American teenagers sickened — and terrified — by the latest mass murder at the hands of someone with easy access to a weapon fit for a battlefield, not a school. These kids have had enough. They’ve had enough of empty expressions of sympathy in the wake of the sort of atrocities they’ve grown up with, like last week’s mass shooting that took 17 lives at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Enough of the ritualistic mouthing of thoughts and prayers for the victims. Enough of living in fear that they could be next in the cross hairs of a well-armed deranged killer, even with all the active shooter drills and lockdowns they’ve gone through. Enough of craven politicians who kneel before the National Rifle Association and its cynically fundamentalist approach to the Second Amendment. They are asking in what kind of country are children sent off to school with bulletproof book bags strapped to their backs — capable, one manufacturer, Bullet Blocker, says, of “stopping a .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, 9mm, .45 caliber hollow point ammunition and more.” “I was born 13 months after Columbine,” a 12th grader named Faith Ward said on Monday, referring to the school massacre in Littleton, Colo., in 1999, the dawn of the modern wave of school shootings. Ms. Ward spoke to a television reporter at an anti-gun demonstration outside her school in Plantation, Fla. “This is all I have ever known,” she said, “this culture of being gunned down for no reason, and this culture of people saying, ‘Oh, let’s send thoughts and prayers’ for three days, and then moving on. And I’m tired of it.” So are we all. It is too soon to tell if this righteous anger augurs a sustained youth movement for gun sanity, going beyond the occasional protest. We hope it does. It’s time, once again, for America to listen to its children. Who among us have more at stake than they? Sensible young people have it in their power to make their senseless elders take heed — and act. We saw it happen during the Vietnam War half a century ago. Young people, initially reviled by establishment forces as unwashed, longhaired traitors, energized an antiwar movement that swept the country and, even if it took years, ultimately ended America’s misguided adventure in Southeast Asia. To be effective, any movement needs a realistic program, not mere emotion. Otherwise, it risks coming and going in a flash with little to show for itself. A tighter federal system of background checks is a start, to better monitor would-be gun buyers with mental illness, for example, or histories of gun violence. Such a program should also include reinstating a nationwide ban on assault weapons — a state measure died in the Florida Legislature Tuesday — and ending an absurd prohibition against using federal public health funds to study gun violence. Even President Trump, who told an N.R.A. convention last April that “you have a true friend and champion in the White House,” has signaled he might be willing to improve the system. The Washington Post reported that after Mr. Trump saw the coverage of the student protesters, he asked Mar-a-Lago guests whether he should do more about gun control. On Tuesday, he ordered that regulations be written to ban bump stocks, devices that can make an automatic weapon out of a semiautomatic. Beyond that, though, it’s hard to tell if he means business when he says he’s open to more thorough background checks. Steadfastness is not a Trump hallmark. However, if young people channeling this angry moment remain steadfast, they might not only force his hand but also stiffen the resolve of other elected officials and candidates. Horrific school shootings aside, they are vulnerable every day to gun mayhem at a stomach-churning rate. The journal Pediatrics reported last June that gunfire, each week, kills an average of 25 children ages 17 and under. A 2016 study in The American Journal of Medicine calculated that among two dozen of the world’s wealthiest nations, this country alone accounted for 91 percent of firearms deaths among children 14 and under. What the young protesters are saying now is: Put down the guns. We’re your children. How can anyone not heed their pained voices?

Opinion,428," Supported by By Frank Bruni Opinion Columnist SAN ANTONIO —  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s wish list of House seats to flip from red to blue includes slightly over 100 districts — remember, it’s a wish list — and is chockablock with the usual swing states. Ohio makes six appearances; Pennsylvania, seven. Wisconsin is present and more promising than ever, with Paul Ryan’s soon-to-be-open spot squarely in Democrats’ sights. But wait, what’s this? Texas once, Texas twice, Texas five times in all. It reads like a typo. It looks like a delusion. Predominantly Republican and perversely gerrymandered, the Lone Star State is where Democrats send their dreams to die. Only 11 of its 36 House seats are in the party’s hands. But 2018 is shaping up as a year in which old rules are out the window and everything is up for grabs. Ryan’s planned retirement and the increasing disarray of the Republican Party illustrate that. So does Texas’ emergence as a credible wellspring of Democratic hope. Leave aside the Senate contest and Beto O’Rourke’s surprisingly muscular (if nonetheless improbable) bid to topple Ted Cruz. Several of the most truly competitive House races in the country are in Texas, which could wind up providing Democrats three or more of the 24 flipped seats that they need for control of the chamber. The state tells the tale of the November midterms as well as anywhere else. The appeal of youth, of first-timers, of women, of veterans and of candidates of color will be tested here. And a bevy of compelling characters have emerged from the primaries on March 6 and are poised to prevail in runoffs on May 22. There’s Gina Ortiz Jones, for example. Jones, 37, is almost certain to be the Democrat challenging Representative Will Hurd in the 23rd District, which sprawls from San Antonio to the outskirts of El Paso. Despite its large numbers of rural voters, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in the 23rd by more than three points. (Clinton lost the state by nine.) Jones was an Air Force intelligence officer in Iraq. Like Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania, she drew the support of the Serve America PAC, which promotes veterans as candidates on the theory that they can help Democrats forge a cultural connection with working-class voters in swing districts. She’s Filipina-American. She’s also openly lesbian, and while Texas political analysts told me that they weren’t sure whether that would affect her bid, Jones has figured out precisely how to handle it: with brief acknowledgment and no special focus. At a recent house party in San Antonio where she introduced herself to a few dozen of the district’s voters, she mentioned that she “served under ‘don’t ask don’t tell’” but didn’t spell out the significance of that. She talked more about it during an interview with me the next day, comparing her time in the military with the anxiety and vulnerability of many minorities, particularly immigrants waiting to see what happens with the DACA program. “I don’t know what it’s like to be a Dreamer,” she told me. “But I do know what it’s like to have worked hard for something and to live in fear that it can be ripped away from you. When I was in R.O.T.C. at Boston University, I lived in fear every single day that if they found out I was gay, I would lose my scholarship. My opportunity to get an education — my opportunity to serve my country — would be taken away.” Democrats also have an excellent shot at victory in the 32nd District, a collection of Dallas neighborhoods and suburbs. Its Republican incumbent, Pete Sessions, has been in Congress for two decades, but the district has become more diverse and less white over those years, and his likely opponent, a black civil rights lawyer named Colin Allred, should benefit from that. Allred is 34. Like Jones, he’s making his first run for office. Also like her, he has an unconventional professional biography. Before getting his law degree at the University of California, Berkeley, he played professional football for the Tennessee Titans, and before that he was a football star at Baylor University in Waco and at a high school in his Dallas district. Many of its voters remember watching him play. And more of them voted for Clinton than for Trump in the presidential election, a sign of the district’s evolution and an outcome for which Democrats were so unprepared that not a single Democrat challenged Sessions in 2016. This time around, seven Democrats entered the race. Allred got 38.5 percent of the votes in the primary, more than twice that of the second-place finisher. “We’ve seen a level of activism here that is off the charts,” he told me after a town hall in Dallas where he spoke with voters about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., and the need for gun-safety legislation. Sessions is a major recipient of donations from the National Rifle Association, and Allred, echoing the campaigns of Democrats across the country, is making an issue of that. The mere existence of the runoffs that he, Jones and other Texas Democrats will compete in next month reflects Democrats’ hopes in Texas in 2018, because it means that there were three or more Democratic candidates in districts that had two, one or none in election cycles past. “Democrats smell blood in the water,” Harold Cook, a former executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, told me, “and for the first time in maybe forever, there is a Democrat running in every single congressional district in Texas, including ones where it’s a ludicrous thought that a Democrat could conceivably win.” They’re that angry about Trump and that convinced that his turbulent presidency and failure to nudge his approval rating much above 40 percent could mean an enormous blue wave. Democrats are even eyeing a few districts that Trump won, like the 21st and 31st. The 21st attracted the party’s attention largely because its Republican incumbent, Lamar Smith, isn’t seeking re-election. He decided to retire after more than three decades in the House. And the 31st? Well, it’s hard not to indulge in some optimism when your party’s leading candidate is a female war hero whose story is possibly becoming a movie, “Shoot Like a Girl,” starring Angelina Jolie. That candidate, M. J. Hegar, 42, did several tours of duty in Afghanistan as a search-and-rescue pilot and won a Purple Heart after she was wounded while saving fellow passengers when the Taliban shot down her helicopter. Richard Murray, a professor of political science at the University of Houston, told me to keep an eye as well on the 22nd District, a largely suburban swath of the Houston area that he described as a microcosm of demographic changes that are making the state ever more hospitable Democratic turf. “The suburban counties that led Republicans to dominance here 25 years ago are getting significantly less Republican fast,” he said, adding that Fort Bend County, in the 22nd, is roughly 20 percent Asian-American now. The first-place finisher in the district’s Democratic primary, Sri Preston Kulkarni, is Indian-American. Murray said that if Kulkarni wins his runoff, that could be a significant boost to Democrats’ chances to nab this House seat. Trump took the 22nd by almost 8 points. But Mitt Romney won it four years earlier by more than 25. And bear in mind that Lamb notched his Pennsylvania victory last month in a district that had gone for Trump by a margin of 19 points. “When you look at what happened in Pennsylvania,” Allred told me, “you can’t take anything off the board.” Lamb’s triumph, and the Virginia returns last November, suggest a suburban revolt against Trump. But who best understands how the winds are blowing — the national Democratic Party or local primary voters? And are those voters making smart general-election choices or romantic ones? I suspect they made the right calls with Allred and Jones, neither of whom was anointed by the party and both of whom faced primary opponents with more money and with powerful connections. In Jones’s case that was Jay Hulings, a former federal prosecutor who went to law school at Harvard with the Texas political stars Joaquin and Julián Castro. He finished fourth in the five-candidate primary, with 15 percent of the vote. Jones’s 41 percent tally was more than twice that of her nearest competitor. Allred’s better-financed and more conventionally pedigreed rival was Ed Meier, who has a master’s degree in Middle East studies from Oxford University and worked as a management consultant with McKinsey. He finished fourth among the seven primary candidates. Following their hugely impressive primary performances, Jones and Allred landed on another, more refined list — “Red to Blue” — that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee puts together. It directs donors to House candidates in especially strong positions. It’s now 33 names long. Meredith Kelly, the communications director for the D.C.C.C., told me that Jones’s and Allred’s newness to politics could prove hugely appealing. When the party did focus groups in Pennsylvania’s 18th District after Lamb’s victory, she said, “One of the biggest takeaways was that he was seen as a young, fresh face in contrast to Rick Saccone.” Saccone was 60 and had long served in the State Legislature. Lamb was 33 and had never held elected office. Allred put it to me this way: “My youth is not a bug. It’s a feature.” He and Jones are potentially formidable for additional reasons. There’s not a whiff of entitlement or the establishment about either of them. Both had single mothers of humble means. Both talk expansively and eloquently about government or community help that was crucial in their lives. Both have deep roots in their districts, where they spent their childhoods. Both are great-looking, as it happens. (That rarely hurts.) And both acknowledge the shock of Nov. 8, 2016 — and the peril of what they’ve witnessed since — as factors that motivated them to run and could be central to whether they win or lose. Trump is large in their minds and in their races. Before and immediately after the presidential election, Jones worked in the federal government as an economic and national security adviser. She hadn’t thought about a career as a lawmaker, she told me. But Election Day changed everything. “I remember a sinking feeling in my stomach,” she said, “in no small part because a lot of us thought, ‘That will never happen.’ That was not an option, because then what does that mean?” “About America?” I asked. “That’s right,” she said. She quit her bureaucratic job and became one of a record number of 309 women to file to run for House seats. There’s an unusual bounty of Democratic candidates of all kinds, and as Jones and Allred demonstrate, that’s not merely a numerical phenomenon. It has brought engaging new figures and impassioned new voices into the arena. On Nov. 6, in Texas and elsewhere, we’ll see how much that matters.

Opinion,429," Supported by By Paul Krugman Even those who have long since accepted the premise that Donald Trump is corrupt, self-centered and dishonest seem a bit shocked by his tirades over the Presidents’ Day weekend. Using the Parkland, Fla., massacre as an excuse to attack the F.B.I. for investigating Russian election intervention on his behalf — while lying about his own past denials that such intervention took place — took vileness to a new level, which is truly impressive given Trump’s previous record. Yet if you step back a bit and think about it, Trump’s latest outbursts were very much in character — and I don’t just mean his personal character. When did you last see a member of the Trump administration, or for that matter any prominent Republican, admit error or accept responsibility for problems? Don’t say that it has always been that way, that it’s just the way people are. On the contrary, taking responsibility for your actions — what my parents called being a mensch — used to be considered an essential virtue in politicians and adults in general. And in this as in so many things, there’s a huge asymmetry between the parties. Of course not all Democrats are honest and upstanding; but as far as I can tell, there’s almost nobody left in the G.O.P. willing to take responsibility for, well, anything. And I don’t think this is an accident. The sad content of modern Republican character is a symptom of the corruption and hypocrisy that has afflicted half of our body politic — a sickness of the soul that manifests itself in personal behavior as well as policy. Before I talk about that sickness, consider a few non-Trump examples of the lack of character that pervades this administration. At the trivial but still telling end of the scale, we have the tale of Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, who keeps flying first class at taxpayers’ expense. The money isn’t the important issue here, although his spending violates federal guidelines. The revealing thing, instead, is the supposed reason he needs to fly premium — you see, ordinary coach passengers have been known to say critical things to his face. Remember this story the next time someone talks about liberal “snowflakes.” More seriously, consider the behavior of John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff, whose record of slandering critics and refusing to admit error is starting to rival his boss’s. Remember when Kelly made false accusations about Representative Frederica Wilson and refused to retract those accusations even after video showed they were false? More recently, Kelly insisted that he didn’t know the full details about domestic abuse allegations against Rob Porter until, a White House staff member said, “40 minutes before he threw him out” — a claim that seems at odds with everything we know about this story. Even if this claim were true, an apology for his obliviousness seems in order. But these guys don’t apologize. Oh, and by the way: Roy Moore still hasn’t conceded. So it’s not just Trump. And it didn’t start with Trump. In fact, way back in 2006 I wrote about the “mensch gap” in the Bush administration — the unwillingness of top officials to accept responsibility for the botched occupation of Iraq, the botched response to Hurricane Katrina, and more. Nor, by the way, are we only talking about politicians. In my neck of the woods, I remain amazed by the unwillingness of right-leaning economists to admit that they were wrong in predicting that the Fed’s efforts to rescue the economy would cause runaway inflation. Being wrong is one thing — it happens to everyone, myself very much included. Refusing to admit and learn from error is something different. And let’s be clear: Personal responsibility isn’t dead everywhere. You can ask, for example, whether Hillary Clinton apologized sufficiently for her initial support of the Iraq war or her missteps in 2016 — but she did admit to making mistakes, which nobody on the other side ever seems to do. So what happened to the character of the G.O.P.? I’m pretty sure that in this case the personal is, ultimately, political. The modern G.O.P. is, to an extent never before seen in American history, a party built around bad faith, around pretending that its concerns and goals are very different from what they really are. Flag-waving claims of patriotism, pious invocations of morality, stern warnings about fiscal probity are all cover stories for an underlying agenda mainly concerned with making plutocrats even richer. And the character flaws of the party end up being echoed by the character flaws of its most prominent members. Are they bad people who chose their political affiliation because it fits their proclivities, or potentially good people corrupted by the company they keep? Probably some of both.

Washington,430," By ERICA L. GREENMARCH 20, 2018 WASHINGTON — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos defended her agency’s commitment to minority students in a wide-ranging hearing in which congressional leaders pressed Ms. DeVos on her department’s budget. Ms. DeVos testified before the House Appropriations Committee, fielding questions on the Education Department’s budget request for the fiscal year that begins in October. The request calls for a 5 percent spending cut, eliminates dozens of programs and pitches a $1 billion school choice proposal. “With this budget, we can continue to return power to those who walk side by side with students every day,” Ms. DeVos said. “Because that’s who budgets are for, not special interest, not legislators, not the system. This budget is about students.” But Democratic lawmakers disagreed that the budget would benefit all students — especially minorities.  Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, called the budget a “slap in the face” for minority students. Ms. Lee seized on a proposed $1 million cut to the department’s Office for Civil Rights, and its proposed cuts to after-school programs.  The cuts, coupled with the Trump administration’s decision to examine and possibly rescind guidance meant to protect minority students from racial discrimination in discipline and special education decisions, inflamed a debate about the department’s approach to minority students. “Your head is in the sand about racial bias and racial discrimination,” Ms. Lee said, adding: “You just don’t care about civil rights of black and brown children. This is horrible.” Ms. DeVos said that she was “very proud of the record of the Office for Civil Rights,” and that it had learned to do more with less, including resolving complaints faster. She said the office would continue to uphold laws preventing discrimination. She also said the budget preserved funding levels for poor students, and proposed school choice programs that could help minority and poor students get to better schools. “I believe this budget does very much not only protect but encourage students of color to pursue their education,” Ms. DeVos said. She also defended her agency’s re-examination of guidance issued in 2014 that sought to curb racial disparities in school discipline. The department had been eyeing the guidance for months, but it recently became a target of congressional Republicans who linked it to discipline policies at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed in a mass shooting last month. “The stated goal of the guidance is one that we all embrace, and we are committed to reviewing and considering this guidance and taking appropriate steps,” Ms. DeVos said. “But I have nothing to say at this point about where that is.”  Ms. DeVos will lead a school safety commission created by President Trump to review the guidance, among other factors believed to contribute to school shootings. On Tuesday, Ms. DeVos said the commission would comprise the heads of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security and Justice. It will meet in the next couple of weeks and hold forums with experts across the country. Ms. DeVos stopped short of relating any gun-control measure to school safety, but said she was not a member of the National Rifle Association. Ms. DeVos said a driving force behind the budget plan was an order from Mr. Trump to agency leaders to “spend taxpayer dollars efficiently.” The directive has not only resulted in a trimmer budget, but also an overhaul of Ms. DeVos’s department that drew questions from the Appropriations Committee. One week before Ms. DeVos was to go before the committee, a career staff member in the Education Department emailed members of the panel alleging that the agency was withholding information about a departmental overhaul from its budget justifications. The email was obtained by The New York Times. Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.     “Our concern is about a breakdown in communication, a culture of secrecy and a fear of retaliatory action that has prevented Budget Service from providing House and Senate appropriators and staff, and for that matter, the public, with key information about the department’s plans for fiscal year 2019,” the email said. “Given the potential for some of these proposals to radically impact the way the department carries out its mission, Congress should probably see this.” Liz Hill, the Education Department spokeswoman, said that it was “absolutely not true” that the department intentionally withheld details from Congress, and that “no final determinations have been made and therefore there is nothing to present.” “The deliberative reorganization document is just that — a deliberative document not in final form,” she said. “We are following normal protocols for department reorganization.”  While it is not abnormal for education secretaries to reorganize the department, and not many decisions require congressional approval, it is also customary for the department to share details with key committees. In the email, the staff member leaked a reorganization plan that included a consolidation of a number of administrative offices, cutting the number of regional offices in the Office for Civil Rights and acquiring several programs run by the Labor Department. Education Department officials said they had since abandoned the civil rights proposals, which were sure to be the most protested part of the proposal. They said the plan remained in flux. It was created last fall to comply with Mr. Trump’s executive order to curb the reach of federal agencies and cut duplication and inefficiency. Though the plan lays out a long-term vision, through 2022, some of its contents were displayed in a 14-page presentation to employees in February. And last week, the department announced it would reassign its budget director, the first move toward restructuring the budget office to reassign staff members elsewhere in the department. The decision, which officials said was meant to help spread expertise across the department, was made over the opposition of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, according to Politico. Several other staff changes were announced for 2019. Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told Ms. DeVos on Tuesday that she was disheartened to hear the plans for the budget office, which she said was central to managing the department’s programs and resources. Ms. DeLauro also said the shuffle, along with limited communication from department staff members, “directly impugns on the critical work of this committee, and it needs to stop.” Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the chairman of the committee, said he was concerned about “a disconnect” between Ms. DeVos’s administration and his office. “It’s hard to believe that people who have been on the job for this long don’t have staff that understand how the system works,” Mr. Frelinghuysen said. “It is important to connect with the people who pay the bills.”  The plan aligns with measures Ms. DeVos has taken to shrink her agency, which she has described as bloated. She has shed hundreds of regulations, and hundreds of staff members through attrition and voluntary buyouts. For the most part, Ms. DeVos’s restructuring plan involves consolidating offices, such as merging the office that oversees charter and private schools with the main office that oversees elementary and secondary education in public schools. The plan would eliminate the Office of the Under Secretary, a position that has helped shape higher education policy, and create an Office of Lifelong Learning. It would also reduce the number of political appointees. The proposal also seeks to acquire several programs run by the Labor Department, including ones that connect unemployed adults and former prisoners with educational services. Details of the plan surfaced amid a bitter contract dispute between the DeVos administration and the union that represents the department’s 3,900 employees. Union leaders believe the contract gutted protections that would allow its members to defend themselves in the department’s overhaul. Union officials say the agreement also stripped out previously negotiated provisions for pay increases and promotions, performance evaluations, work schedules, child care and overtime. It also limits the issues that can be brought up as grievances and eliminates a guarantee against retaliation for filing one. The contract also cuts down the use of “official time,” which employees could use to participate in union activities, a benefit Congress extended 40 years ago, and instead requires that representatives take unpaid leave for such activities with permission from their supervisors. The union said the agreement came “after months of anti-union proposals and hostile behavior at the table,” which concluded with the department’s bargaining team effectively walking away from negotiations before they even started. The department said that the union “spent more than a year dragging its feet,” and that its team failed to negotiate in good faith, ignored multiple invitations to resolve the impasse and blew multiple deadlines to submit counteroffers. The department put its final offer in place.

Here’s what you need to know: • More than a decade ago, Facebook opened itself to the world, inviting developers to build apps and programs on top of the social network’s platform. Millions of third-party apps have been created since then, and the consequences of Facebook’s loose approach to the collection of user data are becoming clear, our tech columnist writes. As Facebook grapples with questions about its role in the spread of disinformation, the company’s chief information security officer is said to be leaving. The executive, Alex Stamos, had pushed for more transparency but met resistance from other senior leaders, according to current and former employees. • Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm that harvested information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles, also sought to entrap politicians with sex or bribes, according to an investigation in Britain that included a journalist posing as a prospective client. • A male student opened fire at a high school in Southern Maryland today, injuring two students and exchanging gunfire with an officer at the school, the police said.

This week, the government hit back with videos showing President Bashar al-Assad visiting the area to congratulate his forces and to greet cheering residents. • Our correspondent reports: “Mr. Assad delivered an alternative view of the war, one in which he is assured and in charge, casually cruising past bombed-out buildings, often driving with just two fingers, an elbow propped casually out the window. It is a world in which his opponents are all terrorists and his troops all heroes.” President Bashar al-Assad of Syria appeared in a series of videos driving from Damascus to eastern Ghouta, the suburb that has been under siege for almost five years. President Vladimir V. Putin has been elected to a fourth term, drawing support from more than three-quarters of voters. How is the most powerful man in Russia staying that way? • The chaotic five-month effort to keep the Weinstein Company afloat has ended.

Washington,432," By MARK LANDLER and SCOTT SHANEFEB. 15, 2018 WASHINGTON — The United States on Thursday joined Britain in formally blaming Russia for a huge cyberattack last June that was aimed at Ukraine but crippled computers worldwide, a highly public naming-and-shaming exercise that could further fray relations with Moscow. The White House threatened unspecified “international consequences” for the attack, which it said “was part of the Kremlin’s ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia’s involvement in the ongoing conflict.” The statement, issued by the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the attack, known by the name NotPetya, was “reckless and indiscriminate” and spread rapidly, “causing billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia and the Americas.” NotPetya, which had the characteristics of a ransomware attack, had been widely identified by cybersecurity experts as coming from Russia, so the attribution was no surprise. But the decision of the United States and Britain to nearly simultaneously condemn the Russian military is noteworthy.  It underscores the dichotomy between the administration’s consistently tough stance toward Russia on issues involving Ukraine and President Trump’s continued reluctance to criticize President Vladimir V. Putin over anything else.  In December, the White House approved the sale of lethal defensive weapons to the Ukrainian military for its battle against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. Yet Mr. Trump continues to soft-pedal allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, even after the nation’s intelligence agencies concluded that it did — an assessment that intelligence chiefs reiterated in Senate testimony this week. Administration officials declined to say what steps the United States would take against Russia. But they could include both sanctions against Russian officials involved in the attack and covert measures — any of which would be likely to fray an already fragile relationship. The administration’s public statement echoed one in mid-December when it publicly blamed North Korea for a damaging ransomware attack known as Wannacry. In that case, however, the United States did not follow up with stiff penalties, in part because North Korea was already under heavy sanctions for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. “President Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea, to change their behavior,” the homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, said at the time. “So we don’t have a lot of room left here to apply pressure.” Punishing other nations for cyberattacks has proven exceedingly difficult, particularly when the players are as sophisticated as North Korea and Russia. The Russian government flatly denied the allegations that it carried out the attack. “We think they have no basis and no foundation, and this is nothing else but the continuation of the Russo-phobic campaign,” the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters. The administration had planned to issue the statement a day earlier to coincide with that of the British, according to a senior official, but delayed it after the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla.  The White House statement made no mention of an embarrassing related fact: The NotPetya attacks took advantage of vulnerabilities identified by the National Security Agency and then made public by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers. The Shadow Brokers, which some officials believe to be a front for Russian intelligence, obtained many of the N.S.A.’s most valuable hacking tools, either by breaking into the agency’s computer networks or with the help of an insider. The group has posted much of the stolen malware on the web; North Korea’s hackers probably used the tools in their attack. In a ransomware attack, the victim’s files are encrypted, locking them out of their own computer systems, until they pay a ransom. Cybersecurity researchers estimate that criminals made more than $1 billion through these attacks last year, with victims ranging from the chief executives of major companies to small businesses and private individuals. While the motive for many ransomware attacks is financial, Russia’s involvement suggests it was part of a broader strategy to destabilize Ukraine that dates back to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.      The NotPetya attack originated in Ukraine, according to security researchers, apparently timed to strike a day before a holiday marking the 1996 adoption of Ukraine’s first constitution. It eventually spread to 64 countries, including Poland, Germany, Italy, and Russia itself. The administration’s action came as intelligence agencies warned that Russia was already meddling in the American midterm elections, using bots and other fake accounts on social media to spread disinformation. “We expect Russia to continue using propaganda, social media, false-flag personas, sympathetic spokespeople and other means of influence to try to exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States,” Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, told the Senate Intelligence Committee at its annual hearing on worldwide threats. “There should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 U.S. midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations,” Mr. Coats added.

NYTNow,433," By KAREN ZRAICK and SANDRA STEVENSONFEB. 16, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. He had a “desire to kill.” That’s what a tipster told the F.B.I. about Nikolas Cruz, the Florida school shooting suspect, last month. But the agency didn’t follow through on the tip. In an unusually sharp public rebuke of his own agents, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that the missed warnings had had “tragic consequences” and that “we must do better.” Gov. Rick Scott called for the bureau’s director, Christopher Wray, to resign. Funerals for some of the 17 victims in Parkland, Fla., have begun, while schools across the U.S. closed their doors or tightened security after threats or rumors of coming violence. Here’s the latest.  On “The Daily,” we discuss the AR-15, the weapon used in the attack. Originally designed for warfare, it’s now easier to buy than a handgun. ____ 2. Thirteen Russians and three Russian organizations have been indicted on charges of meddling in the 2016 presidential election.  It’s the first time that Robert Mueller, the special counsel in the Russia investigation, has filed charges for meddling. Above left, Yevgeny Prigozhin, one of Russia’s richest men and a close associate of Vladimir Putin. He’s among the accused. Here’s what we know about him. Prosecutors accuse the Russians of using social media to sow political discord — including actions that supported Donald Trump’s candidacy. Our White House correspondent writes that Mr. Mueller has “instantly created a new political reality for Mr. Trump.” ____ 3. In other Washington news, Mitt Romney, above center, declared that he’s running to represent Utah in the Senate. The Trump administration recommended stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. And an ex-Playboy model alleged that the publisher of The National Enquirer paid $150,000 for her account of a nine-month affair with President Trump — but never published the story. ____ 4. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, left, met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Relations between their countries have reached a crisis point, and the two leaders failed to resolve the conflict during a three-hour dinner in Ankara. They’re at odds over a Turkish military operation in Syria to dislodge Kurdish fighters allied with the U.S. Before Mr. Tillerson’s arrival, Mr. Erdogan had vowed to deliver an “Ottoman slap” to American forces if they stood in Turkey’s way.  ____ 5. A surprising new study found that petroleum-based chemicals used in perfumes, paints and other consumer products can emit as much air pollution as cars and trucks. That’s partly because vehicles are getting cleaner. But researchers found that 40 percent of the chemicals added to consumer products wind up in the air. Once released, they interact with other particles to create the building blocks of smog, which can trigger asthma and other health problems. ____ 6. In other environmental news, the Church of England is asking Anglicans to give up plastic for Lent. Many Christians give up indulgences like tobacco, alcohol or sweets, or transgressions like lying and swearing, for the six weeks of penance that begin on Ash Wednesday. The Anglican church says environmental stewardship is a core tenet of its teachings, and suggested that the faithful forgo plastic products and packaging. Above, litter in London. ____ 7. It’s also the Lunar New Year. Here’s our collection of recipes for the holiday, including crowd-pleasing “longevity noodles,” with chicken, ginger and mushrooms, above. In China, a skit on a TV special celebrating the holiday set off an uproar with caricatures featuring blackface and African men in animal suits.  The program is one of the most watched in the world, with an audience estimated at 800 million. The skit was intended to highlight relations between Africa and China. ____ 8. Lindsey Vonn, who has been called the world’s greatest skier, makes her Pyeongchang debut during Friday night’s Olympics broadcast. She’s among the favorites in the downhill and the super-G. Also airing tonight: the men’s figure skating finals. We have more on the three jumps that undid Nathan Chen’s hopes for gold, and the fitness secret behind Adam Rippon’s abs. Here’s the full Olympic medals table, results and schedule. ____ 9. We chatted with Salt Bae about how he spends his Sundays. That’s the Turkish restaurateur Nusret Gokce, who gained internet fame from a video of his flamboyant sprinkling of salt on a steak. He’s expanding his chain. The 35-year-old bachelor (with 13 children) is living at the Plaza Hotel, a short trip from his newest restaurant, Nusr-Et. ____ 10. Finally, HBO’s “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” begins its fifth season on Sunday. Mr. Oliver spoke to us about what’s coming this season, his efforts to “protect the main body of our show from being cannibalized” by the president, and his recent dust-up with Dustin Hoffman.

Washington,434," Supported by By Katie Rogers With a particular focus on social media, Melania Trump, the first lady, has long said she wants to curb online bullying and harassment as part of a nascent effort to improve the lives of American children. There’s one problem: Mrs. Trump’s efforts often clash with the president’s longtime habit of using social media to insult people.  Despite the criticism, she has continued to develop an agenda around cybersafety. On Tuesday, Mrs. Trump invited representatives from Facebook, Snap, Google, Amazon and Twitter to the White House for a round-table discussion on the topic. In a speech, she said that she had received letters from children who have been bullied or feel threatened on social media. “I am well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,” Mrs. Trump said on Tuesday. “I have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me from doing what I know is right. I am here with one goal: helping children and our next generation.”  So far, Mrs. Trump is working on this initiative independently of her husband. On Tuesday, President Trump had already attacked Democrats. Here are other times his behavior on Twitter has clashed with her public remarks on the importance of curbing bullying.  Days after visiting survivors of a mass school shooting in Parkland, Fla., Mrs. Trump addressed a group of governors’ spouses at the White House. She offered support for students who were protesting against current gun laws, and brought up social media exposure as one of the “evils in our world today.”  Mrs. Trump said adults should take responsibility for monitoring children’s behavior on social media. “Before you leave to go back to your wonderful states and territories, I’m asking you all to join me today and commit to promoting values such as encouragement, kindness, compassion and respect in our children,” Mrs. Trump said to the group. “With those values as a solid foundation, our kids will be better equipped to deal with many of the evils in our world today, such as drug abuse and addiction and negative social media interactions.”  That week, Mr. Trump singled out Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, the investigation led by the special counsel and the state of California.  Mrs. Trump, in another public indication that she may refocus on efforts related to an early promise to combat cyberbullying, visited a middle school in a Detroit suburb. In between posing for selfies, she urged students to treat one another with respect and kindness. “I encourage you to find a new friend and eat lunch with a new friend,” Mrs. Trump told a group of seventh- and eighth-grade students who had gathered in the cafeteria with their lunchboxes, backpacks and smartphones. “I think it’s very important to choose kindness and compassion.” That day, Mr. Trump attacked the National Football League in a continuing battle over players kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality, racism and the current state of the criminal justice system.  He also singled out the widow of a soldier killed in an ambush in Niger. Myeshia Johnson, whose husband, Sgt. La David T. Johnson, was killed, said the president had struggled to remember her husband’s name during a phone call. “The president said, ‘He knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyway,’” Ms. Johnson said during an interview with ABC News’s George Stephanopoulos. “It made me cry because I was very angry at the tone in his voice and how he said it.”  Mr. Trump used his preferred platform to hit back.  In a speech at a United Nations luncheon, Mrs. Trump warned about the dangers to children posed by cyberbullying and drugs. “We must turn our focus right now to the message and content they are exposed to on a daily basis through social media,” Mrs. Trump said to a luncheon group. “The bullying, the experience online and in person and the growing global epidemic of drug addiction and drug overdose.” That week, Mr. Trump criticized several targets, including the leader of North Korea, the Emmys and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.  During the president’s first trip abroad, Mrs. Trump met with Queen Mathilde of Belgium and watched a presentation about a program that advocates for missing and exploited children. Mrs. Trump emphasized the need for digital safety after the meeting.  “It is so important that we talk to children about their online activities, to let them know that computers are useful tools but can be used by people who want to harm them,” Mrs. Trump said in a statement released through the White House.  That week, the president was on his best Twitter behavior. He praised European leaders, called his meeting with Pope Francis “the honor of a lifetime” and discussed his poll numbers.  For the first time, Mrs. Trump said publicly that she wanted to help combat cyberbullying during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania.  “We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other. We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media,” Mrs. Trump said. “It will be one of the main focuses of my work if I’m privileged enough to become your first lady.”  Needless to say, her critics pounced. For his part, Mr. Trump spent the week railing against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and President Barack Obama.  On Tuesday, Carlos Monje, a representative from Twitter, the president’s preferred digital soapbox, said the platform worked hard to “create a safe environment” for people 13 and older. “Young people do come to Twitter to find community,” he said. Adding, “We’ve seen some pretty inspirational things.”  Over a year in the Trump presidency, the East Wing has not unveiled a formal policy initiative. On Tuesday, the East Wing did not give a timeline for a formal rollout. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the first lady, said in an email that it was common for the East Wing to work independently of the West Wing on “some issues.”  “It is, in fact, a huge part of life for children today and Mrs. Trump wants to use her platform to talk openly about how to use it in a positive way,” Ms. Grisham said. “Of course she knows there is going to be criticism, but she is an independent woman who is doing what she feels is right for children. This should be celebrated, not criticized.”  Kitty Bennett contributed research.

We’re gathering the stories of the 17 people killed in Wednesday’s mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. The police said a former student barged into the high school with a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle. It was by one count the 239th school shooting since Sandy Hook. The coach, Aaron Feiss, had himself graduated from the school. “I don’t know when Aaron’s funeral is,” the Broward County sheriff said. “I don’t know how many adults are going to go, but you’ll get 2,000 kids there.” ____ 2. “He always had guns on him.”  That was a former classmate of Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old charged with 17 counts of murder. A “troubled kid” who flaunted his firearms and bragged about killing animals, Mr. Cruz was expelled last year over erratic behavior that school administrators declined to describe.  The leader of a white supremacist group in Florida said Mr. Cruz was a member of his group and had participated in paramilitary drills.  ____ 3. “We are here for you — whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain.” In a televised speech addressing the shooting, President Trump pledged to work with state and local leaders to “tackle the difficult issue of mental health.” He did not mention gun control. It was a shift from his early-morning tweet, which some saw as victim-blaming: “So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!” ____ 4. No deal. Senators from both parties decisively turned back Mr. Trump’s immigration proposal, which would have instituted strict limits but helped the so-called Dreamers. The Senate also rejected two more modest measures. “What happens now,” our correspondent writes, “is unclear.” ____ 5. At $107 million, President Trump’s inauguration was the most expensive in history. And freshly released tax filings show that the nonprofit group that oversaw the event spent nearly all of the raised funds — leaving little to fulfill its pledge to donate richly to charities from leftover funds. The group also paid $26 million to a firm started by a senior adviser to the first lady, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, above, for event planning. ____ 6.  Nathan Chen of the U.S., above, and Japan’s star Yuzuru Hanyu are among those to watch today at the 2018 Winter Games. (In Chen’s free skate, he’ll dance to the story of “Mao’s Last Dancer,” the Chinese defector Li Cunxin — who is now the artistic director of the Queensland Ballet in Brisbane, Australia.)  One of our reporters described the Norwegian ski team’s recipe for success as “a contrarian mix of humility, egalitarianism and basic respect.” (They also spend about 250 days a year together — and sometimes even share beds.) Here’s the full medal count and schedule, and our complete coverage. ____ 7. Cyril Ramaphosa was sworn in as president of South Africa, a day after Jacob Zuma was ousted by his own party. Here’s our profile of Mr. Ramaphosa, a protégé of Nelson Mandela and now one of South Africa’s richest men. He vows to address gaping inequality and fight for the ordinary citizen. And the legacy of Mr. Zuma? Our Johannesburg bureau chief looks back at a nearly nine-year presidency marred by scandal, corruption and mismanagement. ____ 8. Investors fear that rising inflation in the U.S. could prompt a rise in interest rates, potentially crimping global growth. But as our columnist explains, the belief that a combination of inflation and higher interest rates is bad for stock prices could be proved otherwise. It’s unclear how the markets will react, but some experts are saying that stocks may continue to rally. Need a primer? Here’s how inflation works. ____ 9. Borneo’s orangutan population has dropped by about half over 16 years, according to a new study. Habitat loss was identified as a main cause, but hunting of the endangered animals appears to be surprisingly common. The team observed 36,555 nests and estimated a loss of 148,500 orangutans during that period.  “Worryingly, however, the largest number of orangutans were lost from areas that remained forested during the study period,” a researcher said. “This implies a large role of killing.” ____ 10. Before our national security reporter Scott Shane went into journalism, the C.I.A. tried to recruit him. But he chose “the better-lit side of democracy.” His essay on the parallels of journalism and espionage came ahead of his streamable chat from Washington tonight (6:30-8 p.m.) with the actress Jennifer Lawrence, who plays a Russian spy, above, in the new film “Red Sparrow.” The director, Francis Lawrence, joins them.

NYTNow,438," By ZACH JOHNK and DAVID SCULLFEB. 14, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Law enforcement officers descended on a high school in Parkland, Fla., where a shooting near dismissal time left at least 17 people dead. “Oh my God! Oh my God!” one student yelled over and over in a video circulating on social media, as more than 40 gunshots boomed in the background. A suspect, Nikolas Cruz, 19, who previously attended the school before he was expelled, was arrested about an hour after fleeing the scene, the authorities said. People who knew Mr. Cruz described him as a “troubled kid” who enjoyed showing off his firearms and whose mother would resort to calling the police to have them come to their home to try to talk some sense into him. _____ 2. A bipartisan group of senators reached an immigration agreement that would increase border security and resolve the fate of the young immigrants known as Dreamers.  But President Trump suggested he would veto any plan that does not adhere to his harder-line approach.  _____ 3. President Trump said he was “totally opposed to domestic violence,” in his first condemnation of the alleged conduct behind a scandal involving Rob Porter, the aide who resigned last week. Here’s our video profile of Mr. Porter, above right. John Kelly, above left, the president’s chief of staff, is facing new questions about his handling of the case, including why Mr. Porter worked without a permanent high-level security clearance for more than a year. Read our timeline of the scandal. _____ 4.  Jacob Zuma stepped down as South Africa’s president, ending a nine-year, scandal-plagued tenure after his own party repudiated him. It was a humiliating end for Mr. Zuma, a charismatic anti-apartheid hero who was imprisoned with Nelson Mandela. He initially inspired hope among South Africa’s poorest before coming to symbolize corruption. _____ 5. Also facing swirling accusations of corruption: Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister. He defiantly called a damning case against him “full of holes, like Swiss cheese,” and vowed to serve to the end of his term in late 2019. A police investigation found he should be charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. This is not the first time Mr. Netanyahu, above, has struggled with graft inquiries — nor is he the first Israeli leader to do so.  _____ 6. Mikaela Shiffrin, above, is set to — finally — make her debut at the Pyeongchang Olympics (high winds had forced delays in several Alpine skiing events). She’s a favorite in her first event, the giant slalom, but the compressed race schedule may take a toll. We also caught up with Lindsey Jacobellis, the snowboarder whose blunder at the 2006 Olympics cost her a gold medal. She has moved on quite spectacularly, our reporter John Branch writes, and is preparing to try again for that elusive gold. Sam Manchester, a Times sports editor, is on the ground in South Korea and sending messages to readers about what it’s like. Sign up here. You can find all of our coverage here. _____ 7. “One of the last great intact forests” in the world may stay that way.  Peru will protect millions of acres of roadless wilderness, creating a new national park. Above, a beaked toad. Angry about moves at the other end of the environmental spectrum in the U.S., and terrified of climate change, five activists are pushing the boundaries of civil disobedience. Read our story in The Times Magazine. _____ 8. The healthy food movement has been absorbed into the mainstream. But even as capitalism has ingeniously integrated the hippie culinary ideals of the 1960s, the big countercultural idea about food — that our eating has moral, ethical and political implications — remains potent, Michael Pollan writes in his review of “Hippie Food,” a book by Jonathan Kauffman. _____ 9. Chris Rock’s first new filmed hour in a decade, “Tamborine,” is now streaming on Netflix. Our reviewer calls it “triumphant.” “He has honed this material, beefing up jokes and cutting out fat,” the review says. “His comedy has become tighter, funnier if also slicker, shifting from a story of a comic struggling with demons to one describing how he once was lost and now he’s found.”  _____ 10. We’re popping the question: Just how powerful is love? Readers across the political spectrum told us how they’ve bridged the ever-widening partisan divide in their romantic lives. And whatever your relationship status, we invite you to check out our favorite Times coverage of love. The headline says it all: “Roses Are Red. That’s a Cliché. Here Is Your Guide to Valentine’s Day.” Have a great evening. _____ Get a nightly rundown of the day’s top stories, delivered to your inbox every Monday through Friday.

Opinion,439," Supported by Opinion By Susan Jacoby A framed eighth-grade diploma, dated June 19, 1913, hangs on the wall opposite my computer. It belonged to my grandmother, Minnie Rothenhoefer, one of eight children in a German immigrant family, who was forced to quit school at age 14 after her alcoholic father abandoned his family. Her first job was picking onions and her greatest regret — she lived to age 99 — was that she never attended high school. “But there’s no excuse for ignorance when you can go right down to the public library,” she often said. Gran has been in my thoughts even more than usual this year, because I know that she would have scoffed at one of the unanticipated consequences of the Trump presidency. I am referring to the endless self-flagellation among well-educated liberals — “the elites,” in pejorative parlance — about their failure to “get” the concerns of white working-class voters. Gran never expected anyone to “get” her. She was determined to educate herself for what she considered the privilege of citizenship. Our current political discourse is corrupted by two equally flawed narratives about the relationship between social class and politics. The first is a fable accepted by many intellectuals, who have found themselves guilty because just enough white working-class voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin handed Mr. Trump his Electoral College win in 2016. Many fear that this year’s midterm elections will once again result in a rejection of “elitism” by the same voters. In a second, equally flawed narrative — adopted by a segment of both blue-collar workers and intellectuals — the American working class is so victimized that almost none of its members are capable of accepting the responsibility of civic self-education. These narratives sometimes collide within families. On a trip to Detroit last spring, I met a professor of political science who seemed to believe that “elitist” obtuseness had lost Michigan for the Democrats. He told me that he felt responsible because his aunt and uncle — postal workers in suburban Macomb County — had voted Republican for the first time in their lives, mainly because they believed Mr. Trump’s false campaign assertion about New Jersey Muslims cheering the Sept. 11 attacks. He had been unable to convince them otherwise. Why should he feel guilty, I asked, if his relatives had chosen to ignore extensive evidence that the cheering never occurred? “I guess because I feel I ought to speak their language and I don’t,” he replied. I have frequently heard the phrase about not speaking “their” language from academics, journalists and political strategists. Here is a fact, not an alternative fact: Blue-collar workers speak English. Too many intellectuals have internalized a stereotype, emanating from both the far left and the far right, of fuzzy-headed elitism — as if willed ignorance and intellectual laziness did not cut across social classes. And some in the working class are just as animated by a stereotype of “elites” as people who look down on everyone without a doctorate. Self-denigration among the best educated is particularly harmful because it reinforces this belief. The day after the 2016 election, Joan C. Williams, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, wrote in Harvard Business Review that one of many things the “elites” don’t understand about the working class is that the latter “resents professionals but admires the rich.” The author meant to criticize “elitists,” but her generalization presents a distorted view of the working class. Some working-class Americans resent some professionals — say, lawyers for slumlords or doctors who won’t treat Medicaid and Medicare patients. But there are surely just as many with an outsize respect for professionals — especially if the professional happens to be their own doctor or their child’s favorite teacher. The energy expended by many “elitists” on constructing tortuous apologies for their advantages would be better invested in sharing the fruits of those advantages. While some studies have indicated that people cling even more strongly to their deepest beliefs when challenged by contradictory evidence, it is also true that human beings frequently do change their minds — about everything from sexual behavior to marijuana to gun laws — if they are treated respectfully by those presenting the evidence. One of the greatest compliments I have ever received came from a Latino student at Youngstown State University, in an Ohio city often cited as an example of Rust Belt decay. This American-born son of immigrants was working three jobs to pay his tuition. He said that he had taken my remarks about the importance of liberal arts seriously, even though he had previously considered such knowledge irrelevant to his goal of becoming a math teacher. When I asked why my comments had persuaded him to reconsider, he replied that he was pleased when I began my talk with the words “ladies and gentlemen.” He added, “When I’m teaching, I’m going to open all of my classes with ‘ladies and gentlemen.’ It’ll tell the kids what’s expected of them.” There is an aspirational hunger in many young people that highly educated Americans can help satisfy — but only by being themselves instead of pretending to be “ordinary folks.”  The American dream has never been about denigrating education but about seeing that the next generation has greater access to learning. Who is in a better position to help Americans who want that chance than those who already benefited from the generous side of the dream? The “elites” should take practical steps to persuade others not by hectoring them but by working to better the quality of life for all. First, intellectuals must speak up, not down, to everyone. Americans remember public addresses like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech precisely because he spoke in elevated English. You won’t find him referring to “folks” anywhere in that speech. Second, educators must help turn students into educated voters. Too many schools fail to provide students with tools of logic that would enable them to assess the quality of information they absorb from every screen. All schools, for example, should have a curriculum that teaches children how to evaluate online information. Most recently, we have seen the results of this type of education in the forceful, logical responses of student survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Finally, those who have profited from the best schooling our society has to offer must fight to make college more affordable for others. The working-class students I have met — unlike Republicans in a much-cited 2017 Pew poll — know that college has a positive, not a negative, effect on their future. They base their actions on reality rather than ideology, and the reality is that the pay gap between the college-educated and all other Americans is at a historic high. As I write, I am looking at my grandmother’s diploma. She left it to me in her will as evidence of a life in which I never saw her alone without a book or newspaper in hand. That is positive elitism — embodying the pursuit of excellence rather than money or credentials — for which no one need apologize and to which anyone can aspire.

Culture,440," Supported by By Jon Pareles, Jon Caramanica and Giovanni Russonello Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos — and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. This week, a protest song from Willie Nelson, a few unwise words from Chris Brown and a St. Patrick’s Day surprise from the Gloaming. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. For about 40 seconds at the beginning of “Can’t Deny Me,” the first original new Pearl Jam song in five years, the band is downright itchy — Eddie Vedder trades the messianic for the agitated, the guitars are a little arrogantly lazy, the drumming is filthy. It’s bracing, a nervy and grounded protest from a band that ordinarily prefers to soar. (Pearl Jam dedicated its live performance debut of this song to the students affected by the Parkland, Fla. school shooting.) But then something like a melody arrives, and the song begins to resolve itself into something clean, plaintive, not nervous at all. A shame. JON CARAMANICA Willie Nelson’s resilience is one of this country’s most powerful natural resources. At 84, he is as puckish as ever — a flirt and a scoundrel. The charming, vital “Me and You,” a new track from Mr. Nelson’s forthcoming album “Last Man Standing,” is a protest song masquerading as a serenade. “We are definitely outnumbered/There’s more of them than us,” he sings. But never fear — reassurance is just around the corner: “The world has gone out of its mind except for me and you.” J.C. “Ventriloquism,” Meshell Ndegeocello’s new LP, is a woozy tour through the R&B of the 1980s and ’90s. It’s also a showcase of the manifold territory that is her style: There’s acoustic balladry, sighing neo-soul, and dance grooves that start in the hips and swirl into the head like an intoxicant. Ms. Ndegeocello practices a coy and unperformative form of seduction — her impenetrability is her sensuality. So it’s no surprise that she takes well to “Private Dancer,” Tina Turner’s coldly steaming ballad about sex work and isolation. Moving through the melody like a lone figure through a fog, Ms. Ndegeocello lends a reticent dignity to the song’s lament. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Clever enough to be funny and provocative but not smart enough to anticipate the think pieces it’ll engender (if people bother to pay attention), the new single from Lil Dicky and Chris Brown delivers a progressive premise in reductive garb. In the song and video, the two performers trade bodies. Mr. Brown sings the first half as Lil Dicky, puerile as they come, and Lil Dicky raps the second half as Mr. Brown, alluding to his criminal history and alleged gang ties. But it’s the first half, with Mr. Brown enthusiastically singing wish fulfillment for Lil Dicky, that’s most vexing, especially when he thrills at his ability to safely use the one word a white person should not: “Wonder if I can say the N-word/Wait, can I really say the N-word?” And then he does. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And then, once more. J.C. The improvising saxophonist and avant-garde maestro John Zorn is about to release “The Book Beriah,” the third and final installment of “Masada,” his 613-piece epic based on the Torah’s commandments. This book stretches across 92 tunes and 11 CDs, each disc featuring a different ensemble. Mr. Zorn’s way of presenting “Masada” — a project he first introduced 25 years ago — submits the material fully to the yens of its many performers. He is deliberately skipping a step, nudging back against the idea that a major work establishes its identity through some standard-setting recording. (These “Beriah” pieces have been in circulation onstage since 2014.) On Disc 3, the Spike Orchestra fuses klezmer with surf rock in an oddly resonant admixture, run through the apparatus of a jazz big band. On Disc 7, the Gnostic Trio (harp, guitar, vibraphone) elevates and aerates Mr. Zorn’s cyclical compositions. And in the beginning, on Disc 1, the Argentine vocalist Sofía Rei sings in a declaratory gale over the eight-string SazBass of J.C. Maillard. G.R. An alluring dance song by Kitty (formerly Kitty Pryde) that channels the Latin freestyle of the late 1980s. (This is maybe a trendlet in the making — see also SOBxRBE’s recent “Carpoolin’.”) The aura is synthetic and the emotion is confidently cool. J.C. As bachateros go, Prince Royce is versatile, a singer who embraces a real range of music, from classic ballads to chintzy pop to street-friendly trap and reggaeton. “El Clavo” is, spiritually, a blend of several of these directions — a slow thumper with a light melody and an urgent sentiment (your man is terrible to you; I am better than your man). J.C. Dreamlike and lightly whimsical tough talk from the rising rapper Lil Mosey that sets itself apart from SoundCloud rap peers thanks to a cheerful sense of melody and high-test, shimmering, pop-minded production by Royce David. J.C. Kurt Elling has covered Paul Simon’s “American Tune” before, as a piano-vocal duet on “1619 Broadway: The Brill Building Project,” but on his forthcoming album, “The Questions,” he sinks into the song more completely. With a full band this time, he sings in a warm-ember baritone over wafted horn harmonies, seeking to reconcile Mr. Simon’s devotional patriotism with a contemporary drive toward action. In this new music video, clips of recent protests mingle with black-and-white factory footage. It’s broad-strokes idealism, soft at the center and deliberately unspecific, but what saves it is Mr. Elling’s voice: bright, devout and earnest. G.R. St. Patrick’s Day is not popularly associated with introspection, but try it with a song from the new live album by the Gloaming, a group steeped in Irish tradition that carries the music into pensive, even mystical realms, particularly when Thomas Bartlett’s piano transmutes the harmonies. “The Sailor’s Bonnet,” a reel that might have just been a foot-stomper, becomes an odyssey of storm, struggle and completion.

NYTNow,441," By KAREN ZRAICK and SANDRA STEVENSONMARCH 15, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Easter Island is eroding. Located 2,200 miles off the coast of Chile, the island is one of the most remote inhabited places on Earth. Its ancient stone heads attract tourists from around the world. Archaeologists fear rising sea levels, storms and flooding could erase clues to the statues’ great mystery: What caused the collapse of the civilization that built them? ____ 2. The Trump administration accused Moscow of engineering a series of escalating cyberattacks that could have enabled it to shut off American and European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems. Above, a power plant in Brooklyn.  And the White House issued new sanctions, its toughest action so far against Russia, for election interference and other “malicious” cyberattacks.  The U.S. also joined European countries in denouncing Russia over an attack on a former spy, which used a terrifyingly powerful, military-grade nerve agent on British soil. Separately, the special counsel, Robert Mueller, subpoenaed business records from the Trump Organization — including some related to Russia. ____ 3. President Trump repeated his false assertion that the U.S. runs a trade deficit with Canada. By his own account, he’s even insisted on that claim, without knowing whether it was true, to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s face. Above, the two leaders and their wives last year. On a different Canadian topic, our Montreal-born correspondent, Dan Bilefsky, has been spending the week on a road trip around Quebec. Here’s his conversation with a chef who is reclaiming indigenous culinary traditions. Dan’s also looking for young people to tell him about the highlights and challenges of life in Quebec. Share your ideas here. ____ 4. It’s the seventh anniversary of the start of the Syrian uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. We spoke to a Syrian-American architect from Aleppo, Lina Sergie Attar, above, about losing her city in the gruesome civil war. She focused on the future.  “Rebuilding is a part of human nature,” she said. “I hope, as an architect, that Aleppo will be rebuilt in a way that honors the memory of what has happened there.” Watch the video here. ____ 5. A recently installed pedestrian bridge at Florida International University collapsed onto a busy Miami road, crushing cars beneath it. The authorities said there were five or six vehicles underneath the bridge, and several people were killed. Check back for updates on this developing story. ____ 6. A sister of Dylann Roof, the man who massacred nine black churchgoers in South Carolina in 2015, was arrested for bringing weapons to school on the day of a nationwide student walkout. In a Snapchat post, Morgan Roof, above, said she hoped the student protesters would “get shot.” In Parkland, Fla., the authorities released surveillance video showing that the only armed guard at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School took cover behind a wall during the massacre. On “The Daily,” we discuss the gun control laws that Florida — often called “the Gunshine State” — passed after the shooting. ____ 7. March Madness is here. The best offense? Villanova. The best defense? Cincinnati. Here’s a look at the N.C.A.A. tournament teams by the numbers. Among the spectators: Sister Jean, a 98-year-old nun who serves as the team chaplain for Loyola-Chicago. Her prayers are anything but bipartisan.  ____ 8. Next in our new obituary series, Overlooked: Alison Hargreaves, above, who in 1995 became the first woman in history to scale Mount Everest alone and without bottled oxygen. When she died three months later climbing another peak, K2, she was called a selfish mom. Fathers who died on the mountain alongside her didn’t hear such harsh criticism. We created Overlooked because of the glaring absence of notable women and men of color from our obituary pages. To begin, we tried to show how the gender breakdown had changed over time. That turned out to be a project unto itself. Our editor explains why. ____ 9. “I don’t make history, I am history.” That was Joan Baez, the legendary folk singer and activist, above, who just released what she said will be her last album, “Whistle Down the Wind.” Baez, 77, is on an eight-month international tour that she intends as her farewell to the road. “Perhaps there is virtue to having carried the flame,” she told our reporter. “And grace now in passing the torch.” ____ 10. Finally, a March 7 correction on a trade policy article was probably the strangest one we’ve ever published. The article referred to the 2008 recession as “the Time of Shedding and Cold Rocks.” The editor was using a satirical text-swapping browser extension called “Millenials to Snake People,” which inserted the phrase without him realizing it. Here, he explains how it happened, and how you too, can install one of these delightful extensions. (Just remember to disable it when you’re editing a news article.)

NYTNow,442," By CHARLES McDERMID and DAVID SCULLMARCH 13, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Rex Tillerson apparently learned of his dismissal by being shown President Trump’s tweet naming Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, as secretary of state. Mr. Pompeo opposes the Iran nuclear deal and doubts that talks will persuade North Korea to give up its nukes. The Senate must confirm his appointment, as well as that of his replacement. Gina Haspel, his current deputy, would be the first woman to head the C.I.A. She has had a leading role in the torture of detainees. More turnover: Mr. Trump’s personal assistant was forced out over security issues, and a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement resigned, saying he could no longer spread lies for the Trump administration. _____ 2. President Trump is visiting what the White House presumably views as enemy territory: California.  Mr. Trump flew into San Diego, where he inspected prototypes of a border wall being built along the Mexican border, above, before speaking to troops at a military base. From there, he is heading to Beverly Hills for a high-roller Republican fund-raiser.  Protesters — and some supporters — are planning rallies. A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department said, “We are prepared for anything that arises.” _____ 3. How young is too young to protest? That’s what educators are asking — and deciding — across the U.S. as they prepare for what organizers call the National School Walkout in protest of gun violence. Above, a fifth-grade student in Akron, Ohio, holds the name of a victim of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Many districts and schools are tolerating, if not encouraging, participation, but they’re also enforcing age limits. In New York City, middle and high school students may walk out of class with parental approval, but elementary school students may not unless a parent or guardian is with them. _____ 4. Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District voted on who would replace Tim Murphy, a Republican who resigned last year after reports he encouraged a woman with whom he had an affair to have an abortion. But the race was too close to call early Wednesday. Conor Lamb, a moderate Democrat, led by 579 votes over Rick Saccone, a Republican lawmaker and Trump ally, with a few thousand absentee ballots still to count. The race became an acid test for the allegiance of working-class voters, attracting millions of dollars from Republican “super PACs” and from small-donor Democrats across the country. Above, Saccone supporters in Elizabeth, Pa.  _____ 5. “It’s like allowing someone to walk on the wing of an airplane.” That’s how an aviation lawyer spoke of rides on doorless helicopters, like the one above before it crashed into the East River on Sunday night, killing five, the deadliest such accident in New York City since 2009. Aviation experts point to startling safety gaps in the fast-growing industry of doors-off photo flights, once reserved for professional photographers but increasingly booked by tourists looking to share stomach-churning pictures on Instagram. Investigators are trying to determine the cause of the crash, why pontoons did not keep the helicopter from flipping over and sinking and whether the pilot could have done anything for the passengers afterward. _____ 6. “Nonsense.” That’s what Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, above, called Britain’s allegation that Moscow was to blame for the poisoning by nerve agent of a former Russian spy-turned-double agent. The dismissal came after Prime Minister Theresa May said it was “highly likely” that Russia was behind the poisoning of the former spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter. Russia now has more intelligence agents deployed in London than at the height of the Cold War. Our correspondent spoke to some of the powerful expatriate Russians they watch. _____ 7. Chilean grapes. Mexican berries. Vietnamese dragon fruit. As it stands, more than half of the fresh fruit and almost one-third of the fresh vegetables Americans buy now come from other countries. Is that a bad thing? Our food team tracks how it happened and examines the pros and cons for farmers and consumers. _____ 8. Trade wars can resemble a game of chicken. (Sometimes, our columnist writes, they even involve chickens.)  As pundits fret about how countries might retaliate against President Trump’s tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, our reporters in China note that it has already moved away from exporting sheets of steel or chunks of aluminum. In fact, Beijing is forcing many Chinese companies to close wasteful, polluting factories to fix its economy and clean up its skies. Above, an aluminum-sided F-150 rolls off the assembly line in Dearborn, Mich. _____ 9. March Madness is upon us.  Every team in the field, from the favorites to the No. 16 seeds, has its strengths and weaknesses — but this year a few really stand out. Our sports department put together the best and worst of the men’s N.C.A.A. basketball tournament. (Spoilers: Michigan State does it all, and Villanova, with guard Phil Booth, above, isn’t bad either.) Here is another look at experts’ predictions, and six bracket busters. The bracket for the women’s tournament is here. _____ 10. Finally, here’s a television appearance our Watching team is excited about. David Byrne, above, the onetime Talking Heads frontman and experimental musician who just released his first solo album in 14 years, appears on “The Daily Show” tonight. Our reporter calls the album, “American Utopia,” a “forlorn, hilarious portrait” of the country. Mr. Byrne himself says it portrays “who we are, who we hope to be, all this kind of thing.” Have a great night.

TStyle,443," Supported by By John Wogan Surrounded by the Baltic Sea, about 60 miles off the southeastern coast of Sweden’s mainland, Gotland is the largest of the country’s bucolic islands (which number well over 200,000), and one that has a seemingly split personality. In the short summer season — primarily July and August, when temperatures hover in the balmy 70s — revelers descend on this mostly wild, windswept and sparsely populated province for all-night partying and the rambunctious weeklong electronic music festival Stockholmsveckan. Outside of high season, though — and anywhere outside of its largest town, Visby (population: 24,300) — Gotland remains a rural paradise, popular with outdoorsy Stockholm professionals looking to escape city life by hiking along the island’s craggy limestone cliffs and cycling past tiny clapboard fishing villages, crumbling medieval churches and 18th-century farmhouses. Several Stockholm-based architects have even chosen to build their own startlingly contemporary houses on the tradition-bound island. Lately, Gotland has been attracting a growing stream of international visitors, too. Chalk it up to gloomy political and environmental forecasts if you will, but as travelers increasingly seek out pristine landscapes offering peace and quiet, the island presents the perfect retreat — just a 40-minute flight from Stockholm. Design-forward boutique hotels offer access to nature that doesn’t require pitching a tent in the wilderness, and a clutch of remarkably good restaurants — serving fresh-caught Baltic fish and all manner of organic locally grown vegetables — show off the bounty of the surrounding farmland. Throw in a few charming craft-oriented Nordic design shops and an impressively large collection of museums for an island with a population of just 60,000, and you have a compelling reason to skip the mainland entirely. Hotel Stelor Staying at this tiny, six-room hotel in rural Vastergarn village (about a 20-minute drive south of central Visby) feels like being a guest at a family friend’s country compound. The wood-beamed interiors of the 18th-century farmhouse are endlessly photogenic, decorated with pastel floral wallpaper, sheepskin throw rugs and jugs of freshly picked wildflowers. During the summer, there are live folk music performances in the property’s barn, and the traditionally Swedish restaurant — which uses produce from the hotel’s own two-acre garden — is considered one of the best on Gotland. Fabriken Furillen An imposing former factory building on the site of an old limestone quarry might not sound particularly inviting, but photographer Johan Hellstrom had a vision for what it could become, and he turned this industrial patch of land into a high-end escape (about an hour’s drive northeast of Visby) after purchasing the abandoned factory in 1999. The 19 guest rooms all have Hastens beds and a color scheme dominated by soothing grays and white, so there’s nothing to detract from the natural, forested surroundings. For those who really want to detach, there’s a “Hermit Cabin” on the grounds — an isolated outpost (a 20-minute bike ride from the main building) with no running water, no Wi-Fi and free-roaming cows and sheep as your only neighbors. Revolver Hotel Tucked into a quiet courtyard in central Visby, the three-year-old Revolver is an under-the-radar hotel option in Gotland’s main town — there’s no website and no outside signage, so word of mouth has been the main driver for bookings here. Quirky décor dominates — think sparkly golden bathroom tiles, vintage rotary phones as objets d’art, and Fornasetti wallpaper depicting hot air balloons — all of it the singular vision of its owner, the conceptual designer Ingela Tanaka Rohnstrom. There’s no restaurant, but the hotel is within walking distance of the main commercial blocks of Visby, and three of the nine guest rooms have a full kitchen and living room. 011-46-70-639-39-01  Bakfickan In central Visby, the island’s premier seafood restaurant is a no-frills rustic dining room, filled with mismatched wooden chairs and vintage fish prints, that’s usually packed — no reservations accepted. The day’s specials are written on a chalkboard at the entrance and often include baked perch with celeriac and truffle vinaigrette, lobster soup with black radish, and fried herring with spring onion butter and mashed potatoes. In warm weather, simple wooden tables are set up on the street outside — the ideal place to sip a glass of Chardonnay and watch the summer crowds pass by.  Krakas Krog A 40-minute drive east across Gotland from Visby brings you to this hybrid restaurant and hotel in the middle of the Kräklingbo countryside. There’s a highly seasonal tasting menu of six to eight courses — regular ingredients include grilled beetroot, local lamb, and frogs’ legs sourced from the nearby pond — all presented by one of the cooks in the spare, minimalist dining room. And with only one seating a night, there’s a sense of special occasion that permeates dinners here. The three guest rooms are similarly simple and refined, all in varying shades of white, with wide-plank wood floors and fluffy down comforters.  Lilla Bjers This 30-acre family-run farm on the outskirts of Visby is surrounded by vegetable fields and fruit orchards, from which it sources the ingredients for its organic, constantly changing menu. Everything from blueberries and currants to garlic and nine varieties of asparagus, as well as Christmas trees, are grown on the property. Dishes are a simple affair — think roasted lamb with pickled carrots and potatoes pulled straight from the earth — and a walk around the grounds before a meal is the best way to fully appreciate what you’re about to eat. You can even meet the chickens that supply the kitchen’s eggs. Dinner in the farm’s atmospheric greenhouse can also be arranged, where you’ll dine amid banana, fig and olive trees.  C. Jensen Keramik   The ubiquity of Nordic design extends to Gotland, where the ceramist Camilla Jensen occupies a studio-cum-store selling her delicate, artfully imperfect handmade stone and porcelain tableware, most in pristine shades of white or jet black. The space itself, in central Visby — all whitewashed walls and pale linen finishings — is reminiscent of an art gallery. On the building’s lower level, Jensen also sells a small selection of home items (textiles, rugs, woven baskets), primarily sourced from India, where she travels every year.  Toftalagret In the medieval coastal town of Tofta, you’ll find an extension of Visby’s Revolver Hotel (which lies about 15 minutes to the north). Here, the hotel’s owner, Ingela Tanaka, and her partner Lena Herrmann, who runs the shop, have created another home for Tanaka’s vast assortment of design and fashion finds, collected over decades. There’s a whole room of vintage clothing (including original Levi’s and Lee denim, wedding dresses and unusual sneakers), bicycles from the 1960s, kitschy decorative items like porcelain parrots, vinyl records and an array of giftable local items (Swedish candy, homemade soaps, specialty loose-leaf teas and herbs). 011-07-63-94-24-44   Visby Botanical Garden A verdant expanse of parkland near the shoreline, Visby’s 150-year-old botanical garden is the place to be on warm summer afternoons — for a picnic lunch or to stroll the garden’s 60 acres while taking a closer look at the magnolia, tulips, cedar and sequoia trees. Be sure to explore the ivy-shrouded ruins of St. Olaf, a former church from the 13th century, whose gray stone structure still stands on the southern edge of the park.  Gotland Fornsalen The Gotland Museum comprises seven different structures scattered throughout Visby, but its main building, Fornsalen (housed in a former 18th-century distillery) is dedicated to the culture and history of the island, with a collection that spans roughly 8,000 years. Here, you’ll find everything from the mummified remains of Stone Age islanders to medieval armor from the Danish invasion of 1361. It’s a deep dive into Gotland’s rugged, seafaring culture and why the island holds such a special place in the Swedish imagination.

Culture,444," By THOMAS ROGERSMARCH 13, 2018 OSLO — On July 22, 2011, the Norwegian filmmaker Erik Poppe was driving home to Oslo from southern Norway when he got a phone call from a panicked assistant. His employee, he recalled, said that a bomb had exploded near Mr. Poppe’s office, in the center of the Norwegian capital. Although it wouldn’t become clear until later, a right-wing extremist called Anders Behring Breivik had set off a car bomb in the city’s government quarter, killing eight. That evening, Mr. Poppe said, he followed in horror as news broke of a further attack — a mass shooting at the Norwegian Labor Party’s summer youth camp on the island of Utoya, about 19 miles northwest of Oslo. Disguised as a police officer, Mr. Breivik had murdered 69 people and injured many more, almost all teenagers, before giving himself up when the security forces arrived. “We were sitting there, completely in shock,” Mr. Poppe said. “It wasn’t just an attack on those kids on the island, or the victims downtown, but also an attack on our democracy.” Six and a half years later, Mr. Poppe, one of Norway’s best-known directors, has channeled his outrage into a film, “U — July 22,” the first cinematic depiction of the attack. The movie, which opened in Norway on Friday, has prompted a wider debate about the ethics of fictionalizing the traumatic event.  After its premiere in February at the Berlin International Film Festival, where it played in competition and screened just days after the shooting in Parkland, Fla., in which 17 people were killed, the movie also spurred a discussion about gun control and about the dangers of right-wing extremism. Two other movies and a television series about the attacks are currently in the works, including a film for Netflix helmed by Paul Greengrass, the director of “United 93.”  Norway has struggled in recent years to pay tribute to victims of the attack. A planned memorial near Utoya was canceled after public complaints, and many have argued that the media’s focus on Mr. Breivik, who has filed complaints about his treatment in prison and recently changed his name to Fjotolf Hansen, has taken attention away from the victims. “I realized there should be a story from the young people’s perspectives entirely, that brings that into our collective memory again,” Mr. Poppe said. “U — July 22” is a rigorously faithful reconstruction of the events on the island. It closely follows a fictional 19-year-old named Kaja (Andrea Berntzen), who is separated from her younger sister when the attack begins, and is forced to scramble for shelter — in a small building, among trees and along the island’s rocky shoreline — as others are murdered around her. In an impressive technical feat, the 90-minute film was recorded in one take, with two invisible cuts to hide geographical differences between Utoya and the neighboring island on which it was filmed. When Mr. Poppe first approached the national support group for victims of the July 22 attacks about his plans to make a film, some members of the group voiced concerns that not enough time had passed. “We were worried it might be too early, because many people want to shield themselves,” said Lisbeth Royneland, the chair of the group’s board. One mother of a victim, Mr. Poppe recalled, offered him a stern warning about depicting anything beyond what really happened. “She said, ‘If you make it about something else — love, hope — I will never, ever, ever forgive you. I will hunt you down,’ ” he said. But after Mr. Poppe explained his plans for a pared-down film focused on the victims, the group’s leaders gave their blessing. Mr. Poppe’s decision to make the film has been heavily debated in the Norwegian media. In an article last summer for the website of NRK, the national broadcaster, one survivor accused Mr. Poppe of “turning my life’s nightmare into popular entertainment” and argued that Norwegians should instead be discussing the spread of Mr. Breivik’s ideology. Mr. Poppe said that he could not argue with survivors’ personal feelings but that he believed that in an era of rising right-wing populism across Europe and in the rest of the Western world, he felt it was especially important to show the consequences of extremist ideology.      In preparing the film, Mr. Poppe and his team conducted interviews with over 40 survivors and incorporated their experiences into the script. One scene in which Kaja sings Cyndi Lauper’s “True Colors” to calm down other hiding youths, for instance, replicates a real moment on the island, even down to the song. Mr. Poppe and his team filmed with a cast of amateur actors over five days in September last year, using loudspeakers to replicate the exact number of shots fired by Mr. Breivik. The speakers, he said, were turned away from the shoreline to avoid traumatizing neighbors, and several survivors were on set to ensure the film’s accuracy. Mr. Poppe, who has previously worked as a war photographer, also partly drew on his experience working in conflict areas like Afghanistan.  To get the role of Kaja, Ms. Berntzen — a 20-year-old whose only previous acting experience had been in high school theatrical revues — had to undergo eight auditions and a psychiatric evaluation. And to maintain secrecy, she was only told midway through the process what the film was actually about. “I remember thinking I should be happy if I don’t get a role,” she said in an interview, referring to the unusual approach. But when Mr. Poppe explained his ideas and motives, she was convinced, she said. “A whole generation is being born now for which July 22 is becoming as distant as World War II,” Ms. Berntzen added. “That’s why it’s important to have this movie.” The reaction to the film in Norway has been generally positive, with a strong performance at the box office and many critics praising its intensity and faithfulness to the events. One writer in the newspaper Dagbladet, however, argued that the film lacked any interest in exploring a bigger “problem or tension,” and complained that it “is more interested in reproducing history than adding anything to it.” Before the movie’s Berlin premiere, the filmmakers held screenings for the survivors and relatives across the country. Renate Tarnes, now the secretary general of the Labor Party’s youth organization, who survived the shooting by hiding in a cafe on the island, said that when she saw the film, her first reaction was “relief, because I really felt he and his crew understood what we’ve been through.” Afterward, she texted Mr. Poppe to say that she had “been really skeptical, that I didn’t think it was possible to do it in a good way.” But the director, she said, “surprised me.”  ",2018-03-13,0.0013872182,Tuesday
NYTNow,445," By CHRIS STANFORDMARCH 15, 2018  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Two months after four U.S. soldiers were killed in Niger, a group of Green Berets and local forces killed 11 Islamic State militants in a previously undisclosed battle. No American or Nigerien forces were harmed in the fight in December. But it indicates that the deadly Oct. 4 ambush was not an isolated episode in the West African nation, where the U.S. is building a major drone base. • Wednesday’s news follows the revelation last week that the U.S. carried out four airstrikes in Libya between September and January that Africa Command failed to disclose at the time. • A razor-thin victory in a special House election in Pennsylvania has given Democrats hope for this fall’s elections in districts that voted heavily for Donald Trump.  The winner, Conor Lamb, presented himself as independent-minded, vowing early that he would not support Nancy Pelosi to lead the House Democrats. His approach could become a template for moderate Democrats seeking seats in conservative-leaning areas.  • Speaking to voters, our reporter learned that, while anti-Trump motivation is abundant, candidates still matter in close races. • Thousands of students walked out of schools across the U.S. on Wednesday as part of a coordinated protest calling for gun control. The walkouts generally lasted for 17 minutes, one for every victim in last month’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Here are photos from around the country. • Although the protests commanded attention on TV and social media, it was clear that many students did not participate, especially in rural and conservative areas where gun control is not popular. High school students across the United States left their classrooms on Wednesday morning to draw attention to gun violence in schools. • Britain wants the support of its allies in taking action against Moscow after a nerve-agent attack against a former spy. But Prime Minister Theresa May — who expelled 23 Russian diplomats on Wednesday — leads a country whose position in the world has weakened, and it’s uncertain how much help she’ll get. She does have the backing of Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., who called the poisoning “an atrocious crime” during an emergency session of the Security Council.  • As part of Britain’s retaliatory measures, no ministers or royals will attend the World Cup in Russia this summer. • The remote Pacific island is critically vulnerable to rising sea levels. Two Times journalists traveled 2,200 miles off the coast of Chile to see how the ocean is erasing famous ancient monuments. • Archaeologists fear losing clues to one of the island’s great mysteries: What caused the collapse of the civilization that built the statues? Florida is a friendly place for gun owners, and the N.R.A. and lawmakers have often blocked proposed restrictions. What changed after the Parkland shooting? • The Senate, in a rare show of bipartisanship, voted to ease some rules imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. But Republicans in the House are expected to push for a much more expansive rollback of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. • From cable to the White House: Larry Kudlow, a CNBC television pundit, will become President Trump’s top economic adviser, replacing Gary Cohn. Larry Kudlow, a CNBC television commentator and longtime cheerleader of President Trump, will replace Gary D. Cohn, who resigned over the president’s trade policies. • Elizabeth Holmes, once a favorite of Silicon Valley, has been charged with fraud. She had captivated investors and the public with her company, Theranos, which promised that a simple blood test could detect a range of illnesses, from diabetes to cancer. • There will be no more Toys “R” Us kids. The retail chain is closing its U.S. stores. • U.S. stocks were down on Wednesday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today. Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • Protect a laptop after it’s been stolen. • For heart disease patients, think exercise, not weight loss.  • Recipe of the day: Chicken and rice is a glorious one-pot weeknight meal. • Stephen Hawking taught us how to live “Whether or not he overturned the universe, he did overturn our imaginations.” One of our science reporters appraised the extraordinary life of the English cosmologist, who died on Wednesday. Here’s a brief history of Dr. Hawking’s work, six cultural moments he inspired and some of his most memorable quotations. • Cyberattack with a deadly goal In August, the hacking of a petrochemical company with a plant in Saudi Arabia was intended not just to destroy data or force a shutdown, investigators say. It was also meant to sabotage the firm’s operations and cause an explosion. • Is your bracket ready?  The N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament begins today. We looked at the best and worst on the court, the myths of March Madness and the 98-year-old nun who is in the huddle with Loyola University-Chicago. • Mayor watched a dance recital. Now he’s the ex-mayor. The mayor of Tehran resigned after attending a celebration where six girls danced and threw rose petals in honor of a female saint.  Women are not allowed to dance in public in Iran — and girls older than 9 are regarded as women by clerics.

Why does this keep happening?” — Kaylee Tyner, a 16-year-old who joined a gun-violence walkout at Columbine High School in Colorado, where 13 people were killed in 1999. • The Times, in other words Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. “The Godfather,” which opened in New York on this day in 1972, was “one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment,” the Times film critic Vincent Canby wrote. The adaptation of Mario Puzo’s best-selling 1969 novel was directed by a young Francis Ford Coppola. He was selected after numerous other directors turned down the job, and in part for his Italian heritage. The saga of the Corleones, an organized crime family in New York in the 1940s and ’50s, “The Godfather” became an almost-instant classic. It was the top-earning film of 1972 and remains one of the highest-grossing (and most critically acclaimed) movies of all time.  Nominated for 10 Academy Awards in 1973, “The Godfather” won three, including best picture and best actor for Marlon Brando, who played Vito Corleone, the family’s aging patriarch. Brando famously declined to accept the award as a protest of Hollywood’s portrayal of Native Americans. “The Godfather” was “a superb Hollywood movie,” Canby wrote in 1972, “scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn’t (or, at least, shouldn’t) pay.” _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

Opinion,447," Supported by By Zeynep Tufekci At one point during the 2016 presidential election campaign, I watched a bunch of videos of Donald Trump rallies on YouTube. I was writing an article about his appeal to his voter base and wanted to confirm a few quotations. Soon I noticed something peculiar. YouTube started to recommend and “autoplay” videos for me that featured white supremacist rants, Holocaust denials and other disturbing content. Since I was not in the habit of watching extreme right-wing fare on YouTube, I was curious whether this was an exclusively right-wing phenomenon. So I created another YouTube account and started watching videos of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, letting YouTube’s recommender algorithm take me wherever it would. Before long, I was being directed to videos of a leftish conspiratorial cast, including arguments about the existence of secret government agencies and allegations that the United States government was behind the attacks of Sept. 11. As with the Trump videos, YouTube was recommending content that was more and more extreme than the mainstream political fare I had started with. Intrigued, I experimented with nonpolitical topics. The same basic pattern emerged. Videos about vegetarianism led to videos about veganism. Videos about jogging led to videos about running ultramarathons. It seems as if you are never “hard core” enough for YouTube’s recommendation algorithm. It promotes, recommends and disseminates videos in a manner that appears to constantly up the stakes. Given its billion or so users, YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century. This is not because a cabal of YouTube engineers is plotting to drive the world off a cliff. A more likely explanation has to do with the nexus of artificial intelligence and Google’s business model. (YouTube is owned by Google.) For all its lofty rhetoric, Google is an advertising broker, selling our attention to companies that will pay for it. The longer people stay on YouTube, the more money Google makes. What keeps people glued to YouTube? Its algorithm seems to have concluded that people are drawn to content that is more extreme than what they started with — or to incendiary content in general. Is this suspicion correct? Good data is hard to come by; Google is loath to share information with independent researchers. But we now have the first inklings of confirmation, thanks in part to a former Google engineer named Guillaume Chaslot. Mr. Chaslot worked on the recommender algorithm while at YouTube. He grew alarmed at the tactics used to increase the time people spent on the site. Google fired him in 2013, citing his job performance. He maintains the real reason was that he pushed too hard for changes in how the company handles such issues. The Wall Street Journal conducted an investigation of YouTube content with the help of Mr. Chaslot. It found that YouTube often “fed far-right or far-left videos to users who watched relatively mainstream news sources,” and that such extremist tendencies were evident with a wide variety of material. If you searched for information on the flu vaccine, you were recommended anti-vaccination conspiracy videos. It is also possible that YouTube’s recommender algorithm has a bias toward inflammatory content. In the run-up to the 2016 election, Mr. Chaslot created a program to keep track of YouTube’s most recommended videos as well as its patterns of recommendations. He discovered that whether you started with a pro-Clinton or pro-Trump video on YouTube, you were many times more likely to end up with a pro-Trump video recommended. Combine this finding with other research showing that during the 2016 campaign, fake news, which tends toward the outrageous, included much more pro-Trump than pro-Clinton content, and YouTube’s tendency toward the incendiary seems evident. YouTube has recently come under fire for recommending videos promoting the conspiracy theory that the outspoken survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., are “crisis actors” masquerading as victims. Jonathan Albright, a researcher at Columbia, recently “seeded” a YouTube account with a search for “crisis actor” and found that following the “up next” recommendations led to a network of some 9,000 videos promoting that and related conspiracy theories, including the claim that the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn., was a hoax. What we are witnessing is the computational exploitation of a natural human desire: to look “behind the curtain,” to dig deeper into something that engages us. As we click and click, we are carried along by the exciting sensation of uncovering more secrets and deeper truths. YouTube leads viewers down a rabbit hole of extremism, while Google racks up the ad sales. Human beings have many natural tendencies that need to be vigilantly monitored in the context of modern life. For example, our craving for fat, salt and sugar, which served us well when food was scarce, can lead us astray in an environment in which fat, salt and sugar are all too plentiful and heavily marketed to us. So too our natural curiosity about the unknown can lead us astray on a website that leads us too much in the direction of lies, hoaxes and misinformation. In effect, YouTube has created a restaurant that serves us increasingly sugary, fatty foods, loading up our plates as soon as we are finished with the last meal. Over time, our tastes adjust, and we seek even more sugary, fatty foods, which the restaurant dutifully provides. When confronted about this by the health department and concerned citizens, the restaurant managers reply that they are merely serving us what we want. This situation is especially dangerous given how many people — especially young people — turn to YouTube for information. Google’s cheap and sturdy Chromebook laptops, which now make up more than 50 percent of the pre-college laptop education market in the United States, typically come loaded with ready access to YouTube. This state of affairs is unacceptable but not inevitable. There is no reason to let a company make so much money while potentially helping to radicalize billions of people, reaping the financial benefits while asking society to bear so many of the costs.

Washington,448," By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and SHERYL GAY STOLBERGMARCH 12, 2018 WASHINGTON — President Trump on Monday abandoned his promise to work for gun control measures opposed by the National Rifle Association, bowing to the gun group and embracing its agenda of armed teachers and incremental improvements to the background check system. After the Florida high school massacre last month, Mr. Trump explicitly called on live television for raising the age limit to purchase rifles and backed 2013 legislation for near-universal background checks. He later told lawmakers that while the N.R.A. has “great power over you people, they have less power over me.” But on Monday, it was the president who seemed to knuckle under, again dramatizing the sway that the N.R.A. still maintains in Republican circles. Students around the country might be massing for a march on Washington on March 24. The victims and survivors of school shootings from Connecticut to Florida may be pushing their states to move on gun control. But Mr. Trump cited a lack of political support for raising the age limit to purchase rifles, which is not evident in public opinion polls but is very much evident in his party.  He said that his administration was studying the issue and suggested that states should decide whether to prohibit people under 21 from buying the kind of assault weapon used by the gunman who rampaged through Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Polls show solid support for stricter laws, especially after mass shootings. But there is also deep disagreement, staunch opposition and growing disenchantment with gun control. Without referencing an Oval Office meeting he had with N.R.A. officials this month, the president acknowledged the group’s lobbying successes.  “Not much political support (to put it mildly),” Mr. Trump said of the higher age limit in a tweet, adding that his administration will watch court rulings before it acts. (He did not mention that it is the N.R.A. that is precipitating such court rulings by suing the State of Florida over its new gun purchasing age.) “To no one’s surprise, the president’s words of support for stronger gun safety laws proved to be hollow,” Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said. “Responding to the murder of 17 students and educators by endorsing the gun lobby’s platform is a shameful abdication of the president’s responsibility to lead. Shame on you, Mr. President.” The president’s retreat is a stark reminder — if anyone in Washington needed one — that the gun debate remains stuck where it has been for more than a decade. Despite scores of deaths from mass shootings in that time, Republican lawmakers fear the N.R.A.’s ability to stir up opposition in their districts. They continue to oppose new gun restrictions, and even a Republican president with an unconventional approach is unlikely to challenge the status quo in an election year. Only one gun-related measure, on background checks, seems likely to pass this year, but critics noted that it would only enforce existing law. “It really to me is simple,” Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber’s No. 2 Republican, said. “Do people want their whole laundry list of things done and end up empty-handed? That’s what usually happens. If you say, ‘I want 100 percent of what I want or nothing,’ we invariably end up with nothing.” In the face of N.R.A. opposition, the president has also retreated from his earlier openness to expanded background checks and a renewal of the expired ban on assault weapons — positions that he signaled during a remarkable meeting with lawmakers in which he demanded “comprehensive” legislation that would include longstanding Democratic efforts to restrict firearms.  Instead, Mr. Trump over the weekend released a modest plan that eschewed gun control measures in favor of more limited bills that would provide weapons training for teachers and create a commission to study other responses to school shootings. Attorney General Jeff Sessions did announce on Monday evening that the Justice Department would more aggressively enforce the existing law making it illegal to lie on federal background checks and would step up law enforcement presence at schools. Earlier Monday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said that the president still supported the idea of raising the minimum age for purchasing rifles, but was committing to studying the issue only because “you can’t just decide you want laws to pass.” “I think it is a really disappointing retreat after all the reality-show rhetoric,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview. Mr. Blumenthal, who represents the state where 20 children were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School, said the president “has taken his plan from the N.R.A. playbook.” Ms. Feinstein, who has long pushed for a ban on assault weapons, had looked giddy at the president’s meeting with lawmakers when Mr. Trump seemed open to new legislation to restrict the sale of the weapons. On Monday, she accused the president of having “completely caved to the gun lobby.” What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     The idea of arming teachers is vigorously opposed by many members of both parties, law enforcement officials and groups representing the nation’s teachers. But it has been pushed for years by the N.R.A., which argues that arming school officials is the best way to protect students and teachers against a well-armed attacker. “The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun,” the N.R.A. mantra has gone. On Capitol Hill, several Republican senators sounded cool to the idea of federal involvement in arming teachers, saying it should be left to the states. “There would have to be tremendous training, tremendous effort to make that work,” said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. The White House on Sunday proposed creating the Federal Commission on School Safety, which would study the question of raising the minimum age for purchasing rifles. That proposal came just a day after Mr. Trump himself mocked the idea of federal commissions as ineffective.  “We can’t just keep setting up blue-ribbon committees,” Mr. Trump said during a political rally on Saturday. The president said that members of such commissions do little more than “talk, talk, talk” and then, “two hours later, then they write a report.” On Capitol Hill, the energy has largely dissipated for the kind of expansive gun control legislation that Mr. Trump appeared to support earlier this month. With such legislation stalled, Republican leaders are instead turning their attention toward less contentious measures that would beef up security at the nation’s schools. The only gun-related measure that appears to stand a chance of passage this year is the so-called Fix NICS Act, a narrow N.R.A.-backed bill that would improve data reporting to the national background check database. The House has already passed it, as part of a broader bill that includes one of the N.R.A.’s highest priorities: a sharp expansion of the right to carry concealed weapons almost anywhere in the country. The Senate’s chief sponsor of Fix NICS, Mr. Cornyn, said in an interview last week that he had not spoken to the N.R.A. about it. He sees the bill as a way to bridge the partisan divide. But even Fix NICS is stuck. The bill has 61 co-sponsors in addition to Mr. Cornyn — two more than the 60 votes required to break a Senate filibuster. But at least two Republicans, and possibly a third, are blocking the Republican leadership from bringing the bill to the floor quickly for a vote. And Democrats have indicated that they are not eager to consider Fix NICS as a stand-alone measure. Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, has warned that it would be an “abject failure and dereliction of duty” if all Congress did was to pass Fix NICS. School safety measures, meanwhile, are moving forward. The Republican-controlled House is expected to vote Wednesday on the STOP School Violence Act, which would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence. In the Senate, a companion bill, championed by Mr. Hatch, would also give schools money for physical improvements, such as metal detectors or bulletproof windows and doors. And even if Senate leaders were inclined to bring up gun legislation for a vote, they are short on time. This week, the Senate is considering a measure to ease banking regulations, and next week senators will be working against a deadline to pass a catchall spending measure to fund the government; the current spending bill expires on March 23. After that, the Senate will be in recess for two weeks. Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.

Washington,449," By KATIE ROGERSMARCH 8, 2018 In the wake of the Parkland school shooting, President Trump has pointed to a common explanation for the violence: video games. But two decades after the Columbine shooting popularized this explanation for violent crime, research has rejected the hypothesis. WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday began the next leg of a listening tour he promised after last month’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., eliciting heated opinions at the White House from critics of violent video games and from game makers who reject any connection to mass shootings, but offering no concrete views of his own. In broaching the subject after a mass school shooting, Mr. Trump was traveling a path well worn by his predecessors going back for decades. But his approach was all his own. As he has done with recent round-table discussions on gun restrictions and immigration, Mr. Trump on Thursday seemed most interested in drawing impassioned opinions out of the people around him, according to people who attended. But he stopped short of offering solutions. Melissa Henson, the director of programs for the Parents Television Council, a censorship advocacy group, said the president tried to “draw people out” for a “lively” discussion.  “I don’t think he came to the meeting with his mind made up,” Ms. Henson said. “I think there’s more fact-finding to be done before anything is acted on.”  As with his thoughts on gun restrictions, it remains unclear exactly what Mr. Trump thinks can be done on this issue, or what he truly believes. But he has a parent’s insight on how young people encounter violent media. In a February round table he hosted with lawmakers on gun restrictions, the president said some content viewed by his 11-year-old son, Barron, had surprised him. “The video games, the movies, the internet stuff is so violent. It’s so incredible. I see it,” Mr. Trump said. “I look at some of the things he’s watching, and I say, ‘How is that possible?’ And this is what kids are watching. And I think you maybe have to take a look at it.” The administrations of President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama had tried to understand the issue with wide-ranging initiatives and recommendations after massacres at Columbine High School in 1999 and Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. Mr. Clinton ordered an investigation into advertising practices used to sell violent entertainment. And in 2013, Mr. Obama asked Congress to provide $10 million to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study the relationship between violence and video games. The funds were never allocated. People involved in listening tours during past administrations doubted that Mr. Trump’s meeting would lead to productive policy. Mark DeLoura, who worked as a digital media adviser in the Obama White House, said that a similar meeting after Sandy Hook had been “well rounded,” and that the recommendations that came out of that wide-ranging listening tour were concrete. “There are no researchers, no scientists,” Mr. DeLoura said of Mr. Trump’s meeting. “It doesn’t look like people reached out to the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the West Wing.” (The meeting was hastily arranged by the White House communications staff, according to one person with direct knowledge of how it came together.) On Thursday, White House officials kept the aims of the meeting vague, and declined to say why they had revoked journalists’ planned access to it.  “As we continue to work towards creating school safety programs that protect all children, the president will be meeting with video game industry leaders and members of Congress to discuss violent video-game exposure and the correlation to aggression and desensitization in children,” Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement. “This meeting will be the first of many with industry leaders to discuss this important issue.”      Conservatives have often turned to the idea of video game censorship after mass shootings to steer the discussion away from gun restrictions. In 2007, one month after an armed student killed 32 people at Virginia Tech, Mitt Romney, running for president, said that “pornography and violence” in music, movies, TV and video games were to blame. And after Sandy Hook, Wayne LaPierre, who leads the National Rifle Association, put the blame on the entertainment media. He called the video game industry a “corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows, violence against its own people” — naming games like Bulletstorm, Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat and Splatterhouse. The response by video game makers has been to return the volley, blaming guns rights activists for deflection. They also refer to a 2011 Supreme Court decision that ruled that even the most violent video games were protected under the First Amendment. Those on opposing sides of the issue tend to rely on different data sets to understand the problem. Some point to a 2015 study by the American Psychological Association on violent video games and aggression that determined that “no single risk factor consistently leads a person to act aggressively or violently.” Others, including Dave Grossman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and a censorship advocate who attended the White House meeting, have cited research to back up the view that video games are essentially, as he wrote in 2013, “murder simulators.” Bruce Reed, the former chief of staff for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a former domestic policy adviser to Mr. Clinton, said a productive outcome for Mr. Trump’s meeting could include a discussion on funding more research into the problem. “It’s a worthwhile public health question,” he said, “quite apart from mass shootings and gun violence. But I suspect today’s meeting will demonstrate once again that politicians like to point fingers at other possible causes to deflect the pressure to act on the most obvious one.” Representative Vicky Hartzler of Missouri was one of three lawmakers, all Republican, who attended the meeting. In a statement, Ms. Hartzler said she admired the president’s approach of “leaving no stone unturned” but called for a broader examination of other industries, including film. “I believe the solution to curtailing violence lies in an all-encompassing approach, focused on several different factors that may contribute to school shootings,” Ms. Hartzler said.  Other attendees included Brent Bozell, a longtime advocate for media censorship, and Strauss Zelnick, the chairman of Take-Two Interactive, the video game maker behind Grand Theft Auto. Robert A. Altman, the chairman of ZeniMax Media, also attended. The president’s younger brother, Robert, sits on the board of that company. Mr. Trump, who met privately with N.R.A. leaders after appearing to side with Democrats on sweeping gun restrictions in February, has become known for shifting his stances in the hours after his frequent round-table sessions. On Thursday, meeting attendees were unable to divine how he felt. “I think it would be fair to say that he feels strongly, clearly that the violence in the video games is excessive,” said Ms. Henson, the censorship advocate who attended the meeting. “But I don’t think he went into the meeting with the purpose of condemning an entire industry.” Ms. Henson added that she had not heard any solutions proposed on Thursday that she had not heard before. Maya Salam and Liam Stack contributed reporting from New York.

Sports,450," By CHRISTOPHER CLAREYMARCH 11, 2018 INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — The Novak Djokovic crisis continues. For how much longer? He was unable to get past his opening match in Indian Wells on Sunday even after another extended break from the game he once dominated and after what he termed “a small medical intervention” on his troublesome right elbow. On court, the troubles most definitely continue, and what was mystifying on Sunday was that he looked strong and precise in the early phases of his three-set loss to the Japanese qualifier Taro Daniel in the second round of the BNP Paribas Open. Djokovic even looked ready to take a quick early lead on Stadium One, where he has won five singles titles on the hard courts where his elastic athleticism is best expressed. But those days seem increasingly like a desert mirage. In command, he abruptly handed the controls to the grateful Daniel, failing to serve out the opening set at 5-3 and then going on to lose it in a tiebreaker.  Though Djokovic came back to win the second set and celebrated with a once-trademarked roar, he went out with his latest whimper, losing 7-6 (3), 4-6, 6-1.  The final shot of the match was an errant forehand that was also his 58th unforced error. “Very weird; I just completely lost rhythm,” said Djokovic, the No. 10 seed, who added, “for me it felt like the first match I ever played on the tour.” He was asked to clarify. “Yeah, everything, nerves were there,” he said. “I made so many unforced errors that it was just one of those days where you are not able to find the rhythm from the baseline especially from the backhand side. That has always been a rock solid shot for me throughout my career. Just some inexplicable, uncharacteristic errors, but that’s I guess all part of those particular circumstances that I’m in at the moment.” Less than two years ago, Djokovic was the first man since Rod Laver to hold all four Grand Slam singles title and possessed a massive lead atop the rankings. But his elbow problem and off-court issues that he has declined to discuss in detail succeeded in knocking him off his perch. There is also the question that many great tennis champions have faced: How to keep summoning the fire within? “The Djokovic I know is like the Djokovic I have seen on TV, and he never misses a ball; he puts the ball wherever he wants,” said Daniel, the 25-year-old son of an American father and Japanese mother who was born in New York. “Today, obviously he was missing a lot of balls, but even then you still have to beat him.” After retiring during his quarterfinal match at Wimbledon last July, Djokovic did not play again for the rest of 2017 in an attempt to heal his elbow without surgery. He returned for last month’s Australian Open with a revamped, abbreviated service motion designed to relieve pressure on the elbow and showed flashes of fine form before eventually losing in straight sets to Hyeon Chung in the fourth round. After that defeat, he decided to undergo a medical procedure on his elbow in Switzerland — one that the 30-year-old Djokovic has yet to explain in detail. But he did say on Sunday that he initially did not expect to be ready to play in Indian Wells but recovered more quickly than anticipated. Asked if he was concerned about reinjuring the elbow against Daniel, Djokovic said, “not really.”  “But obviously having played only a couple matches in nine months, you are still in a way battling inside of your mind whether you are fit or not,” Djokovic said. “And even though you don’t have pain, you are still thinking about it because it’s something I’ve been feeling and dragging for over two years.” Clearly, comebacks from extended layoffs are nowhere near as smooth as Roger Federer has made his look since he returned in 2017 after a six-month break to heal his postoperative knee. He continues to roll and on Sunday in the second-round match that followed Djokovic’s, he finished off his two-day 6-3, 7-6 (6) victory over Federico Delbonis, saving a set point in the second-set tiebreaker.      That was shortly after the reigning U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens eliminated Victoria Azarenka, 6-1, 7-5. Azarenka, a two-time champion here, was playing her first tournament since Wimbledon last year because of an ongoing child custody dispute that is not yet resolved. “For me the most important is to have a clear head, which obviously right now is not,” she said. “Once I figure all my stuff outside the court, I’ll be able to focus and be 100 percent when I’m on the court.” Amanda Anisimova has nothing but tunnel vision for the moment. In just a few days, the American teenager has gone from being a player to watch for the future to being a player to fear in the present. Still 16 and subject to playing restrictions, she had not won a match on the WTA Tour before arriving in Indian Wells. She has now won three straight, beating the No. 23 seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the second round and then transforming her first appearance on Stadium One into a coming-of-age moment by upsetting Petra Kvitova, the No. 9 seed and two-time Wimbledon champion, 6-2, 6-4, on Sunday in the third round. Watching from on high, as Anisimova, the reigning U.S. Open junior champion, kept her composure during and between points, you would never have known that she had not been on this kind of tennis stage before. “It feels crazy; I mean, I’m still in shock,” said Anisimova, a 5-foot-11 Floridian whose parents are Russian but who represents the United States, where she was born and raised. “She’s the best player I have ever played, and it was the biggest court I have ever played on. So it was definitely nerve-racking kind of, but I was enjoying it so much out there. And I was playing my best. It was a good day.”  A very good day and also the latest sign that a new generation of very talented youngsters are emerging from the United States and elsewhere. In January, Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine reached the third round of the Australian Open at age 15. Anisimova, who did not make the long journey to Australia this year, was watching and taking note. “Definitely, I think it’s motivating,” Anisimova said. “When Marta Kostyuk got to the third round, you say, ‘I can do that, too.’” A very aggressive baseliner with one of the best two-handed backhands, Anisimova also is not afraid to tackle societal issues. She said one of her friends attends Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 were killed in a Feb. 14 shooting. She said her friend was uninjured but traumatized. “It’s really close to me; it’s really sad what’s going on; I think that guns should be banned,” she said. “You should have stricter laws on that for sure, and I don’t think teachers should be having guns in school.”  ",2018-03-11,0.0013412592,Sunday

On gun safety and, more significantly to many of them, trade, the president has loudly broken with longstanding party orthodoxy and reminded Republican leaders on Capitol Hill that they can never be 100 percent certain of what they are going to get with the onetime New York Democrat. Despite such worries, Mr. Trump’s first-year actions on policy and personnel — particularly judicial nominees — provided substantial reassurance to congressional Republicans. They concluded that Mr. Trump was really one of them when it came to bedrock issues and that the anti-Washington, drain-the-swamp cries from the raucous campaign rallies were only so many applause lines. In the chaos of the early weeks of his administration, Mr. Trump provoked a sigh of relief from Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, that the president seemed to actually be conservative. “If you look at the steps that have been taken so far, looks good to me,” Mr. McConnell said.  Now here comes Mr. Trump with his sudden proposal to rebuild the country’s steel and aluminum industries through steep tariffs on imports from leading trading partners. Most congressional Republicans fundamentally disagree with that approach, which they consider a backdoor tax that could easily touch off a calamitous trade war, hurt their local businesses and overwhelm any gains from their hard-won, Republican-only tax bill.  Already facing a harsh political climate heading toward the November midterm elections, Republicans fear that moving ahead with the tariffs could send the party — not to mention the economy — spiraling in the wrong direction. Republicans are banking on a robust economy that they can attribute to their tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks to overcome the deep public disapproval of Mr. Trump exhibited in multiple elections last year. They don’t want to do anything that could threaten economic gains. “The economy is moving in the right direction; that is what we are working on,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the chamber’s No. 3 Republican, told reporters on Tuesday. “We are going to stay focused on a pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda.” Mr. McConnell had remained quiet about the tariffs since Mr. Trump unexpectedly announced them last week. But on Tuesday, he made it very clear that he, and almost all of his colleagues, have major problems with them. “There’s a high level of concern about interfering with what appears to be an economy that’s taking off in every respect,” Mr. McConnell said. “I think the best way to characterize where I am, and where our members are, is we are urging caution that this develop into something much more dramatic that could send the economy in the wrong direction.” This major policy divide goes to a disconnect between the president and congressional Republican leaders that has been papered over by fights with Democrats over the past year as well as the party unity behind the tax bill. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     Most of the Republican leaders on Capitol Hill remain firmly aligned with big business and want to retain the strong support of advocacy groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and organizations affiliated with David H. and Charles G. Koch. Those business factions, always important to Republicans in a campaign year, do not like new tariffs. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, has for years preached about the dangers and disadvantages of free trade and the harm it has done to once-leading American industries. Republicans now hoping to talk the president down from his tariff stance may find that his campaign promises about protectionism are ones he truly wants to keep.  It is a similar situation with gun safety. Mr. Trump has in the past backed the idea of an assault weapons ban. But congressional Republicans figured that his strong campaign embrace of the National Rifle Association would keep him securely in the anti-gun-control corner. Then, in last week’s extraordinary public White House meeting after the Parkland, Fla., school massacre, Mr. Trump embraced multiple aspects of the gun control agenda. He even uttered the words “take the guns first” — a phrase previously unthinkable for a top Republican politician given the party’s history on gun rights. Republicans were aghast. They also figured that, under pressure from his allies at the N.R.A., Mr. Trump would quickly return to the fold and let his enthusiasm for gun control wane. More important, congressional Republicans also knew that gun control legislation was really in their hands, not the administration’s, and that they could easily bottle up any proposal. But tariffs are a completely different matter, with the president given wide latitude to act on international trade policy. Republicans, who say they have little legislative recourse, are now engaged in a furious effort to pull the president back from making too sweeping a decision. They are also treading carefully to avoid antagonizing a mercurial figure whose mind they still hope to change as they have in previous cases where he drifted from the party line, such as on immigration. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, for instance, was careful to credit Mr. Trump on Tuesday for exposing that some countries do take advantage of the trade rules. “The president’s right to point out that there are abuses,” Mr. Ryan said. “There clearly is dumping and transshipping of steel and aluminum.” Referring to any trade restrictions, Mr. Ryan said that Republicans simply “want to make sure that it’s done in a prudent way that’s more surgical, so we can limit unintended consequences.” As for Mr. McConnell, he said that “we need to wait and see what the White House finally decides to do on this.”  Mr. McConnell would no doubt prefer that Mr. Trump revert to the conventional conservative principles the senator found so comforting last year. But this break could prove to be real, putting Mr. Trump and his Republican allies at cross-purposes at an inauspicious moment on the political calendar.

                MARCH 27, 2018 Our usual message to children is that they have a lot less authority than they might wish. Parents, teachers, adults: These are the people, we explain, who are in charge. But in March, as tens of thousands of children across the country flooded out of their classrooms to protest gun violence in schools, the moment was hailed by some as a tremendous display of power — perhaps especially in those places where school administrators flexed their own authority and tried to prohibit students from participating. “Supporters say the walkouts and demonstrations represent a realization of power and influence by young people,” The Washington Post reported. “So amazing to see young people take back their power and USE it!” Miley Cyrus tweeted. “By myself, I don’t think I have the power,” one student told MSNBC. “But together with all these people here, I think we can make a change.” The very reason for the demonstrations, of course, was that the students did not possess one very specific kind of power — the ability to make rules or laws that might somehow curtail the number of guns and shootings in their schools. This lack of control over their own safety has been a key aspect of their rhetoric ever since survivors of the February shooting in Parkland, Fla., captured the nation’s attention via Twitter. “We’re children,” David Hogg said in an appearance on CNN. “You guys are the adults.” At least one senator seemed to agree, locating the real power not with the students but with the audience they addressed: “Keep speaking truth to power and demanding change,” Kirsten Gillibrand urged. In theory, that power resides with the nation’s voters, but even this is too indirect; we already know that Americans overwhelmingly favor more stringent gun regulation than their elected officials are inclined to enact. It is a much smaller segment of people who hold the clearest authority to change things: the professional political class. And even as those children demonstrated, a healthy portion of that class was studiously ignoring them and earnestly debating the merits of arming teachers instead. If they were in any real way affected by the power of a student walkout, they certainly weren’t admitting it. The students’ power to captivate a share of the public sat in one corner; elected officials’ power to actually rule over that public sat quietly in another. No matter how thundering the children’s dissent might have been, there was no meaningful intersection between those two kinds of power. In 1990, the Harvard international relations scholar Joseph Nye published a book, “Bound to Lead,” in which he drew a distinction between two different forms of power. One was what he called “hard” or “command” power — the traditional guns-and-money leverage one nation could use to force another nation to do what it wanted. For the other, he coined the term “soft power” — meaning “when one country gets other countries to want what it wants.” Soft power was more seductive than coercive; it could be built on culture, on ideals, on leading by example.  Nye’s terms are now used by political scientists and business-school professors alike. They are a product of the same line of thinking that appears in a common expression: “Power comes in many forms.” This is the same line of thinking too that so often has undergraduate students intoxicated by the ideas of the French theorist Michel Foucault, who saw power as ephemeral, taking countless shapes, everywhere and nowhere: It was “at once visible and invisible, present and hidden, ubiquitous,” like a light emanating from a thousand pinprick sources. Foucault’s idea of resistance was to spend your time mapping out all those pinprick sources of power, like the stars: If you wanted to speak truth to power, he suggested, you first had to divine your position inside a whole constellation of influence. This sort of thinking can make our view of power far more nuanced and complex, but it can also make it quite confusing. The dispiriting message some took away from Foucault was that things were, ultimately, a bit hopeless: Power was far too chaotic to help anyone figure out the right thing to do.  This dizzying and disordered vision of power isn’t reserved for high-stakes international affairs or abstract philosophical contexts. It is a feature of almost every social or cultural battle we have. The question of power has buzzed its way, for instance, through a huge share of recent conversations about sexual harassment. In many #MeToo stories, the power a harasser has over his target is clear and hard as a diamond: He is the boss; he can hire or fire, promote or demote. But in so many others, a softer pull is involved — a matter of age, or ambient status, or standing within an industry. Last month, when several women told NPR about what they saw as exploitative relationships with the writer Sherman Alexie, one described her account as one “about power, and abuse of power.” This wasn’t because Alexie necessarily held any formal or official power over the other writers he encountered; the power his accuser was referring to derived from his literary success, influence and social standing. People hold countless opinions about accusations like this, and plenty of them have already been aired at great and contentious length. But even within those arguments, the question of who holds “power” is a constant, each side insisting it lies with the other. In a Slate interview with Isaac Chotiner, the writer Katie Roiphe, who has expressed skepticism about what she sees as the rush to judgment of #MeToo, described being pilloried in response. When Chotiner tried to suggest that being vilified by Twitter users might not be so consequential, the two reached an impasse. “You are saying they don’t have power, but I think they do have power,” Roiphe said. She saw a group of social media critics and writers as having the power to set the terms of the conversation; they undoubtedly felt the same way about her, a tenured professor scolding them from the pages of a prestigious publication like Harper’s. It was this point, Chotiner said, that was “the crux of our disagreement.” Which is in its own way a summation of where we all are: Everyone, from the online critic to the president, seems always to believe that power lies elsewhere, in some branch of the constellation beyond their reach. Try to map out almost any part of this cultural moment, and you will find something similarly chaotic — all the players passing by one another, each convinced they are doing the right thing, and very few convinced that they, in the face of powerful opposition, have enough influence to affect much at all. Those who feel inspired by cultural moments like the student walkout tend to be struck by how easy it can feel, once a certain critical mass builds, to sweep away what once seemed like entrenched and unassailable sources of might. “Power is like money: imaginary, entirely dependent on belief,” Tim Kreider wrote in a Times Op-Ed in March, urging the young to rise up against the usual order of things. “Most of the power of institutions lies in the faith people have in them.” But the slippage between those two sentences — between “entirely” and “most of” — is not always easy to overcome. Some power is very concrete; some power really is a gun to your head. And the fact that some of it is very soft — that it is socially constructed, or dependent on belief — does not make it any less real. It is indeed just like money, just not in the way Kreider thinks: You may conclude that dollar bills are mere worthless symbols of value, but your lack of faith will not prevent your starving to death without them. The chaos and multiplicity of power, then, can be something of a magic trick, keeping us arguing forever about who has it. Which isn’t to say there isn’t room for clarity about certain definite, reliable sources of power. The science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick, for instance, found it difficult to believe in any single, stable reality — but in a 1978 essay, he explained how even an anarchic world could have its masters. He believed in creating new realities, he said; he’d dedicated his life to it. But he didn’t think all realities were created equal. “Unceasingly we are bombarded with pseudorealities manufactured by very sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic mechanisms,” he said. “I do not distrust their motives; I distrust their power. They have a lot of it.” He was talking, back then, about television and the Disney corporation. Today, though, it’s easy to hear those words and think of Facebook, or Twitter, or any of the “electronic mechanisms” on which our broad movements of anger or disinformation emerge. Right now the owners of these platforms seem to believe they are merely facilitating maps of every point of power in the universe. They thrive on all our little contests and arguments about who has power over whom and eschew responsibility for any of the chaos created by them. But as we’ve learned in recent weeks, there is actual power accruing to the hosts of all our debates, and to the maps they make of us — maps others may use in trying to manipulate, say, the outcome of an election. This power is concrete, and its source obvious. It is worth, as Dick says, our distrust.

Washington,453," By EMILY COCHRANE and MAGGIE HABERMANMARCH 10, 2018 MOON TOWNSHIP, Pa. — The trip was ostensibly an effort to help Republicans stave off a deflating defeat in a western Pennsylvania congressional district that President Trump won by 20 points. And in a rally at Pittsburgh’s airport on Saturday evening, Mr. Trump did mention the Republican running in Tuesday’s special election, Rick Saccone, a handful of times. A good man, he called him. But for almost all of his 75-minute performance in front of a raucous crowd packed into a hangar, it was in-his-element Trump, vintage 2016: rambling and fiery, boastful and jocular — the part of being president that he loves perhaps the most. Ricocheting off the teleprompter, the president showed the kind of free-flowing attitude that his aides have said they expect to see this year. He ticked off what he said were his achievements — some coming just in recent days — on a laundry list of issues like North Korea, trade and the economy, and attacked his predecessors for their failures on the same.  He spoke admiringly of foreign laws imposing the death penalty on drug dealers, and seemed to brush aside the notion of due process as he spoke of American officers grabbing gang members “by the neck” and throwing them in the paddy wagon.  He derided past presidents as stiffs and lousy entertainers. He pummeled his favorite targets: Democrats and the “fake” news media. And, always the showman, he dropped a bit of news, revealing the slogan for his 2020 re-election campaign: Keep America Great. With an exclamation mark, he said. “Is there anything more fun than a Trump rally?” he asked on the heels of a whirlwind week in which his chief economics adviser said he was resigning, he formalized steep tariffs on steel and aluminum that angered business leaders and allies, and he abruptly announced, through South Korean officials, that he  intended to meet with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. But while the rally seemed to reveal a president happier than he has been in weeks, his mentioning of the new slogan, which he had alluded to for months but never before highlighted, pointed to the challenge he will face in 2020. While he will argue that he has done much to restore the country to greatness, he will have to make a case that there is enough left undone that he should be given another term to finish the job. He said he would welcome a battle against another television celebrity who has been a fantasy candidate for Democrats: Oprah Winfrey. But if she runs, he warned a bit ominously, “I know her weakness.” “Wouldn’t we love to run against Oprah?” he asked. “I would love it. I would love it. That would be a painful experience for her.” The rally, which had been rescheduled after the deadly Parkland, Fla., shooting last month, capped a frenzied stretch of fund-raising and campaigning on behalf of Mr. Saccone, who is locked in a tight race with the Democratic nominee, Conor Lamb. “He’s an extraordinary person,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Saccone, dismissing Mr. Lamb as “Lamb the Sham.” “The people of Pittsburgh cannot be conned by this guy Lamb, because he’s not going to vote for us.”      It was an opening for Mr. Trump not only to try to apply his political sway in the year’s first special election — one being looked at as a bellwether for the November midterm elections — but also to seize the opportunity to promote his new tariffs before a steel-country base of supporters far more receptive than the officials and pundits in Washington. “Steel is back,” he proclaimed more than once. “Aluminum is back.” He also, after receiving some boos upon first mentioning Mr. Kim, the North Korean dictator, said that he thought the North Koreans “want peace.” He said that his unprecedented meeting could go two very different ways: “We may leave fast,” or strike one of history’s greatest deals.  While the rally was not specifically advertised as one for Mr. Saccone, a loss by him would mark the third time that Mr. Trump had thrown his political might behind a candidate without success. With his low poll numbers, Republican leaders and the White House are trying to determine how to handle his desire to campaign in the midterms. But he was a hit with the crowd on Saturday. He retreated to fan favorites: reminiscing about his Electoral College victory, and saying that there is a “lot of evil in Washington” and that he is “getting it out.” To cheers and laughter, Mr. Trump hurled some old and new slurs and insults toward his opponents as he complained about his media coverage and perceived Democratic obstruction. He embellished his derisive “Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd” nickname for the “Meet the Press” host by calling him a “sleeping son of a bitch.” He said “Pocahontas” — his name for Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts — would produce bad television ratings if she challenged him in 2020. And he dismissed Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, as a “low-I.Q. individual,” delivering, in a predominantly white region, an insult that to many carries racial undertones. Mr. Trump boasted of his appeal to female voters, falsely claiming that he had received 52 percent of women’s votes in 2016. (He received 52 percent of votes from white women.) “Hey, didn’t we surprise them with women during the election?” he said, noting that his opponent was a woman. “Remember? ‘Women won’t like Donald Trump.’ I said, ‘Have I really had that kind of a problem?’” During the campaign, a number of women leveled allegations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Trump. And as president, he continues to be shadowed by accusations of an affair by the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels. Still, he tossed compliments toward his wife, Melania Trump. “You think her life is so easy, folks? Not so easy,” he said. And the president himself? Surrounded by his supporters, his foils in the news media, and a campaign soundtrack, he was at ease. Emily Cochrane reported from Moon Township, Pa., and Maggie Haberman from New York.

Insider,454," Interview by LARA TAKENAGAMARCH 6, 2018 The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work. Among some younger readers, The Times may still have a reputation for being the older generation’s newspaper, that stodgy Gray Lady who at times tries to be hip, but hews to 166 years of tradition. 
            Check out my ""peeps"" at http://twitter.com/friends/index/807095 (more feeds added daily). Thank you and ""peace out"" or whatever you kids say         We, of course, disagree. And lately, we’ve been experimenting with shaking things up a bit, trying to find better ways to listen to more people. As part of that effort, we’re relaunching The Edit, a Times newsletter for college students and those starting their careers.  In January, we announced that we were seeking to bring on five regular contributors to The Edit. The response was overwhelming: 20,000 people applied.  Now, Lindsey Underwood, the editor of The Edit, and other journalists at The Times are busy reading through the mountain of applications, and making plans for the newsletter’s relaunch. As a millennial member of the Reader Center, I sat down with Lindsey to talk about the viral response to our call for contributors and The Times’s efforts to reach new audiences. (The application was open to anyone of any age, but we were especially interested in hearing from college students and recent graduates.) How did The Edit start, and how do you plan to use it as a platform? The Edit launched a few years ago and began as a curated list of Times stories that we thought would interest college students. A lot of those readers sent us feedback saying they wanted to see more of their voices represented in The Times. Based on that, we decided that we should relaunch The Edit and find a way to incorporate their perspectives. Once we choose our contributors from the applications we received, we will feature their stories and voices in the newsletter. The relaunch of The Edit is part of a larger effort by The Times to engage with college students and recent graduates. Why is The Times focusing more on these readers, and how are we changing to appeal to them? I don’t think it was surprising for any of us to hear that readers say they sometimes don’t see themselves represented in The Times. If we’re leaving out such a large part of the population in our report, that must mean our coverage is missing something.  How did you react when you saw thousands of applications coming in? Maybe we were being naïve, but we initially thought we might get a couple of hundred applications. But soon after the post went up, it went viral and the responses started pouring in. We were blown away by the excitement and quickly realized we were in for something much bigger. (I also had to adjust my email settings.) Most people found the application on social media, where they shared it with their friends. We ended up extending the deadline because there were so many people who wanted to apply. What was the application process?  We asked applicants to write a few sentences about themselves and then choose one of four prompts to answer. What are some of the themes you’re seeing in the responses? Going through the applications has been really fun. I’m glad the questions we asked allowed people to go in a lot of directions with their responses. One prompt was “What’s your biggest pet peeve about the way that people write about your generation?” There are only so many stereotypes that we all know about millennials and Gen Z, so a lot of the answers draw upon the same themes. But with that question, you can see how strong of a writer an applicant is and how compelling of an argument he or she can make. For another prompt, we asked applicants to write about something they’re obsessed with. This question led to the widest range of responses. Some people wrote fun odes to mozzarella sticks and cold showers. Others took on weightier issues like climate change and housing reform. There’s no right answer to a question like this, so it’s great to see how people chose to respond. Where did candidates send applications from?  We’ve heard from people all over the world, from West Virginia to West Africa. I’ve really been surprised by the number and diversity of international applicants. It’s also great to see that people wrote to us from across the United States. I’m glad we were able to get such a wide range of applicants, and hope our contributors will reflect that diversity in their work for The Edit. What qualities does the ideal candidate have? Is a background in journalism important? The most important thing is that the applicants have ideas. When college students and recent graduates say they don’t see themselves in The Times, then the next question is, What do you want to see? If they can come up with ideas for improving our coverage and topics that will interest their peers, that’s the real sweet spot. The applications that excite me most have ideas that I never would have come up with, or that touch on something I didn’t even know existed. A strong foundation in writing is a plus, of course, but we’re not necessarily looking for journalists. This isn’t a traditional media position.  Who's reading the applications, and what’s the process for reviewing them? We have a team of editors and others from around The Times, mostly from our newsroom. We’re dividing up all the applications and closely reading each and every one. We’re doing the first round right now and will be in touch with people who are moving on to the second stage. We aren’t sure how many rounds there will be yet. How many people will you choose? When will they be announced? We initially planned to select five contributors. Because of the huge response we got, we are probably going to increase that number. I’ve gotten a ton of emails and messages on social media from people wondering when they’ll find out about their applications. Since we’re still reviewing them and planning the relaunch of The Edit, all I can promise is that we’ll be in touch as soon as we have news. That should be in the coming months, if not the coming weeks. What are some of the subjects that the contributors will write about? What form will their stories take? We have an awesome opportunity to feature a mix of stories. In the weeks since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., you can’t help but notice the many high schoolers who are speaking up about gun violence, and see a need for more opportunities for students to share their views on real issues. I think there’s also room to approach topics that you wouldn’t find elsewhere in The Times. Maybe that’s a meme or a YouTuber who wouldn’t normally have a place in the report. This is a great chance to shed light on some of those things, too. We’re also really open to different story formats, like reported articles and personal essays. It will just depend on what the story is and how we think it’s best told. I would love to incorporate video and other media. How frequently will the contributors write? That’s a bit up in the air right now. There was so much excitement about the application that we’re thinking about increasing the frequency of the newsletter, which comes out every other week right now. However that shakes out, we’ll work with the writers to figure out a cadence that makes sense for them.  How long will these first contributing positions last? We said that we were looking for people to work with us this year. This is a new program, so depending on where we are and where they are toward the end of that period, the positions could last longer. Will there be another application for the next group of contributors? I hope the relaunch is a huge success and that we’ll be able to do another callout relatively soon. There’s clearly a lot of interest from college students and recent graduates to work with The Times. Will there be other opportunities for applicants who aren’t chosen as contributors? Definitely! We’re thinking a lot about how we can offer other ways to get involved. We’ll be in touch with applicants in the coming months about some of those opportunities.

Metro,455," By SHARON OTTERMANMARCH 6, 2018 A federal lawsuit filed in New York by a victim of a Bronx hospital shooting calls for ending sales of AR-15 rifles to civilians, adding a new front in the national debate surrounding the weapon of choice in mass shootings, including at a Florida high school last month. The lawsuit was filed by Dr. Justin Timperio, 29, a medical resident who was seriously injured in June 2017 by a gunman with an AR-15 who killed one doctor and injured five other people at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center. It aims in part to be a test case weighing the founding fathers’ intent in crafting the Second Amendment against George Washington’s idea that individuals need to give up a share of their liberty to preserve the rest. The AR-15 rifle has been used in many shootings across the country, including at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.; a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. “It is time to recognize that the gun advocate’s slogan of ‘Guns Don’t Kill People, People Kill People,’ does not justify the mass deaths and injuries from AR-15s, modified or not, and finally conclude that an AR-15 firearm serves no rational purpose to exist in our society today,” the lawsuit states.  The suit seeks monetary damages from the hospital for failing to provide a safe environment for its employees and patients. It also alleges negligence by Upstate Guns and Ammo, the firearms dealer in Schenectady, N.Y., that sold the modified AR-15 rifle used in the shooting.  Dr. Henry Bello, who had resigned from the hospital in 2015 amid a sexual harassment charge and blamed doctors there for destroying his career, legally bought the gun about a week before his rampage. He killed himself in the aftermath of the June 30 attack. At a news conference on Tuesday, Dr. Timperio recounted how he was shot through the liver while filing medical notes on the hospital’s 16th floor. He and a female resident, who had been shot in the neck, narrowly escaped past Dr. Bello as he was setting the nearby nursing station on fire. Dr. Bello had turned to them, a wall of flames towering behind him. “He was shouting after us, come back here, cursing at us,” Dr. Timperio said. “I was certain I was going to die.” By the time Dr. Timperio and his colleague made it to the 11th floor, where security guards helped them, Dr. Bello had fatally shot himself on the 16th floor. New York State has an assault-weapon ban that prevents unmodified versions of the AR-15 from being sold. But gun dealers and manufacturers can modify the weapon to get around the ban. Upstate Guns and Ammo had legally sold the modified weapon to Dr. Bello, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said last July. New York City’s assault-rifle ban is stricter than elsewhere in the state. As a result, Dr. Timperio’s lawsuit charges that the gun dealer should have called the New York Police Department to check whether Dr. Bello, as a New York City resident, held a special permit that would be required of owners of rifles in the city.      There does not appear to be a specific legal statute requiring such a call be placed. However, Arnold Kriss, Dr. Timperio’s lawyer, said he believes the gun store had an obligation to do so under general gun laws that require weapons be sold safely, according to local ordinances. Mr. Kriss said that to his knowledge this issue has not been litigated, and he is hoping to set precedent with the case.  “It will be up to a judge and hopefully, a jury, to make the final determination about whether the firearms dealer had a duty to make that phone call,” he said. Michael Murphy, a lawyer in Albany representing Upstate Guns and Ammo, said he had no comment. The lawsuit also questions whether the appropriate background check was done before hiring Dr. Bello, and it alleges the hospital was negligent in permitting Dr. Bello to retain his hospital badge after he resigned in 2015, despite concerns about his aggressive behavior with the staff. On the day of the shooting, Dr. Bello was wearing his badge prominently on his white lab coat, Dr. Timperio recalled. Dr. Bello entered the hospital at around 2:45 p.m., wearing a hooded sweatshirt under his lab coat despite the summer heat. He was carrying a box large enough to hide a rifle in, as well as a juice container filled with gasoline, the police said. A spokesman for Bronx-Lebanon Hospital declined to comment, citing the litigation. After being shot, Dr. Timperio spent 10 days intubated and in a coma. Bullets shot from an AR-15 can result in particularly brutal injuries, and in his case, after the bullet passed through his liver, it ricocheted through his stomach and intestines before exiting through his right thigh. Dr. Timperio, a Canadian citizen who will return to a medical residency later this year, said he still has general nerve pain, as well as pain near the scars left by five surgeries. He said he doesn’t know if his condition will worsen to where he will not be able to work; it is for that reason he said he is suing for cash damages. He also is hoping to use the lawsuit to push hospitals to improve security. But he hesitated before saying he was angry at Bronx-Lebanon, calling that a strong word. ”I wish that people that go to a hospital for medical care don’t get shot, and that doctors don’t get shot,” he said. “Whether you want to call that anger or hope is up to you.” A version of this article appears in print on March 7, 2018, on Page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: Doctor Shot at Hospital Sues to Limit AR-15s, Hoping for a Precedent.

National,456," By DANA GOLDSTEINMARCH 6, 2018 Raucous cheers echoed off the high marble ceilings of the West Virginia Capitol on Tuesday as state leaders announced they had met striking teachers’ demands for a 5 percent pay raise. “Who made history?” chanted the throng of red-clad teachers, who had defied state officials and, at times, even their own union leaders, by staging a nearly two-week walkout. “We made history!” The strike indeed takes a place in history, and not just for the result. Since the earliest days of teacher organizing more than a century ago, almost every moment of teacher activism has come during times of social upheaval. In 1897, the modern teachers’ union movement was born in Chicago, where teachers presided over classrooms of up to 60 children, many of whom could not speak English, in a city surging with immigrants and struggling to control rampant child labor and typhoid in the water. All for the equivalent of $13,000 a year in today’s dollars. Later strikes came during struggles over racial inequality and the future of public school teaching itself. And as classrooms light up again across West Virginia this week, teachers will be resuming their daily struggles against two modern ills: an intractable drug crisis on top of a growing nationwide fear of bloodshed in the classroom.  “The work is all-encompassing,” said Karla Hilliard, a high school English teacher in Martinsburg, W.Va., and one of roughly 20,000 teachers who participated in the statewide strike.  “In West Virginia we deal with high levels of poverty and the opioid epidemic,” she said, “but then there are the smaller things, like kids who come in and they don’t have support at home and they just need someone to care about them and love them.” The strike began in protest of a plan to give teachers a 2 percent raise this July and 1 percent in each of the next two years, after years of stagnating pay and rising health insurance costs. Last week, after Gov. James C. Justice, a Republican, announced a plan to increase pay by 5 percent, union leaders said classes would resume. But teachers refused, demanding that the Legislature vote to make the raise official. That finally happened on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear where the money would come from, but the governor promised there would not be cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance for the poor. 
            We have reached a deal. I stood rock solid on the 5% Teacher pay raise and delivered. Not only this, but my staff and I made additional cuts which will give all State employees 5% as well. All the focus should have always been on fairness and getting the kids back in school.         Teachers in the state last year earned an average of about $46,000, $13,000 less than the national average. In only three states did teachers earn less: Mississippi, South Dakota and Oklahoma. In the last week, 40,000 people have joined a Facebook group calling for a walkout of Oklahoma teachers. But some West Virginia lawmakers expressed concern about the cost of the raises. While its cost of living is in the middle of the pack, the state is poor: Its median household income of $43,385, according to Census Bureau estimates from 2016, placed it 49th in the nation, ahead of only Mississippi. West Virginia has the nation’s fourth-highest unemployment rate and an opioid overdose death rate that is more than three times the national average. All of this plays out in the classroom. “I can’t tell you how many students we have being raised by grandparents because of parents’ drug addictions,” said Jay O’Neal, a seventh-grade English teacher and a leader of the strike. “It’s just part of a broader problem teaching here, dealing with the effects of poverty.” At Mr. O’Neal’s school, Stonewall Jackson Middle School in Charleston, teachers use their own money to stock a closet for students whose clothes are dirty or do not fit, or who come in wearing shorts when it is freezing outside. At faculty meetings each year, they draw some children’s names off an “angel tree” and provide them with Christmas gifts, because otherwise they would not get any.  Recently, Mr. O’Neal said, teachers have noticed that some students with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or A.D.H.D., have been coming to school unmedicated and disrupting an entire class; the teachers suspect parents are selling their children’s medications. Since the mid-19th century, it has generally been the women who have been expected to do this kind of difficult, nurturing work. That gender divide played a big role in early teacher activism.      Today, about 75 percent of teachers in West Virginia and across the United States are female. When teachers first unionized in Chicago at the turn of the 20th century, 97 percent were women, and they were paid little more than maids. Policymakers did not see that as a problem. Instead, they wanted to devote their extra funds to recruiting male teachers, who they thought would be tougher, and thus better able to control those huge, 60-student classes. The female teachers got angry, launched their federation, and within several years had secured a raise. They shocked the nation’s elite by marching, in petticoats, alongside Teamsters and other male unionists. Margaret Haley, a founder of the Chicago Teachers Federation, was inspired by Susan B. Anthony and other suffragists, just as today, some West Virginia teachers have come to activism through the 2017 Women’s March, the #MeToo movement or Black Lives Matter. The politics of teacher strikes shift over time, but in every generation, their leaders have forged ties to broader social movements. Many of the union leaders who led the nation’s most famous — or infamous — teacher strike, in New York City in 1968, were first active in the civil rights movement, including the 1963 March on Washington and Freedom Summer in 1964. Nevertheless, when black and Latino activists pushed for community and parent control of struggling schools, including the right to remove teachers, the union went on strike to protect teachers’ tenure rights. The seven-day teacher strike in Chicago in 2012 came a year after Occupy Wall Street, and rode a wave of dissatisfaction with elite influence in public education. Teachers won a raise and successfully pushed back against Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s desire to evaluate teachers based on their students’ test scores. Today in West Virginia, policymakers have their own ideas about how to improve schools. The State Department of Education has revamped vocational education, while the Republican-controlled Legislature has debated weakening teachers’ seniority protections and providing parents with tax incentives to pay for private school tuition.  But the striking teachers asked that the State Legislature first consider the basics: the salaries and benefits that they say would keep them from fleeing the state. Terry Moe, a Stanford political scientist and often a critic of teachers’ unions, said on Monday that West Virginia teachers were not asking for anything radical. “A 5 percent raise is not much,” he said. “There’s a good case to be made that West Virginia ought to put more priority on education, and they’re not.” President Trump has suggested one way teachers could earn more — by agreeing to become armed, in order to protect students from school shootings, like the one that killed 17 people in Parkland, Fla., last month. Ms. Hilliard’s school, Spring Mills High School, has had drills and lockdowns to prepare faculty and students for threats such as a potential school gunman. Recently the school ran a “code red” drill that she thought was real, because teachers were not warned in advance. “It was nothing short of terrifying,” she said. “Our job descriptions are expanding,” said Ms. Hilliard, who opposes the idea of arming teachers, which West Virginia currently does not allow. “It becomes ‘Lay down your life if you have to.’” Jess Bidgood contributed reporting.

Business,457," By TIFFANY HSUMARCH 8, 2018 President Trump met Thursday with several Republican lawmakers, video game industry representatives and others — no scientists, though — to discuss the role video games play in sparking real-world violence. The summit — called by Mr. Trump after reports that the gunman who killed 17 people in Parkland, Fla., last month had played violent games — was far from the first where concerned politicians raised the alarm over pixelated violence. It is a subject that has provided government officials from both sides of the aisle a convenient target for criticism since the 1970s. The calls to arms reached a climax in late 1993, as outrage flared over nonstop beheadings and spurting blood in the popular Mortal Kombat game. Senator Joe Lieberman, then a Democrat of Connecticut, helped lead hearings on Capitol Hill that put video game executives under the spotlight. The hearings eventually led to a video game ratings system that continues to this day. Years later, the vast majority of researchers say questions over a possible link between video game violence and violence such as mass shootings have long been answered: There isn’t a connection between them.  “If we’re talking about violence, then the evidence is very clear that there is no causal link to violent video games,” said Christopher J. Ferguson, a psychology professor at Stetson University in Florida. “That’s pretty established at this point.”  Here is a look at the events that led to the hearings, and their aftermath. Violent video games began drawing the attention of the authorities shortly after they started showing up in arcades. In the 1970s, a game called Death Race, which required players to simulate hit-and-run killings from behind the wheel, was described by the National Safety Council as “sick, sick, sick.” In the 1980s, Dr. C. Everett Koop, the United States surgeon general, voiced concerns  that video games might be detrimental to young people, who he said could become addicted to them “body and soul.” But by the early 1990s, concern had morphed into panic. Rhetoric about an epidemic of violence ran rampant, fueled by fears of teenage gangs and murderers. On Dec. 7, 1993, a gunman killed six people on a crowded Long Island Rail Road train during rush hour. Not long before, the intensely popular and extremely bloody arcade game Mortal Kombat had become available for home gaming systems. Players squared off against opponents in one-on-one fights; the victor could employ a character-specific “fatality” that allowed the winning avatar to tear out the loser’s heart or execute some other coup de grâce. Mortal Kombat’s first iteration featured weapons, but no firearms. The brutal game became a favorite target for critics of violence marketed to children, along with a more obscure game called Night Trap, whose premise involved a surveillance agent protecting teenage girls from blood-craving monsters. Mr. Lieberman led the charge in denouncing such games as desensitizing young players. The same month as the Long Island train massacre, he spearheaded a series of congressional hearings into the influence of video games on real-world violence. “We’re talking about video games that glorify violence and teach children to enjoy inflicting the most gruesome forms of cruelty imaginable,” he said at a news conference that December.  Amid the growing concern, MTV ran a special called “Generation Under the Gun,” in which teenagers discussed their relationships with firearms. Toys “R” Us vowed to stop selling Night Trap. The gaming industry formed its first trade group, which is now known as the Entertainment Software Association.      To head off lawmakers’ threats to form a federal commission to oversee video games, the organization quickly created a regulatory body known as the Entertainment Software Ratings Board. The board’s rating system, largely modeled after the one used by the movie industry, assigned letter grades to video games based on  their content, with the most violent games reserved for players 17 or older. The industry promised the new system would be in place in time for the 1994 holiday buying season. But politicians and lobbyists from both sides of the aisle would continue to point to video games as a possible culprit in mass shootings. The two teenage gunmen who killed 12 fellow students and a teacher at Columbine High School in 1999 were said to have played the first-person shooter game Doom, which led Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, to accuse Hollywood and computerized games as having “undermined the core values of civility.” A few months after the shooting, President Bill Clinton asked the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how violent media, including video games, was being marketed to children. Regulatory efforts were stymied in 2011, when the Supreme Court blocked a California law that sought to ban the sale of violent video games to young people. But in the aftermath of the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School the next year, President Barack Obama asked Congress for funds to research the effects of violence in video games. Nearly 25 years have passed since the 1993 hearings, and video games are vastly more realistic and social, with gamers capable of participating in 100-person “Battle Royale”-style death matches. The ratings system is generally considered to have been effective in keeping children from directly acquiring violent games, although many still find ways to get hold of them. And the prospect of legislative action seems to have faded. “Now, there are very few legislators under 60 who don’t have kids who play video games or who don’t play themselves,” said Michael Pachter, a video games analyst with Wedbush Securities. “It’s just a different society now.” Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.

Science,458," By BENEDICT CAREYMARCH 5, 2018 In the wake of the horrific school shootings in Parkland, Fla., President Trump has called repeatedly for building or reopening mental institutions. Strangely, perhaps, he has echoed an argument made by some experts who study the mental health care system. It’s not that they believe that having more institutions would somehow prevent spree killings, as Mr. Trump apparently does. The majority of these murderers appear to be angry, antisocial individuals — with access to guns — whom the mental health system probably could not have spotted in advance. The proposal to bring back asylums — in a modern, transparent form — is very much alive for other reasons among some policy experts, psychiatrists and bioethicists.  But a modern incarnation does not impress advocates for people with mental disabilities, who want the very idea dead and buried, along with transorbital lobotomy, insulin-shock therapy and other cruelties visited on people with mental disorders in times past.  The intensity of this debate — and the rare points of agreement between partisans — provide a guide to the maze of the American mental health care system for anyone trying to navigate it while watching a loved one sink into delusion, mania or suicidal despair. “When people are going back and forth from prisons to hospitals, that’s a sign they might have benefited from longer-term treatment options,” said Dominic Sisti, a medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine who was co-author of a 2015 paper subtitled “Bring Back the Asylum” in the journal JAMA. “For this really seriously mentally ill population, our resources have dried up, and I find that to be an ethical social-justice violation,” he said. Yet Jennifer Mathis, the director of policy and legal advocacy at the Bazelon Center, which litigates on behalf of those with mental disabilities, called the idea offensive on its face. “It took a lot of effort to move away from the practice of warehousing people,” she said. “Locking people up long-term is no treatment at all. The idea that we could be going back to those days — we did this before, and it failed and failed badly — it’s crazy and discriminating.” One thing few experts dispute: soul-crushing abuses have occurred in mental institutions, and still do, across the world. The first therapeutic asylums, established in Europe at the beginning of the 19th century, were just that: asylums, retreats, closer to present-day yoga spas than clinics. They coincided roughly with the founding of what is now modern psychiatry.  Through the 1800s, Quakers in the United States established retreats based on a similar principle: that respite and patient care were the best remedy for “mental breakdowns” of all kinds. The first mental hospitals were intended to provide a humane, protective environment, too, and there were “pockets of decency” in many of them, the late Dr. Oliver Sacks wrote in the New York Review of Books — especially in facilities that pursued some semblance of the Quaker example. But these institutions, particularly the state hospitals, soon became repositories for society’s unwanted and adrift, alcoholics, the indigent and vagrant, mixed in with those experiencing psychosis and severe mood problems. Funding tapered off through the first half of the 20th century. Staffs shrank, and in some facilities, a single doctor was responsible for hundreds of residents, who often lived in squalid, abusive, dangerous conditions. For many, there was no path out, nowhere else to go. Hospitalization was a life sentence, or close to it. “It is hard to describe the smell,” said Joseph Rogers, 66, executive director of the National Mental Health Consumers’ Self-Help Clearinghouse, who spent stretches of up to six months on locked wards, mostly in Florida, after a psychotic episode at age 19. “I guess it is the smell of caged humans. Someone once told me that part of the smell comes from the medication everyone is on.” He added: “You’re told when to go to bed, where to go, what to eat and when. They take all your freedom away, and in my eyes they’re not placed where you get any help.” He later founded the clearinghouse, which provides assistance and advocacy for people with psychiatric diagnoses.  By 1960, doctors had the first drug that could effectively blunt psychosis — chlorpromazine, brand name Thorazine — giving tens of thousands of residents a chance to live independently. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy initiated the Community Mental Health Act, intended to end institutional abuses and create a system of community-based care.      The idea was that those released from the institutions would move back into neighborhoods, with easy access to a doctor, therapists, at-home services if needed. The money saved by closing the hospitals would be used to support independent living. The downstream consequences of that legislation are now generally accepted. State governments, with some exceptions, did not make good on promises to provide adequate community care, like well staffed local clinics, supports for housing, employment and daily living. Under budgetary strain, they offloaded much of the expense of mental health care to federal programs like Medicaid. Homelessness swelled in the nation’s cities well through the 1980s. In more recent decades, an increasing number of people with mental disabilities landed in prison, usually for nonviolent offenses. Today there are at least 100,000 inmates with psychosis, far more if those with severe mood problems and drug problems are included, experts estimate. During this time, the number of public psychiatric beds available has plunged, to 11 per 100,000 people from 360 per 100,000 in the 1950s, according to Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center, which lobbies for more investment in psychiatric beds for people with severe mental illness. “There’s simply nowhere to put people with severe mental illness to stabilize them,” Dr. Torrey said. “No one seemed to care enough a generation ago, when so many become homeless,” he added. “Now that they’re going to prison, well, these are horrendous tragedies, and if there were beds available, you wonder how many of these tragedies could be avoided.” Dr. Torrey estimated that more than 90 percent of people with psychosis could be stabilized and discharged within a few weeks or so — that is, with short-term or acute care. This is a clinical point on which both sides of the debate generally agree: Many people with psychosis need acute care in a hospital, finding the treatments that help before returning to their families. The loss of psychiatric beds means less care of this type is available in many areas.  Dr. Torrey parts ways with opponents of asylums in that he favors longer-term institutionalization for the 5 percent or so who do not improve with acute care, along “with continual, unannounced inspections” to prevent abuses. The third, and perhaps most critical, point of agreement in the asylum debate is that money is lacking in a nation that puts mental health at the bottom of the health budget. These disorders are expensive to treat in any setting, and funds for hospital care and community supports often come out of the same budget. In his paper arguing for the return of asylums, Dr. Sisti singled out the Worcester Recovery Center and Hospital in Massachusetts. This $300 million state hospital, opened in 2012, has an annual budget of $80 million, 320 private rooms, a range of medical treatments and nonmedical supports, like family and group therapy, and vocational training. Its progress is closely watched among mental health experts. The average length of stay for adolescents is 28 days, and the average for continuing care (for the more serious cases) is 85 days, according to Daniela Trammell, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health. “Some individuals are hospitalized for nine months to a year; a smaller number is hospitalized for one to three years,” she wrote in an email. Proponents of modern asylums insist that this kind of money is well spent, considering the alternatives for people with mental disabilities in prison or on the streets. Opponents are not convinced. “When you set up a place like Worcester, one issue is there are no eyes on, no one outside watching, and that becomes an invitation to abuse,” said David J. Rothman, a historian at Columbia University. He and Sheila M. Rothman, his wife, wrote “The Willowbrook Wars,” the definitive account of the notorious Willowbrook State School on New York’s Staten Island, which closed in 1987.  It costs some $150,000 or more annually to house a resident at modern state mental facilities like Worcester, compared to about $30,000 a year for good community care, including housing, experts estimate. “The more you spend on these hospitals, the less is available for community care,” Dr. Rothman said. At the heart of the modern debate over new asylums are two questions awaiting answers: What is good mental health care, really? And what does its quality say about the society attempting to provide it? Follow @NYTHealth on Twitter. | Sign up for the  Science Times newsletter.

                MARCH 7, 2018 Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Despite the fierce winter storm that brought an avalanche of snow to the Sierra Nevada last week, water officials say the state’s snowpack is far behind its desired level. Before the storm, comparisons were being made to record-breaking dry years. So why isn’t there more panic about a potential drought? The state’s reservoir levels and drinking water supply are in good shape, largely because last year was exceptionally wet, said Dave Rizzardo, of the California Department of Water Resources. Last week’s storm nearly doubled the snowpack — and although that brought it up to only 34 percent of what’s typically desired by April 1, it has eased comparisons to the record lows in 1977 and 2015. (The state gets about 30 percent of its fresh water from the snowpack each year.) “It still is what it is, but it’s a nice boost. It doesn’t get us necessarily out of a horrible snowpack condition but there are more storms that could chip away at that deficit,” Mr. Rizzardo said. “This could be a worse conversation if last year wasn’t so wet.” The news and stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state). Sign up to get it by email.     Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A., warned that the current water levels don’t tell the full story about the year. Despite last week’s snowstorm, which he said effectively doubled the amount of available water stored in the snowpack, the low yearly precipitation could have secondary ecological impacts and wildfire risks.  “We are always looking for the saving grace in California, the last-minute storm or series of storms that sort of saves the day and closes the gap for the water year,” he said. “Is this a miracle March? Is this an awesome April? Is this a miraculous turn around? It’s amazing how often we ask that question here. I think we’ve come to rely on it a little bit too much.”  He added that it was difficult to know what next year might bring in terms of rain and snowpack, and pointed out that many towns and areas that aren’t connected to the state water system are subject to limited water availability. “I think that gets to the heart of the issue,” Mr. Swain said. “How do we define ‘drought?’ There are different definitions formally, but I think in a practical sense it can mean a lot of things depending on your perspective.” Mr. Rizzardo urged Californians to remain mindful of how much water they are using. “Water conservation is a way of life in Southern California. But with a little precipitation, they get a little rain and they think, ‘We can run our sprinklers again!’” he said. “The day after we have our first good rainstorm, and I see my neighbor watering his lawn, I’m thinking, ‘Oh, god.’” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • The Justice Department is suing California over its sanctuary laws.

NYTNow,460," By CHRIS STANFORDMARCH 8, 2018  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump is set to sign sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports this afternoon, under a legal provision that allows him to take actions to defend national security. More than 100 Republican lawmakers urged the president to drop the plan, which would initially exempt Canada, the largest source of steel and aluminum for the U.S., and Mexico. Washington is linking the exemptions to renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The proposal has raised fears of retaliation. “Choosing a trade war is a mistaken prescription,” China’s foreign minister said today. (Our senior economics correspondent calls it more of a “skirmish.”) • Gary Cohn, the top economic adviser who just resigned, was a vocal opponent of the protections. The exodus of White House advisers is increasingly leaving the president to follow his instincts, our correspondents write. • Ignoring his lawyers’ advice, President Trump asked key witnesses in the Russia inquiry what they had discussed with investigators, according to people familiar with the encounters.  Legal experts said the contacts, with Donald McGahn, the White House counsel, and with Reince Priebus, his former chief of staff, most likely did not amount to witness tampering. The White House didn’t respond to several requests for comment.  • Separately, President Trump’s lawyer  secretly obtained a temporary restraining order last week to prevent Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic-film star known as Stormy Daniels, from speaking about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump. • Three weeks after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., most gun safety proposals appear to be going nowhere on Capitol Hill. Republican leaders are shifting instead toward measures to increase security at American schools. Democrats and advocates of gun control accuse Republicans of diverting attention from the proliferation of weapons. • In Florida, however, the House defied the National Rifle Association on Wednesday, passing a $400 million gun control and school safety bill that’s on its way to the governor. Here’s what’s in the measure. Just three weeks after the Parkland school shooting, Gov. Rick Scott has signed into law Florida’s most aggressive gun reform in recent years. • Months after a series of missile tests raised fears of war, a smiling Kim Jong-un surprised South Korean officials this week with a willingness to start talks with the U.S. on ending his nuclear program. “He seems to be evolving into a strategic thinker with a game plan instead of a bomb thrower,” Bill Richardson, a veteran U.S. diplomat, said. “What we need to be worried about is this: Is he setting up a trap for all of us?” • The prospect of negotiations — even if they fail — is welcome in China, which is eager to avoid war on its border. President Trump said that protections on steel and aluminum imports were in the interest of national security. But could the threat be the tariffs themselves? • The Chinese company Huawei  is determined to lead 5G mobile technology, and that’s worrying Washington. “Whoever controls the technology knows, intimately, how it was built and where all the doors and buttons are,” a consultant in Beijing said.  • In a rare interview, Peter Thiel, a billionaire investor and Facebook board member, spoke to The Times about politics, Silicon Valley and “a crazier two years than I would have thought.” • U.S. stocks were mixed on Wednesday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today.

Today is International Women’s Day, and we’d like to recognize a group of 223 women. In 1917, on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War I, Washington drafted 2.8 million men into military service. The Army realized that its success would rely on the Allies’ use of a new technology: the telephone. Enter the Hello Girls, a group of bilingual telephone operators selected for working the switchboards in France, connecting the front lines with supply depots and military command. They often handled more than 150,000 calls a day. But because they were women, the U.S. government denied them veteran status for more than 60 years after the war. “The unfortunate reality is their service wasn’t officially recognized with veteran status until 1979, when a small fraction of those who served were still alive,” Doran Cart, a senior curator at the National World War I Museum and Memorial, said. “To achieve that point of hard-won recognition took a monumental effort.” Remy Tumin contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

Learning,461," Supported by Current Events Conversation By The Learning Network This week we enjoyed reading comments from hundreds of students across the United States — from New York and Florida to California and Ohio. We’d like to acknowledge longtime participants from YC CLIP, Locust Grove High School in Locust Grove, Ga., and Hoggard High School in Wilmington, N.C., for weighing in strongly this week. And, we want to give a special shout out to Tucker G. Oakley from Wilmington, N.C., who consistently writes entertaining and heartfelt short stories and poems on our Picture Prompts. We look forward to reading them each week! As always, thank you for offering your insightful opinions, sharing your personal experiences and composing creative stories on our many writing prompts. Keep up the great work, everyone! Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ In light of recent events, it was no surprise to us that “Do You Think It Is Important for Teenagers to Participate in Political Activism?” was the most popular writing prompt this week. We received excellent comments from students all over the country who organized and participated in the national student walkouts on March 14, as well as those who chose to opt out. Here are their thoughts on the protest and teenagers’ roles in politics: Kate Silver from Wilmington, N.C., shared her experience: On Wednesday March 14th, thousands participated in Nationwide walkouts to protest gun violence and honor the 17 lives lost in the Parkland shooting. Among the participating schools was mine, Hoggard High School. At 10 am when the protests began, hundreds of students marched to the forum with their voices ready to be heard. I came prepared with my “Arms are for Hugging” t-shirt and “No more silence, end gun violence” written on my poster. 17 students were standing on a wooden bench and came forward one by one, passionately representing each of the 17 victims. The experience was amazing. I felt as though anything was possible and that we could make a difference. Seeing so many students vying for change made me proud of my generation. I felt like my father, who years earlier, marched on Washington to protest the Vietnam War. As a teenager, adults look down on us. They see us as hormonal children that only care about themselves. But during the walkout, we showed them that we will not stay silent and afterwards, they were looking up to us. Sydney Durner from Wilmington, N.C., also participated in the walkout, though for a different reason: Teenagers are usually looked down upon in politics, like our opinion doesn’t matter, we don’t know enough about politics to have a say. It’s important for teenagers to be able to speak out for what they believe in. This enforce good political habits, speaking your mind, standing up for what you believe in, participating in voting, etc. I participated in the walkout on Wednesday, March 14th. I don’t necessarily agree with what my school was preaching about. I went to honor the victims. The walkout turned into a ban guns rally. Guns aren’t the problem, it’s the ones behind the trigger that are the problem. In the article “National School Walkout: Thousands Protest Against Gun Violence Across the U.S.,” they mention a 16 year-old who stayed in class during the protest, saying that banning guns isn’t the issue and that the real issue is the people doing it.” That was his way of participating in political activism. He stayed because it’s what he believed in. Teenagers should participate in political activism. It feels good to be a part of something bigger than you could imagine and trying to make a change in the world. In the article “Why Demonstrating is Good for Kids,” it mentions a study in the journal Child Development, teens and young adults who voted, volunteered, or engaged in activism went farther in school and had higher incomes than those who didn’t advocate for change. It is so important that we develop our voices at a young age. It only helps us in the long run. Leah Schwagerl from Wilmington, N.C., was proud of her classmates: Personally, I am proud of all of the adolescents that participated in the walkouts for gun violence or for memorializing the 17 victims of the Parkland shooting. Even if our efforts to promote change are denied by legislation, at least we were able to experience the unity that comes with standing up for what we believe in. I hope that the nation wide walkout sparked adults to see teenagers in a more respectable way. After all, just a week before the walkout I saw an upsetting post on social media that stated something along the lines of “How am I supposed to listen to teenagers talk about gun laws when earlier this year they were eating tide pods?” To conclude, I can say with pride that after my positive experience from the national school walkout, I plan on being a lot more politically active in the years to come. Political activism allows teenagers, adults, and people in general to align their beliefs and engage in the world. Collin from Lawrence was less impressed with his school’s demonstration: I feel like at my school, Walkout was the wrong term. At my school there was a rally. Disappointed. That was my reaction. Disappointed because instead of being a respectful memorial. It was a political charged anti gun rally. Now, there is nothing wrong with expressing your own political beliefs but school is not the place to hold a political protest. I was under the impression there was going to be 17 minutes of silence but what I got was quite the opposite. People with megaphones, yelling and screaming, chanting. It was far from a memorial. Do I think young people should protest? Yes go right ahead but school is not the place. A large portion of people who went to the “rally” didn’t even know why they were there. Conflicted Ideas about guns swarmed around the place. “Ban all guns!” “Ban Assault Rifles” Some people didn’t even know what they stood for. The worse thing about it is, The school can practicality host an anti gun rally, but if a student walks into class wearing a shirt or a hat that portrays their conservative beliefs or lifestyle, they are asked to take it off. It reminds me of a court case we learned about in Civics. Tinker vs Des Moines. This court case ruled that students have the right to protest as long as they don’t disrupt the learning environment. Although the verdict stands true to this day, I don’t see the law being enforced in America’s High Schools. Kalpana from New York, N.Y., was also confused about the message protesters were sending, but remained hopeful: I’m not sure about the message my school was trying to send. I know that the students and teachers believe gun violence is bad, and I do too, but it confuses me why we were not doing 17 minutes of silence. I wish we had. I thought the walkout was supposed to be for students in Parkland, Florida, and we would be supporting them by walking out and doing 17 minutes of silence and reading their names. Instead, we did 20 minutes of shouting and rallying for gun control. The message we were sending out was not “Parkland we sympathize with you” but “NRA, we’re going to take you down!” I do hope, still, that our rallies help convince Trump to make some gun control laws so there will be fewer incidents involving guns. Though some students doubted the effectiveness of the walkouts, Sydney G. from New York thought they had the potential to make a difference: I think that it was very important that us children, the future of our world went out and stood up for something that we believe in. It is very significant that as individuals at this age that we use our voices, because our opinions are very powerful and influential. I believe that we did make a difference just by going out among millions of others to support the people who have suffered and are still suffering and stand up for what we believe in. When I see photos of the other young adults going out and protesting, I feel proud that there is a group of people who are not afraid to share their true feelings to the nation and that there are people who are willing to protect and support each other no matter how frightening it is. As did Cam from Maine, who hoped young people’s voices wouldn’t be silenced by adults: I think that it is more important than ever for teens to participate in political debates and issues. Sadly, we are the generation that has grown up with mass shootings being a norm, and it needs to stop. I think that students taking a stand will make a difference because we are also the next generation of voters. My school had a snow day on the day of the national walkout so we weren’t able to participate, but from what I saw it got plenty of news coverage and attention, which will help with raising awareness even more. Personally, I also believe that teachers and administrators should allow students to have open, honest conversations about what they believe in without punishment. I also think that is wrong to not allow students to walkout and threaten them for standing up for what they believe in. But Derek Han from San Jose, Calif., thought there were better ways for students to voice their concerns: Many problems are being noticed around the country nowadays such as school shootings, and students may want to protest. Recently, there was a peaceful protest on March 14, where students across the nation walked outside of their classrooms in order to spread awareness about the issue of gun violence in schools. As a student, I didn’t take part in the protest as I believed that walking outside of my classroom for 17 minutes was not the best way to spread awareness about the issue and was not the most efficient way to address nationwide problems. I believe that the idea of teenagers trying to spread their opinions on problems is great, but I just think that there are better ways of accomplishing their goal. Spending class time in order to give respect to the murdered students may not have been the best idea. Letting others know about issues through social media and the internet is a great way to spread awareness and still save class time for learning. While the intentions of protesting students or teenagers may be good, I think that some teenagers may be more prone to act on their emotions, and I feel that teenagers may cause something similar to a riot if their opinions are not agreed upon, or if their actions are not recognized. Many students were passionate about teenagers’ involvement in politics, like Hugo Veliz from Providence, R.I., who wrote: Personally, if the teenagers are being active in political issues, we see different aspects and different views on problems being discussed today. Also, what would happen if the issues being discussed today are about the teenagers and the youth? How could they not be apart of that discussion if they are the discussion. For example, the tragic shootout that recently happened in Florida. Would those in danger be silent and not say what is on their mind? It would be unjust. The teenagers of today will be those making those influential decisions of tomorrow. Being quiet will not only danger today, it will also danger the future. Nelly3D from YC CLIP agreed: These days is very important to raise our voices to get changes. I think is important to teach the teenager to participate in political activism because some teenagers do not how good or bad is to fight to get some positive change. Nowadays, some of our teenagers do not know how to choose good decisions, because some parents do not allow that their children grow independently, this makes us create children unable to make their own decisions. Some of them are influence negatively of bad persons. However, some teenager are more mature than an adult. I think that we have to allow the teenagers participate in different way like political activism in this way in this way they get involved in positive things so that they grow up to be wise people with a lot of knowledge and they can take advantage of it in the future. If we want to see in the future good resolve for this country, we as parents have to educate our children. They are our future. Robert Yates from Wilmington, N.C., argued that civic participation is one of the most important things citizens — young and old — can do for their country: I believe that the willingness of teenagers to take a stand against the government is the most important factor in regards to the reversal of the socioeconomic damage previous generations have dealt to our country and planet. I participated in the walkout last week at my high school along with hundreds of others. Many people, though, opted out of the protest to sit in class and do nothing for seventeen minutes. These people have their reasons, the vast majority of which I disagree with, however the one excuse I heard from a few people that frustrated me the most was that they didn’t “waste their time” because “one person won’t make a difference”. This mindset is the antithesis of meaningful change, which is also shared by people such as those that abstain from exercising their right as an American citizen to vote. As the study referenced in the first article stated, both voting and participating in political activism have a high correlation with going far in school and higher incomes, most likely because proactivity lends itself to success more so than complacency. As far as school staff are concerned, I believe they should remain neutral on the topic and allow students to make their own decisions. I felt pressured to not participate last week because my teacher was clearly biased against the protesters. When school staff share their opinion, it can scare students into doing the opposite of what they believe in, which isn’t a good way to acclimate students to taking a stand. _________ Students responded to our Student Opinion question “What Is Your Favorite Type of Art?” with the art and museum exhibits that have moved them most. Brianna Browning from Wilmington, N.C., enjoys painting: As a painter I enjoy the instant gratification of the colours. However my favorite type of art is underwater “landscaping”; fish tank decorating. No this doesn’t mean Sponge Bob ornaments, but rather live plants and rocks. I currently have a 75 gal aquarium in which I am turning into a self sustainable tank. I currently have moss and anarchis as a foundation for the root mat. In this aquarium I have three freshwater angelfish, two bala sharks, and one chinese algae eater. This will be a hard project as both the angelfish and bala sharks eat live foods. Making this a difficult and demanding type of art as well. The instant gratification is still here, but you also get the rewards of delayed gratification. You also will watch the plants grow and take shape making this a very natural serene piece of art. Grant Holland from Wilmington, N.C., prefers art that has a purpose: I tend to favor artwork that shows meaning. Anyone can just paint, sculpt or take a picture of something, but what is hard is to show the audience your view and meaning through the art. I usually do not attend art museums, but instead I read the National Geographic magazine or watch the Discovery channel which contains videos and photography that is breathtaking. Discovery and National Geographic do not just run around taking pictures of anything. They take pictures of things that show meaning, like understanding the harsh life of someone who lives in Cuba which shows the reader the importance of freedom. Or watching an animal rescue program release an animal back into the wild that has recovered from injury which shows that humans can make a change on animal life. Art needs to have a meaning, to make a successful piece of artwork, give it life. Jordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., also favors art with cultural significance: I like art that evolves and follows the times that we are living in. Graffiti art is one of my favorites, along with political art and graphic designs. Art is no longer just a painting of fruit, it is one of the most valuable tools used to express ideas. Something that conveys a reaction out of the viewer, that is provocative and eye opening is art in it’s most pure of form. Sarah Dill from Maine appreciates the variety of interpretations different media invite: I like to experience art because it kind of gives you a different perspective. There are so many different forms of art that you could have one topic and there could be so many different perspectives on it. I also like it because it’s cool to look at and you can interpret the meaning of the piece and what the artist was going for.  Shaunna Dancause from Massachusetts uses technology to get a museum experience at home: With the internet making what seems to be everything so readily available, art can be viewed without needing to look at a book or go to a museum. For instance, I spend lots of time looking at art on Instagram. It is especially exciting because you can discover young and underappreciated artists that you wouldn’t have the joy of knowing about otherwise. That being said, it is a very different experience compared to visiting a museum. Being able to see art up close and personal is the best way to view it. My favorite type of art is definitely illustration because it almost always breaks the norms of realism. Even at seventeen, I enjoy looking at children’s picture books for the illustrations. It doesn’t matter whichever method you are using to look at the art, all that matters is that you’re able to appreciate it. John Burgee from Wilmington, N.C., thinks our world would be boring without the gift of art: My favorite piece of art was Kehinde Wiley’s “Margaret, Countess of Blessington.” I liked this painting for it’s uniqueness and realism which I find to be important in a successful work of art. Although I’ve only been to an art museum once or twice I can consider myself a good drawer and I can recognize a good drawing/painting when I see one. _________ For our “Extreme Times, Extreme Clothes” Picture Prompt, we asked what you think fashion says about culture — if anything at all. Emma Claire Lisk from Wilmington, N.C., thinks that, as with all art forms, fashion can make a statement about the world we live in: My friends and I participated in a local fashion contest where the entire outfit was produced from books. But, one of my friend’s creations truly showed the mindset of a fashion designer. Towards her waist, one side had black spikes and the other had a soft feathered curve. She used these additions to display the tensions between people in society. Current events have affected fashion since the 20th century. It has been shown through Martin Margiela in the ‘80s, the time of the infamous stock market crash called Black Monday, by pushing his designs to be “purposefully made to look poor — because the world suddenly was.” Olivia Rotondo from Philadelphia sees fashion more as a personal choice: Fashion is a way that people express themselves. People use outfits to represent who they are. I think that what people personally chose to wear does not reflect what is happening in the world. Some people would rather wear sweats and some people would rather wear jeans, it is just a preference between people. Andrew Derushia from Wilmington, N.C., noted that clothes have helped propel significant cultural shifts throughout history: Times change fast nowadays. We were one thing and it out of style in two weeks. I feel this fast paced world is a result of how we change as humans in our many ever-evolving ways. Clothes have always represented something for it’s wearers. In the late 1700’s the rich would envelope themselves in rare animals skins and elaborate colorful dyed fabrics. All this superfluous clothing would depict the wealth of these people. Today the wealth in clothing is still seen but not nearly as much. We see less of a gap because clothes are more attainable for those “ballin on a budget”. Clothes today also have swayed away from belonging to one gender allowing this cross over to show how society’s acceptance has grown for those who don’t want to follow their gender stereotypes allow them to explore brighter colors, fun cuts, and patterns of clothes originally designated for a sole purpose. The closing gaps between men and women, rich and wealth, and black and white has allowed our communities to grow more unified while still allowing one to express themselves. Fashion overall has helped express the need for dismembering concepts that have configured a larger divide between different groups and allowed us to be seen as more equals with a nice pop of color to show everyone who we truly are. _________ Students wrote their own short stories and poems inspired by the Picture Prompt “Tape.” Morgan from North Carolina created a back story for the image: The children knew they needed to help their cat. The cat’s tail had been cut when she was after a red bird. The bird had decided to fight back this time. The children figured they should tape the cat’s tail, but literally got too wrapped up in their work to accomplish much the first time. They finally managed to do the job and were almost able to get away with it. Mandi from North Carolina began her story this way: Leah, Cassie, and George were sitting on their couch, bored, not being able to do anything because the storm had caused the power to go out, making the tv go out and their phones and laptops dead. Their mother was stuck in traffic where a car had crashed from going too fast on the road. “I’m bored, what should we do?” George asked, laying on the floor looking up at the ceiling. After a few minutes of silence, Cassie, the middle child, jumped up. “What if we played with Ms. Lake’s cats, there is one outside!” “Yeah,” Leah, the oldest child answered. “we’d be doing the cat a favor and getting her out of the rain anyway.” After getting the cat out of the rain, which George was left to do the job, losing a rock paper scissors fight. Cassie ran out of the bathroom with some bandages. “Let’s make a cat mummy!” she yelled, a beaming smile on her face. The siblings soon had the bandages everywhere, more on themselves than the cat. They heard the door open. “What are you guys doing? Why is there a cat?” Their mother was shocked. “We were bored, and the cat was outside, so we brought her in and tried to make her into a mummy.” George replied. “if you were bored you could’ve played board games! I told you this over the phone!” “Oh yeah.” the children said, looking at their feet. Tucker G. Oakley from Wilmington, N.C., interpreted the tape as a metaphor in his poem: Life is a constant feeling of suffering. You are beaten and bruised by all variables. Yet, we survive with every scab to show. By hand of another or the will of Earth. By choice or not, we stride. So show me some bandages, Your endless tape wrapped around Every drop of blood and wound that Paves your pathway. Give me some proof that you are alive, Even seven feet under, show me the tape. Show me the band aids you gave to Those precious to you, so they know. Oh! Let them know that this world Is a battle that you survived And give them the sight through Their unknown. Now go tell them, Never hide your tape. _________ Our Picture Prompt ""A Wrinkle in Time"" brought the following responses: Sean from Sacramento imagined this: It would have been amazing if Oprah had included herself in her list of Earth’s best “warriors.” Hayley DeArmond said more could be done to make the film enjoyable: There are a lot of problems with making film adaptations of popular books. Directors and writers are largely limited by things such as in the case as A Wrinkle in Time not including the book’s scientific theories. Since the story already has been heard, filmmakers are pressured to make it stay as true to the source material as possible, but that is what it is: source material. Ava DuVernay tries to add an artist touch with the casting, but I do not think it does enough to make the film enjoyable. To those who read the book, parts are missing; but the efforts to make the film like the book also made it confusing and not answer a lot of questions to those who did not read the book. An important thing to think about is the movie I, Robot is based on a series of short stories, and The Minority Report was based on short story. Many people do not realize how little of a book you can fit in a movie, but short stories give that message, characters, and setting to make something good. Speaking of The Minority Report it was directed by Steven Spielberg, not just one of the best directors, but directors of film adaptations. War Horse, Catch Me If You Can, The Color Purple, Jurassic Park, Schindler’s List, Jaws, the list keeps going; the most notable thing is Spielberg finds the importance of the story and expresses it his own way in film, he is not debating which chapters to include or characters to cut, he is creating a film _________ Here is what two students said for our Picture Prompt “March Madness”: Rex Hardy from Wilmington, N.C., is a regular bracket participant: I’ve done the March Madness Bracket Challenge with friends over the past couple of years and it never turns out the way I’ve predicted it. This year in particular, I had Virginia in the Final Four and North Carolina winning the whole shebang. After this past weekend, my bracket was destroyed by teams I’ve never heard of, terrible blowouts, and crazy buzzer beaters. It’s March Madness for a reason; which, is one thing I fail to understand year after year. I always predict the higher ranked team winning the majority of the games with only one or two upsets, yet I’m always proven wrong. The Cinderella story always finds a way to mess up what I had planned. This year is definitely up for grabs. Deep inside, I agree with Josh Nagel in that Duke has the best team and is the biggest threat to win it all; yet, I could definitely be wrong. If this year has proved anything to me it is that anybody can be beat on any given day. Virginia, being the favor to win it all by experts and millions of others, were quickly eliminated by a county team. This being said, I believe Texas A&M could win it all with their lineup of two 6’10” forwards, but they might not. The championship is up for grabs and the better team day in and day out is going to win. At this point, the world is wondering, who will it be? Olivia Rotondo from Philadelphia follows the game closely: This 2018 NCAA March Madness has been full of amazing wins and disappointing upsets. As many people pick Virginia or UNC to win it all, most brackets are now busted. I do not follow basketball closely, I know as much as the common person. So, my bracket was not going to get far anyways. I have a place in my heart for Nova. I can’t wait to see who will win this year! _________ For the Student Opinion prompt “What Idea Do You Have That Is Ahead of Its Time?”, a few students recalled famous contemporary innovators. SadiaD4 from YC CLIP named Stephen Hawking as a forward-thinking innovator: The well-known scientist Stephen William Hawking, he was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist and author and he is well known for his future prediction. One of his recent predictions about earth is, ‘Earth will glow red and become as hot as Venus. In July 2017, he told BBC that humanity is at a “tipping point” where global warming would become so bad that Earth become like Venus, with a temperature of 250 degrees Celsius, and raining sulfuric acid’. However, some people think that prediction is not going to happen. They think Venus is so close to the Sun but Earth is not that much close. Furthermore, for the increasing of global warming it could happen in the future. Liubov4D from YC CLIP mentioned Elon Musk: A name of the one person, who could be rightfully named as a person ahead of the present time, comes to my mind. This person’s name is Elon Musk. Inspired by Isaac Asimov’s “Foundation” he tries “to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age and reduce the length of a dark age if there is one.” The same way as sailors roamed the seas, discovering new continents, Musk plans to expand into the space and colonize Mars in 2022. Being bullied in childhood, being sneered as an adult, Elon Musk with the child passion in his soul, is the unique gifted personality, who definitely will influence the existence of all human species. Jessica Brevil from Wekiva High, Apopka, Fla., noted the printer is a time-sensitive invention: Time controls effectiveness of innovation, as seen in the article, which is the reason why the statement that “Ideas do not exist only on their own merits. Timing matters.”. The fact is that certain things are simply not needed for their time. A printer was not needed centuries before the adoption of education systems and this innovation would seem useless in the past while it is essential in modern schools. _________ “Is Childhood Today Too Risk-Free?” was our second most popular prompt of the week. Students were mostly in agreement that childhood is too risk-free, although many said their own parents encouraged some kinds of risk, so didn’t count themselves in the overly protected category. Other students were aghast at the images of the playground in the article, and hoped for more of a natural and safer playground setting for children. Alyssa from Georgia said childhood is sterilized today: I think kids should learn about and experience risk at a young age, so they learn from it and won’t make that mistake again. I do think childhood is really sterilized today, parents should let their child have a little freedom to make mistakes and learn from them. Haleigh from Georgia said children learn from their mistakes: When I was a kid and played on the play ground it was safe to play on but we still managed to get hurt. Although we got hurt, we learned from it and never did the same thing again. I think this play ground is a little too risk taking for kids to play on but I also agree to making play ground a little risk just so the kids can learn from their mistakes. When you introduce risk at a young age kids learn at an early age to where they won’t do it again. I have been exposed to risk but I think I could’ve and should’ve been exposed to more; I would’ve learned more from my mistakes than I do because I haven’t been in those risky situations. With that being said I believe that this play ground is a good idea for young kids to be exposed to risks that they can learn from. Sneezy from Kaiserslautern, Germany, said risk is good for children: I feel that childhood today is too risk-free. The playgrounds that I grew up on were, what I would say, were the standard one; it had the slide, monkey bars, and these little spinny disk things comparable to merry-go-rounds. This playground didn’t compare at all to the “risk-enhanced’ ones. Some of the benefits that these risk-enhanced playgrounds have over traditional ones is that kids will be able to test their limits, how else will they know when to stop? These kids could be building a thin beam to walk across and fall out and hurt themselves. Yes, they did hurt themselves, but they learned that it did, and, hopefully at least, won’t do it again. And honestly, you can hurt yourself on any playground, risky or not. Derrik A. Mullin Jr from Kaiserslautern, Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany, agreed: I’m sick of kids being coddled and having everything sugar coated for them. When I was younger and we had money problems or family issues, I knew and was appreciative of the fact that my parents told me things straight and raw. I learned to keep myself busy with what we had. Now do I like video games and all that new, safe, indoors stuff? Of course I do. That doesn’t mean that playgrounds, sand boxes, mud pies, and wood carving weren’t what made me an early 2000s child, what made me who I am today. I didn’t get my first phone till I was 13 while I now see 6 year-olds with iPhones and tablets in their hands. You’re asking me if I think today’s children live a life too posh? Too risk free? Of course I do! They have everything bad in the world hid from them, they stay inside, they watch TV instead of going out with friends! Nothing is appreciated about the outdoors by the millennials of today, they’re too worried about their makeup, when the next iPhone is gonna come out, or how pretty they look in the mornings. I’m not at all suggesting children shouldn’t have any access to electronics or a somewhat safer environment, or that you should be telling them you’re gonna end up living in a car at the end of the month, but tell them when you don’t have enough money to buy them something, make sure they know how they look matters doesn’t matter and that they’ll always be gorgeous no matter what anyone else says. Bella Cankurtaran from Wilmington, N.C., did not enjoy viewing the images of the playground in the article: I’m pretty sure I shuddered while viewing the images of these British playgrounds. Recess is a time to let out all your energy in a colorful wonderland. The playgrounds these kids are exposed to look like prisons or some sort of war camp. These are children we are talking about! Their mind isn’t fully capable of understanding the risks put in front of them and actually learning from them. We develop that skill over time. Even today, I still make the same mistakes and get hurt each time. The article reported that a placard for Princess Diana Playground purposely provides risks “‘so that your child can develop an appreciation of risk in a controlled play environment rather than taking similar risks in an uncontrolled and unregulated wider world’”. No matter how much adult supervision there is, they can’t keep an eye on every child. Children get hurt on a regular playground so getting hurt on the British playgrounds will be a severely worse case. Nothing will stop kids from doing crazy things. They don’t know what to expect if they jump off a wooden crate or run their finger along the “sharp-edged tape dispenser”, and making that an option for them at this age can be fatal. Each day these children are exposed to danger that could possibly end their life and they can’t learn from that if they’re dead. Mary Wells from Wilmington, N.C., said exposure is very important to growth: When I was a child, I always looked forward to going outside to play with my friends on the playground. My favorite part was being able to swing like an animal across the monkey bars and see how far I could go in 30 seconds. Today, looking at this article, I find playgrounds in Europe are changing what we used to know as playgrounds into ones that have high risk factors. This is scary for younger children, who need security in their early years. Introducing risk factors not only shows them that it is okay to wander onto these dangerous sites, but also that it is encouraged. Children are at the stage where their minds are constantly changing and they hold on to information they receive. I believe that they should not be exposed to this environment at a young age because it teaches them that they should take high risks. In some situations, this is beneficial because they learn to take chances and not be afraid to try new things, but it also could be very dangerous for these little humans, who have not been in this world for very long. We take the time to show younger kids innocent videos and television, so why would we expose them to an environment that is not safe? anon1010 from Cincinnati said a feeling of being independent from adults is important for children: I think suburban areas are too sterilized. City kids still have opportunity for risk in their built environment and rural kids still have the unprotected woods for risky play. When I was in school, all the playground equipment was installed on asphalt — no rubber mats or mulch. Kids would jump off from the swings at the height of the swing or the merry-go-round at its fastest and land on pavement. There were occasional skinned knees, but no serious injuries. The bolder and more athletic would go on to more daring feats and everyone else learned their limits. The drawback of returning some risk is litigation. I grew up in the 70’s and I think I had the right amount of risk and freedom. It allowed me to separate from the adults in my life. Without risk during the young years, it seems that teens have been infantilized and are reluctant to try more adult activities (i.e. driving).

Washington,462," By MICHAEL D. SHEAR, SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and THOMAS KAPLANMARCH 1, 2018 WASHINGTON — The top lobbyist for the National Rifle Association claimed late Thursday that President Trump had retreated from his surprising support a day earlier for gun control measures after a meeting with N.R.A. officials and Vice President Mike Pence in the Oval Office. The lobbyist, Chris Cox, posted on Twitter just after 9 p.m. that he met with Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence, saying that “we all want safe schools, mental health reform and to keep guns away from dangerous people. POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don’t want gun control. #NRA #MAGA.” Mr. Trump tweeted about an hour later, “Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA!” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, declined to provide details about the previously unannounced meeting. A spokeswoman for the N.R.A.’s lobbying arm, which Mr. Cox leads, did not respond to requests for further comment.  But the twin tweets suggest that it may have taken the gun rights group only a little over a day to persuade the president to back away from his apparent embrace of gun control during a remarkable, televised meeting on Wednesday with members of Congress.  In that meeting, Mr. Trump called for comprehensive legislation that would, among other things, expand background checks to firearms purchased at gun shows and on the internet — a measure favored by Democrats but anathema to the N.R.A. He also stunned lawmakers from both parties by suggesting that he would support measures to allow the authorities to seize guns from mentally ill people or those who could pose a danger without first following due process, like appearing before a judge. “I like taking the guns early,” he said, adding, “Take the guns first, go through due process second.” The reaction from the N.R.A.’s allies on Capitol Hill to those comments was fierce the next day, as conservatives vowed that such measures would not become law regardless of Mr. Trump’s declarations. Polls show solid support for stricter laws, especially after mass shootings. But there is also deep disagreement, staunch opposition and growing disenchantment with gun control. But Mr. Trump kept mostly quiet on the subject Thursday. In a morning tweet, he said that “many ideas, some good & some not so good,” had been discussed at the session on Wednesday, and he again endorsed the idea of improving background checks. He added, “Respect 2nd Amendment!” Mr. Cox, in his post Thursday night, singled out due process as something Mr. Trump supports — a suggestion that Mr. Cox had explained to the president that conservatives would revolt against gun seizures by the government without due process. On Wednesday, Democrats and gun control activists had expressed hope, as well as skepticism, about Mr. Trump’s surprising support for legislation to more strictly regulate guns — something that the Republican Party and the N.R.A. have long opposed.  By Thursday night, several expressed resignation to the late-night statements by the president and Mr. Cox. “Unsurprising, but no less revolting,” tweeted Matt Bennett, a longtime advocate of gun control and a top official at a center-left Washington think tank, in response to Mr. Cox’s comment. On Capitol Hill earlier Thursday, a number of Republicans sought to distance themselves from Mr. Trump’s remarks at the Wednesday session. Some who voted against legislation in 2013 that would have expanded background checks said Mr. Trump had said nothing that changed their minds. And several party newcomers, who were not present for the emotional debate prompted by the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., said they could not support such a bill.      “So far there’s been a lot of chopping, but I don’t see any chips flying, and I don’t think that’s going to change,” said Senator John Kennedy, a freshman Republican from Louisiana known for his colorful analogies. Others were more to the point. “He has not changed my mind,” said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia. In a sign that there will be no rush to advance gun legislation, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, told reporters that he had no intention of bringing a gun measure to the Senate floor next week. And Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, dismissed Wednesday’s White House meeting as a “brainstorming session” that would not dictate policy. Mr. Cornyn is the chief sponsor of the so-called Fix NICS Act, which would incentivize states and federal agencies to improve their reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, for gun purchases. The measure, which people on both sides of the gun debate agree is modest, has 49 sponsors in the Senate. Mr. Cornyn has said he would like his legislation to serve as a “base bill” that could be a starting point for a debate in which other senators could offer amendments.  But even the Fix NICS Act is facing a hurdle: Mr. McConnell cannot sidestep Senate rules to bring it to the floor quickly for a vote because unanimous consent is required to do so, and at least one senator, Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, has objected. And at least one Democratic senator, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said Democrats might seek to block a stand-alone Fix NICS bill, because it does not go far enough. Congress passed similar legislation in 2007, after the massacre at Virginia Tech. But lapses persist. For example, the Air Force failed to report a domestic violence court-martial to the F.B.I. that could have prevented a Texas gunman from purchasing a weapon before killing 26 people in a Texas church last November. Mr. Cornyn began the push for his legislation after that massacre. “I think that we’ve come to the conclusion that Fix NICS alone would be a mockery of the magnitude of the problem and also the seismic shift in public opinion around this issue,” Mr. Blumenthal said. Gun control has long been one of the most divisive and emotional issues in Washington. The issue is front and center again after the mass shooting last month at a high school in Parkland, Fla. In addition to embracing expanded background checks, Mr. Trump had called on Wednesday for measures to keep guns from mentally ill people, secure schools and restrict gun sales for some young adults. At one point, he even suggested a conversation on an assault weapons ban. “It was wild,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Republican in the chamber. With the House out of session on Wednesday and Thursday, senators were left to parse the meaning of the president’s remarks. Picking up on Mr. Trump’s stated desire for broad gun legislation, Senate Democrats rolled out their own set of proposals on Thursday: expanding background checks, banning assault weapons and allowing protective orders to temporarily take away guns from people who have shown signs of being dangerous. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, who outlined the plan, gave Mr. Trump credit for his comments at Wednesday’s meeting but also urged the president to stick to them. Mr. Schumer has ample experience with the president’s shifting demands; in January, Mr. Schumer said that negotiating with him was like “negotiating with Jell-O.” “Words alone will not prevent the next mass shooting,” Mr. Schumer said on Thursday before the late-night tweets. “One public meeting will not close background check loopholes. One hour of television won’t get assault weapons off our streets.” Follow Michael D. Shear, Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Thomas Kaplan on Twitter: @shearm, @SherylNYT and @thomaskaplan.

Opinion,463," Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Tim Kreider As with all historic tipping points, it seems inevitable in retrospect: Of course it was the young people, the actual victims of the slaughter, who have finally begun to turn the tide against guns in this country. Kids don’t have money and can’t vote, and until now burying a few dozen a year has apparently been a price that lots of Americans were willing to pay to hold onto the props of their pathetic role-playing fantasies. But they forgot what adults always forget: that our children grow up, and remember everything, and forgive nothing. Those kids have suddenly understood how little their lives were ever worth to the people in power. And they’ll soon begin to realize how efficient and endless are the mechanisms of governance intended to deflect their appeals, exhaust their energy, deplete their passion and defeat them. But anyone who has ever tried to argue with adolescents knows that in the end they will have a thousand times more energy for that fight than you and a bottomless reservoir of moral rage that you burned out long ago. Like most people in middle age, I regard young people with suspicion. The young — and the young at mind — tend to be uncompromising absolutists. They haven’t yet faced life’s heartless compromises and forfeitures, its countless trials by boredom and ethical Kobayashi Marus, or glumly watched themselves do everything they ever disapproved of. I am creeped out by the increasing dogmatism and intolerance of millennials on the left; I felt a generational divide open up under me last year when everyone under 40 seemed to agree that Dana Schutz’s painting of Emmett Till in his coffin should be removed from the Whitney Biennial. When I was young it seemed the natural order of things that conservatives were the prudes and scolds who wanted books banned and exhibitions closed, while we liberals got to be the gadflies and iconoclasts. I know that whenever you disapprove of young people, you’re in the wrong, because you’re going to die and they’ll get to write history, but I just can’t help noticing that the liberal side isn’t much fun to be on anymore. Yet this uprising of the young against the ossified, monolithic power of the National Rifle Association has reminded me that the flaws of youth — its ignorance, naïveté and passionate, Manichaean idealism — are also its strengths. Young people have only just learned that the world is an unfair hierarchy of cruelty and greed, and it still shocks and outrages them. They don’t understand how vast and intractable the forces that have shaped this world really are and still think they can change it. Revolutions have always been driven by the young. Ever since Columbine, almost 20 years ago, I’ve absorbed the news of more mass shootings than I can count with an ulcerating rage that gradually scabbed over into deadened cynicism. To those of us who have lived with certain grim realities our whole adult lives — the widening moat between the rich and the rest of us, the sclerotic influence of money on politics, the N.R.A.’s unassailable coalition of greed and fear — they seem like facts of life as unalterable as death itself. I’d come to the conclusion that America has always been a violent nation, from our founding genocide to the slave labor that built the country to the arsenal, unprecedented in human history, that maintains our empire. We spend $60 billion a year on pets but won’t go to any inconvenience to keep second graders from getting slaughtered. Despite all our competitive parenting and mommy machismo and trophy kids, we don’t really give a damn about our children — by which I mean, about one another’s. When a race stops caring for its young, its extinction is not only imminent but well deserved. But maybe my bitter complacence about our civilization’s irreversible decline is just a projection of my feelings about my own. Power is like money: imaginary, entirely dependent upon belief. Most of the power of institutions lies in the faith people have in them. And cynicism is also a kind of faith: the faith that nothing can change, that those institutions are corrupt beyond all accountability, immune to intimidation or appeal. Harvey Weinstein ultimately wasn’t the one enforcing the code of silence around his predations: It was all the agents and managers and friends and colleagues who warned actresses that he was too powerful to accuse. Once people stopped believing in his invulnerability, his destruction was as instantaneous as the middle school queen being made a pariah. Watch: As soon as the first N.R.A. A-rated congressman loses an election, other politicians’ deeply held convictions about Second Amendment rights will start rapidly evolving. The students of Parkland are like veterans coming home from the bloody front of the N.R.A.’s de facto war on children. They’ve seen their friends, teachers and coaches gunned down in the halls. To them, powerful Washington lobbyists and United States senators suddenly look like what they are: cheesy TV spokesmodels for murder weapons. It has been inspiring and thrilling to watch furious, cleareyed teenagers shame and vilify gutless politicians and soul-dead lobbyists for their complicity in the murders of their friends. Last week Wayne LaPierre was reduced to gibbering like Gen. Jack D. Ripper in “Dr. Strangelove” about a “socialist” takeover and “hardening” our schools. You could see the whites all around his irises. That look is fear. One of my students once asked me, when I was teaching the writing of political op-ed essays, why adults should listen to anything young people had to say about the world. My answer: because they’re afraid of you. They don’t understand you. And they know you’re going to replace them. My message, as an aging Gen X-er to millennials and those coming after them, is: Go get us. Take us down — all those cringing provincials who still think climate change is a hoax, that being transgender is a fad or that “socialism” means purges and re-education camps. Rid the world of all our outmoded opinions, vestigial prejudices and rotten institutions. Gender roles as disfiguring as foot-binding, the moribund and vampiric two-party system, the savage theology of capitalism — rip it all to the ground. I for one can’t wait till we’re gone. I just wish I could live to see the world without us.

After a morning of tension and chaos at the White House, President Trump announced plans for stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect “for a long period of time.” The measures would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. At a White House meeting, Mr. Trump told a group of executives that he did not want any nation to be exempted from the order. Stocks dropped as the announcement rattled markets. Above, a steel furnace in Germany. ____ 2. How did Fox News get hold of private texts between Senator Mark Warner, above left, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and a lawyer linked to Russia? The committee has concluded that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee leaked them. Mr. Warner and his Republican counterpart, Senator Richard Burr, above right, were so perturbed by the leak that they went to House Speaker Paul Ryan and expressed concerns about the direction of the committee under Representative Devin Nunes. The messages show that Mr. Warner sought to meet with Christopher Steele, the former British spy behind a dossier of salacious claims about President Trump’s connections to Russia. ____ 3. The school massacre in Parkland, Fla., reignited calls to train and arm teachers, roiling the profession and infuriating gun control advocates. For all the outcry, though, hundreds of school districts across the country — mostly in smaller, rural towns — are already armed. We went to one such place: Sidney, Ohio, above. Highly trained staff members at local schools there have access to handguns locked in biometric safes. Separately, Georgia lawmakers punished Delta for distancing itself from the N.R.A. by passing a bill without a proposed tax break that would have benefited the airline, one of the state’s biggest employers. On “The Daily,” we talk to our White House reporters about President Trump’s change of heart on gun control and the resignation of his communications director, Hope Hicks. ____ 4. Alberto Carvalho, above, who rose from day laborer to superintendent of the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, accepted an offer to become the next New York City schools chancellor. And the next day, he changed his mind, in a dramatic spectacle broadcast live on TV. The sudden turnabout led to cheers in a packed meeting room of the Miami school board — and fury and confusion in New York. ____ 5. The Trump administration is targeting MS-13, the brutal street gang started by Salvadorans in Los Angeles in the ’80s. The authorities say the gang now has 30,000 members, about 10,000 of whom are in the U.S. Above, gang members in a jail in San Salvador. Few dispute the menace that MS-13 presents; its members are known for wielding machetes and killing with abandon. But American police and prosecutors in areas where MS-13 is most active said the heightened focus on the gang has come at the expense of fighting more widespread threats, particularly opioids and human trafficking. ____ 6. President Vladimir Putin of Russia used his annual state of the nation speech to threaten Western nations with a new generation of nuclear weapons, including an “invincible” intercontinental cruise missile. It remains unclear whether that actually exists. ____ 7. China’s National People’s Congress is set to convene. Communist Party censors are scouring the internet to suppress criticism of a proposal, expected to pass, allowing President Xi Jinping to remain in power indefinitely. Among the unlikely targets: the letter N and images of Winnie-the-Pooh (a frequently used Xi avatar). Above, Mr. Xi and Mao seen on trinkets in a souvenir shop. ____ 8. Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, tried to cancel a $31,000 order for a custom dining room set for his office. The walkback came a day after the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee announced an investigation into his interior decorating.

Business,465," Supported by By Richard Fausset and Tiffany Hsu ATLANTA — Delta Air Lines, one of Georgia’s largest private-sector employers, is among the glossiest corporate jewels in the state, contributing billions of dollars a year to the economy. Its hundreds of daily flights in and out of Atlanta’s airport are the main reason Georgia’s capital can brag, with justification, that it is a truly international city. “Delta is the Atlanta international airport, and our airport is, you know, the fuel that generates our commercial community,” said Sam Massell, the city’s former mayor. But prestige, boosterism and corporate coddling — all cherished concepts in Georgia — took a back seat this week to the national debate over gun control. In the wake of the Florida school shooting, the airline announced it was ending a promotional discount with the National Rifle Association, and suddenly found itself in the rare position of being openly dressed down — and potentially punished — by Republicans who control the statehouse. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of Georgia, a Republican who presides over the State Senate and has received an A-plus grade from the N.R.A., joined other conservative lawmakers this week in threatening to remove a $50 million sales tax exemption on jet fuel that some hoped would encourage Delta to open even more routes — and help Atlanta attract even more national and international companies. The conservative backlash highlighted the challenge confronting corporations around the country that are struggling to cater to both ends of America’s increasingly distant political and cultural poles. As pressure from social media and advocacy groups has intensified, and calls for boycotts mount, more than a dozen companies have severed business ties with the N.R.A. since the massacre in Parkland, Fla. Just as quickly, a counteroffensive arose from gun supporters excoriating the companies for their stance, forcing business leaders to navigate the treacherous ground where social responsibility, ideology and financial impact converge. Delta did not respond on Tuesday to Mr. Cagle’s threat or amplify its stance regarding the N.R.A. In a statement over the weekend, the company said its decision to stop offering discounted fares to the N.R.A. “reflects the airline’s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings.” As of Tuesday afternoon, the jet-fuel tax break, while opposed by Mr. Cagle and some other conservative Republicans, had not yet been stripped out of a broader Senate tax bill. Delta chose to end special discounts, but FedEx took a different approach, one that highlighted the delicate balancing act. In a statement Monday, FedEx said it disagreed with the N.R.A.’s stance on civilian access to assault rifles but would continue to offer discounts of up to 26 percent to the group’s members. “We are very clear that, when we set pricing strategy or look to adjust pricing, it is not based on political positions or points of view,” Patrick Fitzgerald, the company’s senior vice president, integrated marketing and communications, said in an interview on Tuesday. “But we do have a very clear corporate position in terms of gun safety and school safety.” In Georgia, the debate has been surprisingly fiery, even in a state long defined by tensions between the liberal metropolis and conservative countryside, and between the values of global corporate culture and those of Southern Republicans. “Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” Mr. Cagle, a leading G.O.P. candidate for governor, wrote in a tweet Monday, in which he announced that he would “kill any tax legislation” that benefited Delta unless it changed its position. State Senator Josh McKoon said in an interview Tuesday that he was put off by Delta’s assertion that it was trying to remain neutral on the guns issue, when it had taken positions on other social topics in the past. “It just came off as very disingenuous,” Mr. McKoon said of Delta’s statement. Referring to Mr. Cagle’s pushback, Mr. McKoon said, “I think he captured the sentiment and the feeling of a lot of Georgians,” who, he said, were frustrated “with Delta weighing in on an issue that has nothing to do with the topic of transportation, for sure.” But Mr. Massell, the former mayor who is president of the Buckhead Coalition, an influential Atlanta business and civic group, called the entire debate “embarrassing.” He said that he feared the threat against Delta would scare away Amazon, the online retail giant that has listed Atlanta among the finalists for its second headquarters. “I don’t believe in blackmail, and I’m sorry to use such a dirty word, but that’s almost what it tastes like,” said Mr. Massell, a Democrat who served as mayor from 1970 to 1974. “That’s terrible. That’s not Georgia’s image. That’s backwoods stuff that doesn’t belong at all.” The story of Delta and the story of Atlanta have been deeply intertwined for decades. The company was founded in Louisiana in the 1920s; it focused, in the earliest days, on crop dusting, in an effort to end the boll weevil infestation that had ruined many Southern cotton crops. The company moved to Atlanta in 1941. In subsequent decades, the city, which was founded as a railroad hub, invested heavily in its airport, and pushed a message that it was more socially tolerant than other Southern cities like Birmingham. It was a winning combination. Today, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the busiest in the world, and Delta employs more than 33,000 Georgia residents. When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat. Its current problem with the legislature has prompted leaders in other states to woo Delta via Twitter. “You know, in mathematics, Delta represents the change in something,” wrote Randall Woodfin, the mayor of Birmingham. He added, “Let’s chat.” Michael Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business and faculty director of the Center for Social Impact, said in an interview that “Delta has every right to tell legislators, ‘We’re not of a mind to do your bidding.’ They could easily pack their bags and move away from Atlanta and go to Dallas.” But it seemed unlikely that the airline would move. In 2016, the company signed an airport lease with the city that would keep its headquarters in Atlanta through 2036. “Atlanta and Georgia and the business community usually try to work together and Delta is a huge employer in this state,” said another former Atlanta mayor, Shirley Franklin. “So the relationship is damaged, if nothing else.” A broader concern, shared by some liberals, conservatives and members of the Georgia business community, is that gun control may now join other hot-button cultural topics that may damage the state’s reputation among national and global corporations that do not adhere to the same conservative Southern values as the state legislature. In the last few years, the legislature has taken up a number of prominent bills that critics say would allow for discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed one of them, a so-called religious liberty bill, in 2016, after some of the state’s most prestigious and powerful companies — including Delta, Home Depot and Coca-Cola — openly opposed the measure. Mr. Deal, a Republican, will soon leave office because of term limits. Mr. Cagle, a leading candidate to replace him, is among a number of Republican hopefuls who say they will continue to support the legislation, which would have strengthened legal protection for opponents of same-sex marriage. Mr. McKoon, a Republican who is leaving the upper chamber to run for secretary of state, said that he had long opposed the jet-fuel tax break on the grounds that it seemed like a handout for a politically connected industry. Mr. McKoon was a vocal supporter of the 2016 religious liberty bill that Mr. Deal vetoed. He said that when that legislation failed, he issued a warning, saying that liberals would continue pressuring companies to embrace progressive social positions. He warned, he said, that “the next logical step would be to attack gun rights. And I think we are seeing the beginning of that.” Richard Fausset and Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @RichardFausset, @tiffkhsu        Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS",2018-02-28,0.0012717994,Wednesday

                FEB. 28, 2018 Updated, 11:38 a.m. Good morning on this energizing Wednesday. One day this month, we woke up to an email from a loyal New York Today reader: “There has been an outbreak of emotional support animals on airlines, but what’s up with the proliferation of pets in the subway? It’s getting out of control. What are the rules around it?” Having recently watched a 70-pound goldendoodle named Augustus leap into a taxi, we, too, were curious. Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, pointed out the agency’s rules of conduct for the subway: “No person may bring any animal on or into any conveyance or facility unless enclosed in a container and carried in a manner which would not annoy other passengers.” (The word “annoy” is, of course, subjective; a “good boy” in one rider’s eyes may be a slobbering monster to another.)  Service animals and dogs working for law enforcement are exempt from the rules, but emotional support animals are not. While it’s impossible to track dog ridership, Detective Kellyann Ort, a police spokeswoman, said, “Any summonses that may be issued for animals present in the transit system are issued infrequently.” Only 85 were issued in 2017, a tiny percentage of the 70,000 total summonses issued across the transit system last year. But if you’d rather stay on the right side of the law regardless, you might consider hailing a taxi. Drivers cannot turn away any person with a disability, or any accompanying guide dog. If it’s not a service animal, though, the driver may deny you if your pet “is not properly secured in a suitable container,” according to the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.  “That’s the answer as addressed in our rules,” Allan J. Fromberg, the group’s deputy commissioner for public affairs, told us. “But needless to say, there are many drivers who, of their own volition, will be more permissive regarding animals.

NYTNow,467," By CHRIS STANFORDFEB. 26, 2018  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The Communist Party has proposed revising China’s Constitution to abolish term limits on the presidency, a move that could allow President Xi Jinping to remain in office indefinitely. It is the boldest move yet by Mr. Xi, who is seeking to strengthen the party’s control and to restore China as a global leader. The Constitution limits Mr. Xi, who became president in 2013, to two five-year terms. We looked at how he came to power. • Government censors rushed to block criticism of the plan, which renewed fears of strongman politics. • Students and parents returned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Sunday for the first time since the mass shooting there that killed 17.  “It’s like the first day of school,” one student said, “but it’s not normal at all.” Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are also back, after a weeklong recess. They face intense pressure to act on gun control, but, as our reporters note, “If the past is prologue, Congress will do nothing.”  • Sheriff Scott Israel defended his “amazing leadership” as questions mounted over his department’s response. At least one deputy failed to enter the school while the shooting was in progress. The Supreme Court today rejected a Trump administration request to hear a case on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program even before an appeals court had ruled on it. The program shields from deportation roughly 700,000 people who were brought to the U.S. as children and allows them to work. In September, the  administration announced that it would shut down the program on March 5. But two federal judges ordered major pieces of the program to be maintained while legal challenges move forward. • A House panel released a redacted memo over the weekend that counters Republican claims of abuses by the F.B.I. and the Justice Department in the Russia investigation. Read the memo here. President Trump blocked the release of the Democratic memo two weeks ago, citing national security concerns. • Here are  five takeaways from the document, which details what the Democrats say were inaccurate claims and omissions in an earlier Republican memo.  • The Winter Games closed in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and the question is now whether signs of a thaw between the two Koreas will last. The South’s president, Moon Jae-in, said today that, while the U.S. and North Korea have indicated a willingness for talks,  they need to soften their stances. We have highlights and photographs from the closing ceremony, and our Olympics team reflected on their favorite moments from the past two weeks. • The U.S. finished with 23 medals, nine of them gold. Here’s the full count. President Trump’s vision dominated at the Conservative Political Action Conference, and, as one woman learned, there was little room for alternative views. • The Weinstein Company will file for bankruptcy after talks about a sale collapsed. The film and TV studio has been struggling since a wave of accusations of sexual misconduct against Harvey Weinstein, a co-owner. • The Supreme Court is to hear a case today that could affect public-sector unions. At issue is whether government employees must pay unions for representing them in collective bargaining. • Balking at “blockchain bros”: Women who have been trying to join the gold rush of virtual currencies are finding a gender divide. • A new round of talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement is among the headlines to watch this week. • U.S. stocks were up on Friday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today. Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.  • Traveling? Here are simple tips to get by if you don’t know the language. • You can weather a turbulent stock market. • Try a meatless meal of Sri Lankan dal with coconut and lime kale. • A new U.N. resolution demanding a cease-fire across Syria appeared to have little effect, as government forces attacked a rebel-held enclave near the capital, Damascus. There were reports on Sunday of a suspected chlorine attack. • After  the deadly school shooting in Florida, a number of companies announced plans to cut ties with the National Rifle Association, ending discount programs for the group’s members. • The authorities in Atlanta announced a $10,000 reward for information about a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employee who disappeared two weeks ago. • Warren Buffett said in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders that it had recorded more than $29 billion in gains from the tax overhaul in December. • “Black Panther” may soon join the $1 billion club. The Marvel superhero movie has earned more than $700 million in global ticket sales in 12 days. • Fortified, but still in peril In the years after Hurricane Katrina, more than 350 miles — and $20 billion — of levees, flood walls, gates and pumps were built to encircle New Orleans. Experts say it’s not enough. The article is part of a special report about the ecological crisis facing Louisiana’s coast, the product of a partnership between The Times and NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune of New Orleans.

Essentially, he has become emperor for life.” — Willy Lam, the author of a 2015 biography of Mr. Xi, on China’s moves to abolish presidential term limits. • The Times, in other words Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. “Was it really that bad?” That’s what Arthur Bicknell asked years after his play, a mystery farce called “Moose Murders,” opened and closed on the same night this month in 1983 — setting a punishing new standard for Broadway flops. “The simple answer,” he conceded to The Times, “is yes.” Reviews  were brutal. Brendan Gill of The New Yorker said it “would insult the intelligence of an audience consisting entirely of amoebas.” Dennis Cunningham of CBS advised, “If your name is Arthur Bicknell, change it.” (In one account, a woman leaving the theater shouted to a police officer, “Arrest this play!”) Here’s the Times review by Frank Rich, who years later would call it “the worst play I’ve ever seen on a Broadway stage.”  In the years since its ill-fated debut, “Moose Murders” has gained notoriety, if not respect. In 2011, Mr. Bicknell published “Moose Murdered: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love My Broadway Bomb.”) In fact, there have been revivals of “Moose Murders” around the world — and at least one comical twist. In 2007, the Repertory Philippines misidentified the author of the play in posters around Manila. Instead of Mr. Bicknell, it credited The Times’s critic, Mr. Rich. Charles McDermid contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning. Browse past briefings here.

Foreign,468," 
                The Interpreter             By                     
                                    AMANDA TAUB
                            
                FEB. 28, 2018 LONDON — There are three kinds of lies, goes the old saying popularized by Mark Twain: “lies, damned lies, and statistics.” That’s been on my mind this month as I’ve watched a big scandal over aid workers’ sexual misconduct unfolding in the British press. It began with an exposé by The Times of London alleging that staff members from the charity Oxfam had paid earthquake survivors in Haiti for sex. But the most attention-grabbing headline in the expanding scandal came from The Sun, which blared that a “bombshell U.N. dossier” found that United Nations aid workers had raped 60,000 people. That is a horrifying number. It is an attention-grabbing number. It is also more or less a made-up number. And it’s got me thinking about which stories get believed, how numbers can become a stand-in for rigor and objectivity, and how that can be a problem.  I called Andrew MacLeod, the author of the document in question, to ask where his data came from. To his credit, Mr. MacLeod, a former United Nations employee who once described himself in his Twitter bio as a “Humanitarian|Speaker|Futurist|Visiting Professor|Corporate Director|Traveler,” was quite upfront about the fact that his numbers were only very rough estimates. The Sun, he said, exaggerated his claims considerably.  The “dossier,” Mr. MacLeod explained, wasn’t a leaked internal United Nations report. It was a two-page memo he had written for the British government long after he left the United Nations’ employ, plus the text of an email he had sent to people he hoped would support a new nonprofit he and some lawyer colleagues were founding to work on this issue. More important, the terrifying numbers the memo cited were just rough guesses intended to hint at the scale of the problem, not actual measurements. Take that estimate of 60,000 rapes, for instance. For one thing, it was actually an estimate of the number of victims of all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation, not just rape. To arrive at that figure, Mr. MacLeod said, he started with a 2017 report in which the United Nations said it had recorded 311 victims of sexual exploitation by peacekeepers in the previous year. He then made a series of assumptions that led him from 311 reported cases to his headline-grabbing claim of 60,000. But those assumptions were little more than guesses, and Mr. MacLeod freely admits he has no hard data to back them up. The first assumption was based on a remark by the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, that the problem of sexual abuse was probably worse on the civilian side of the organization than within the peacekeeping forces. Mr. MacLeod concluded that this meant there must be at least 312 victims of the non-peacekeeping staff — 311 plus 1 — but to keep his “estimate” conservative, he put the number at 289, to arrive at an even 600 for the year. Needless to say, that kind of rounded guess based on an offhand statement is unlikely to be reliable. From there, Mr. MacLeod estimated that only 10 percent of the assaults were actually recorded, a figure he said was based on reporting rates in the United Kingdom, to arrive at a figure of 6,000 victims annually. But because the United Nations doesn’t have good (or possibly any) data about the rate at which victims report assaults by its staff, there’s no way to know if that was the right multiplier to use. Then, to arrive at an estimate for the decade, Mr. MacLeod assumed that 2016 was a representative year, so he multiplied 6,000 by 10.  Presto: 311 becomes 60,000. In Mr. MacLeod’s telling, he always intended his memo to be an advocacy statement rather than what he called “peer-reviewed” statistical analysis — essentially a way to say “here is a problem that is very large and very bad” (my phrase), with digits instead of words.      The problem is, that isn’t how journalists use statistics, or how the public consumes them. Good journalists always try to check the provenance of the numbers we cite. But we aren’t trained statisticians, so we can’t necessarily perform independent checks of every figure experts provide to us. And sometimes numbers manage to enter the news ecosystem so quickly and pervasively that our fact checks can’t keep up. After the Parkland school shooting, for instance, you may have seen the viral statistic that America had experienced 18 school shootings already this calendar year. In fact, it turns out, that number was misleading. It came from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control organization, whose definition of “school shootings” is far broader than the common understanding of the term. It counts every time a person fires a gun in or near a school building as a “school shooting,” including a suicide in Michigan that took place outside a shuttered, empty school. That’s not to say, of course, that such events are not upsetting and tragic in their own right. But they are not what people imagine when they hear the term “school shooting.” So the statistic, without context, was misleading. The Washington Post eventually published a careful debunking of Everytown’s figures. But by that time, the number had already been tweeted by Senator Bernie Sanders and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, and cited by news organizations including MSNBC, the BBC, NBC News, ABC News and CBS News. That matters. Numbers, if trustworthy, are a way to make reporting more rigorous and objective, and to show that a story is based on cold hard facts rather than a handful of anecdotes. And when a number is big and splashy, like Mr. MacLeod’s 60,000 victims or Everytown’s 18 school shootings, it can make a point very powerfully. When people see a number in the paper or on a trusted news program, they tend to believe that it’s valid, especially if an expert is cited as the source. They don’t see an advocacy statement. They see rigor and objectivity, even if none actually exist. The result is that a number will often be taken much more seriously than an advocacy statement would be. That’s all the more true if the story gets picked up by other news outlets. Mr. MacLeod, who has appeared on television and given other print interviews, seems to be everywhere. And the more he gets quoted, the more authoritative he seems to be.  The first problem with that, of course, is that the public is now under the mistaken impression that a reliable whistle-blower investigation has concluded that the United Nations is harboring thousands of predators, when in fact it was just a back-of-the-envelope sketch of the size of the problem. It’s entirely possible that the number of victims is much, much higher. It also might be much lower. We just don’t know. But even more worrying is the way that bad information, like bad money, drives out good. “Those of us who work on this issue know that if we take one misstep, the men who abuse will use it against us to make sure nothing changes,” Sarah Martin, a consultant who wrote a 2005 report on sexual assault and exploitation by members of United Nations peacekeeping missions, said by email. Ms. Martin, who has advised the United Nations and other international aid organizations on gender-based violence, said she and her colleagues feared that Mr. MacLeod’s figures would provide exactly that kind of excuse, distracting from the less splashy but more reliable information that is already available. “I have heard so many horrific stories from women that I don’t need false statistics waved around,” Ms. Martin said. “It discredits the very brave women and children who struggle to come forward and then do — usually to disbelief and disinterest.” A version of this article appears in print on March 1, 2018, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Rape Statistic in U.N. Scandal Is Shocking, but It’s Just Guesswork.   Order Reprints|  Today's Paper|Subscribe

NYTNow,469," By KAREN ZRAICK and LANCE BOOTHFEB. 25, 2018 Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., have won praise for their strength and eloquence on the world stage. They’ve attended rallies, raised money, met the president and sparred with lawmakers. But when the cameras are off and the day’s rallies are over, the young survivors of the massacre struggle with the loss of their friends and educators, and the nightmares that flood back in moments of stillness. Above, a memorial outside the school. There was more horrifying news about how the attack unfolded. We got a transcript of a woman’s call to an F.B.I. tip line in January. “I know he’s going to explode,” she said of the suspect, Nikolas Cruz. A sheriff’s deputy who was on duty at the school when the attack began took cover outside, rather than trying to stop him. ____ 2. President Trump endorsed an N.R.A. plan to arm teachers who are adept with weaponry. He discussed the plan at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. Here’s a video.  Wayne LaPierre, above, the head of the N.R.A., also spoke at the conference, and offered a fierce defense of the Second Amendment in his first public remarks since the massacre.  Facing public pressure, a number of corporations, including MetLife Insurance, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and several car rental companies, announced plans to cut ties with the N.R.A. We looked at how the group derives its political influence: not through political donations, but by mobilizing its members. ____ 3. Rick Gates, above, once the deputy chairman for the Trump campaign, agreed to cooperate with the special counsel’s inquiry into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. He pleaded guilty to financial fraud and lying to investigators, and may be offering incriminating information about his longtime business associate, Paul Manafort, who served as chairman of the Trump campaign. Here’s a breakdown of the more than 100 charges filed in the inquiry so far. No one outside of the special counsel’s office knows for sure where it’s heading. But our White House correspondent writes that the flurry of recent action seems to be inexorably leading to a larger target. Separately, the House Intelligence Committee released a redacted Democratic memo rebutting Republican claims of surveillance abuses by the F.B.I. It had been blocked by President Trump two weeks ago. (You can read it here.) ____ 4. The Supreme Court will hear a case on Monday that could cripple public-sector unions. The legal question: Should state government employees in Illinois have to pay their union for representing them in collective bargaining?  Conservative groups say the First Amendment bars forcing government workers from having to pay anything, and the court has signaled that it agrees. Labor leaders like Randy Clover, above, say the case is an effort to diminish the protections that unions provide to their members. ____ 5. The U.N. Security Council voted on Saturday in favor of a 30-day cease-fire in Syria, after days of government bombardment on a besieged Damascus suburb, above, left hundreds of civilians dead. A pause in fighting would allow humanitarian aid to reach eastern Ghouta, and allow for the evacuation of civilians. Residents there are hiding in basements and makeshift bomb shelters amid a brutal aerial assault by the government. ____ 6. As climate change pushes seas higher, threatening coastal areas across the globe, nations are grappling with an existential question: Which communities should be protected, and which should be left to the tides? In a special report with NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune, we examined the struggles of south Louisiana, the epicenter of land loss in America. Above, the community of Jean Lafitte, where the question is not whether it will succumb to the sea. It’s when. For more coverage of climate change, sign up for our newsletter, Climate Fwd:. ____ 7. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada was ridiculed for his Bollywood-worthy outfits in India. (The trip was supposed to focus on trade, not fashion.) Above, Mr. Trudeau and his family at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Donald Trump Jr. was also in India, promoting luxury condos. His trip was dogged by controversy over the possibility of blurred lines between commerce and government. And Ivanka Trump is in South Korea, where she led the American delegation at the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics. Kim Yong-chol, the head of North Korea’s delegation, expressed willingness to speak with the U.S., according to the South Korean president’s office.  ____ 8.  Norway finished the Games with by far the most medals of any country: 39, 14 of them gold. It is the greatest performance in the history of the Winter Games. And it has left some Norwegians worrying whether they are winning too much. “We always want to win,” a Norwegian sports commentator explained. “But modesty is a big part of the culture here.” The U.S. has 23 medals, nine of them gold. And we are thrilled to report that one of them belongs to the men’s curling team, above, once known as “Team Reject,” which defeated top-ranked Sweden. Here’s the full medal count. ____ 9. “Black Panther” is breaking box office records. Our magazine writer called it a “defining moment for black America” in an essay that explores Wakanda’s emotional power and symbolism. Above, Chadwick Boseman, who plays the Panther. “The film arrives as a corporate product,” Carvell Wallace writes. “But we are using it for our own purposes, posting with unbridled ardor about what we’re going to wear to the opening night, announcing the depths of the squads we’ll be rolling with, declaring that Feb. 16, 2018, will be ‘the Blackest Day in History.’” ____ 10. Finally, did you keep up with the headlines this week? Test your knowledge with our news quiz. (And if you’d like to see today’s front page, it’s here.) A friendly reminder: It’s not all bad news out there. Here are some great things we wrote about this week, including a new, 10 million-acre national park system in Chile, above.

NYTNow,470," By KAREN ZRAICK and SANDRA STEVENSONFEB. 23, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “Despite my initial desire to vigorously defend myself, I have had a change of heart.” Rick Gates, the former deputy chairman of the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty to fraud and lying to investigators in the special counsel’s inquiry into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. He is cooperating with the inquiry, and may be offering incriminating information about Paul Manafort, his longtime associate and a former chairman of the Trump campaign. In a letter to friends and family, Mr. Gates, above, wrote that the cost and the “circuslike atmosphere” of an anticipated trial spurred him to make a deal. Read our 2017 profile of Mr. Gates here. ____ 2. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, above, President Trump announced harsh new shipping sanctions against North Korea.  It was a clear signal, near the end of an Olympic Games marked by a rapprochement between North and South Korea, that his pressure campaign against Pyongyang will not let up.  And Mr. Trump got big applause as he boasted about his decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Officials told us the administration planned to officially move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in May, to mark the 70th anniversary of the country’s founding. ____ 3. Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, above, defied the N.R.A. and proposed raising the age limit for any gun purchases to 21. The proposal, largely endorsed by House and Senate leaders, is the most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades. But it fell far short of what student advocates pleaded for after the Parkland school massacre. ____ 4. A woman who knew Nikolas Cruz, the school shooting suspect, told the F.B.I. last month that he had an arsenal and she worried he might be “getting into a school and just shooting the place up.” “I know he’s going to explode,” she said in a call to the agency’s tip hotline. We obtained a transcript. On “The Daily,” we grapple with a difficult question: How can the mental health system stop gun violence when mental illness is so rarely the cause of it? And we collected some of the best writing from across the political spectrum about gun control. Above, a protest in Washington this week.  ____ 5. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada was the subject of global ridicule for his Bollywood-worthy outfits during a weeklong trip to India. His elaborate dress was called “too Indian even for an Indian.” Above, Mr. Trudeau and his family with the movie star Shah Rukh Khan. Donald Trump Jr. was also in India this week, selling luxury condos for the Trump Organization. After days of controversy over the possibility of blurred lines between government and business, he abandoned plans to give a policy speech. And Ivanka Trump is in South Korea, where she will lead the American delegation at the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics on Sunday. ____ 6. In Syria, government-allied militias swept into the northwestern town of Afrin, above, in support of Kurdish forces. It’s a setback for Turkey, which is trying to clear the Kurdish groups from the area. And at the U.N. Security Council this week, Russia stalled plans for a cease-fire that would have allowed humanitarian aid to reach a besieged rebel-held enclave near Damascus. ____ 7. Anbang Insurance Group burst onto the global scene in 2014, when it announced a nearly $2 billion deal to purchase the famed Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York, above, an Art Deco symbol of Champagne-soaked excess. Few had ever heard of the company, which was founded a decade earlier in Ningbo, China, and skyrocketed to success selling insurance and wealth management products.  On Friday, it all came crashing down. The Chinese government seized Anbang, saying it broke regulations and jeopardized its ability to pay claims. Its former chairman, Wu Xiaohui, now faces criminal charges in a Shanghai court. Here’s the story of its fall. ____  8. At the Olympics, we look at the remarkable dietary habits of cross-country skiers, like Martin Moeller of Denmark, above. They eat more than any other type of athlete — by a lot. Men in the category need up to 8,000 calories a day. That’s more than three times the normal recommendation. The long-distance men and women’s skiing competitions will be held this weekend. The closing ceremony is on Sunday. Here’s the full medal count and schedule. ____ 9. How are you going to achieve anything if you can’t even do the splits? That’s the question Eiko, above center, asks in her new book, “Even the Stiffest People Can Do the Splits: A Four-Week Stretching Plan to Achieve Amazing Health.” The book is a smash hit in Japan, where Eiko says women in their 30s and 40s — and lots of senior citizens — are taking her tough-love message seriously. It was recently released in the U.S., and it left our author wondering if Eiko is the next Marie Kondo. ____ 10. Finally, Trevor Noah riffed on the CNN town hall event with survivors of the Florida school shooting. He was impressed that Senator Marco Rubio said he would reconsider his position on high-capacity magazines, which allow weapons to fire many bullets quickly. “I’m not going to lie, I’m surprised that these heckling teenagers got Rubio to change his mind,” Mr. Noah said.  “Maybe bullying isn’t that bad after all. In fact, maybe that’s how you get the rest of America’s lawmakers to do anything: Move the floor of Congress to the middle of a coliseum.” Have a great weekend. ____ Get a nightly rundown of the day’s top stories, delivered to your inbox every Monday through Friday.

In a presidential order, Mr. Trump said “there is credible evidence” that led him to believe Singapore-based Broadcom’s control of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.”  The extraordinary action by the president underscored the more forceful and protectionist action his administration has taken in recent weeks to protect American companies and ward off foreign investment in the United States. It followed an intervention this month by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which typically works behind closed doors and reviews deals only after they are announced, to stall the deal because of national security concerns.  From President Trump’s order: (a) There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Broadcom Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of Singapore (Broadcom), along with its partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates, including Broadcom Corporation, a California corporation, and Broadcom Cayman L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership, and their partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates (together, the Purchaser), through exercising control of Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm), a Delaware corporation, might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; and (b) Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect the national security in this matter. Further down (e) The Purchaser and Qualcomm shall immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover. Immediately upon completion of all steps necessary to terminate the proposed takeover of Qualcomm, the Purchaser and Qualcomm shall certify in writing to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that such termination has been effected in accordance with this order and that all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed takeover of Qualcomm have been completed. Most C.E.O.s have to go to work each day and grind out better margins in highly competitive businesses that taxpayers won’t bail out if they blow up. This is now the fate that awaits the next C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs. In apparently priming David M. Solomon for the job, Goldman seems to be signaling that, even if trading revenue revives after some difficult quarters, it intends to press on with its efforts to bolster its nontrading businesses, like lending to corporations and consumers. Mr. Solomon, after a successful run as the head of Goldman’s powerful deal-making business, embodies in many ways the bank’s hopes to be far more than a high-octane trading shop. Of course, if the Trump administration guts Wall Street regulations, particularly the Volcker Rule, Goldman may be tempted to pile back into trading. But the bank’s recent track record in trading suggests that would not be a good idea. Not only does Goldman’s business that trades bonds, derivatives, currencies and commodities bounce around too much for shareholders’ tastes, it is opaque. Bank executives are often loath to talk in detail when it underperforms. Goldman also made strategic mistakes in this business in recent years. It focused too heavily on hedge fund clients, something it is trying to fix by reaching out to different types of customers. Its commodities business, which it clung to in the face of political pressure, has been a drawn out disappointment. And Wall Street traders ought not to get too excited about the prospects of deregulation. As some rules get loosened, others may get toughened up, like those that would liquidate a troubled Wall Street firm rather than bail it out. While the government may not be winding down any large banks anytime soon, the diminished likelihood of bailouts can force up the cost of borrowing for firms like Goldman. This, in turn, may steer them away from riskier businesses like trading. Investors still seem to doubt Goldman’s desire to adapt to a much more ordinary future. This is revealed in a comparison of Goldman and its rival, Morgan Stanley.  Goldman’s return on shareholder equity, a closely watched metric that quantifies the profits generated on shareholders’ money, has been higher than that of Morgan Stanley in recent years. But investors seem just as enthusiastic about the future of Morgan Stanley. Its stock trades at the same multiple to shareholders equity as Goldman’s. Why? Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading to businesses, like wealth management, that are more stable. — Peter Eavis David M. Solomon is Goldman Sachs’s heir apparent. The Wall Street firm said Mr. Solomon would serve as its sole president and chief operating officer, setting him up as the potential successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein, the investment bank’s longtime chief executive. Context Mr. Solomon and Harvey M. Schwartz were seen as the favorites to eventually replace Mr. Blankfein when they were named co-chief operating officers and presidents in December 2016. But, Mr. Schwartz, who previously served as the bank’s chief financial officer and global co-head of the securities division, has decided to retire in April, Goldman said on Monday. “Harvey has been a mentor to many, and his influence has made an indelible impact on generations of professionals at Goldman Sachs,” Mr. Blankfein said in a news release. “I want to thank Harvey for all he’s done for the firm.” Mr. Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and previously served as co-head of its investment banking division. — Chad Bray Critic’s corner Anthony Currie of Breakingviews writes: “If Solomon does take the reins, it would end some 12 years of traders holding top positions at the Wall Street firm – and serve as another sign of Goldman’s troubles in that business.” Case in point: • Trading accounted for 53 percent of Goldman’s revenue in 2012. • It made just over a third of the firm’s revenue last year.  “Meanwhile, takings from merger advisory and stock-and-bond underwriting – Solomon’s world – increased by half over the past six years. So positioning him as likely heir would look like a way of rewarding past success.” Goldman’s reputation for advising companies in mergers and acquisitions is well earned. Most years, it tops the rankings of advisers by deal volume known as the league tables. So it was a bit surprising to see Goldman currently ranked fifth on both the global and the United States league tables. Here’s a look: Global  Morgan Stanley: $228.88 billion JPMorgan: $198.82 billion Bank of America Merrill Lynch: $138.76 billion Lazard: $134.39 billion Goldman Sachs: $131.56 billion United States Morgan Stanley: $132.36 billion Lazard: $119.69 billion JPMorgan: $114.37 billion Centerview: $112.75 billion Goldman Sachs: $102.54 billion Two points to note: 1) It is still early in the year and one big deal can reshuffle the rankings; 2) The value of transactions Goldman has advised on this year is up 31 percent from the same period a year ago. Larry Kudlow emerged Monday as the latest favorite in a changing rotation of potential replacements for Gary D. Cohn as the head the National Economic Council. The job has not been formally offered to Mr. Kudlow, but the CNBC television commentator, who has informally advised President Trump on economic issues, is likely to interview him in the coming days. Context From the NYT’s Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley:  Heading into the weekend, the top contender to replace Mr. Cohn was Christopher Liddell, who is a special assistant to the president working with the Office of American Innovation on a team led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Liddell’s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point. But after The New York Times reported that Mr. Liddell was under consideration, Mr. Trump received pushback from people both inside and outside the White House, according to the people close to the president. On Monday, The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board wrote a piece critical of Mr. Liddell’s views on free trade. On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said. In a revised prospectus filed this morning, the online storage company said that it planned to sell 36 million shares at $16 to $18 a share. At the midpoint of that range, Dropbox would be valued at about $7.5 billion, compared to the $10 billion of its most recent private fund-raising.  The big thought: The Dropbox offering — along with that of Spotify — could show how interested Wall Street investors are in the latest batch of Silicon Valley “unicorns,” or privately held companies worth at least $1 billion. The man who made Dropbox: Meet Drew Houston, who created a multibillion-dollar business because he forgot to bring a USB flash drive one day while a student at M.I.T. His holdings could be worth nearly $1.7 billion The market for initial public offerings is on a tear, and, going by Dropbox’s latest financial filing, it may be getting a little overheated. Dropbox, a company that stores files on remote computers for consumers and businesses, on Monday said it aims to price its shares at between $16 and $18. The midpoint of those two prices would value Dropbox at around $6.8 billion, excluding some shares that may be awarded to executives in the future. That’s a lot, though about 30 percent below the $10 billion valuation it received after its fundraising round in 2014. At $6.8 billion, Dropbox would be trading at just over six times the $1.1 billion in sales it had for 2017. Companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index trade at 2.3 times sales. Dropbox would also have a higher valuation than Box, another file storage company, whose market value is 5.6 times the revenue it generated in its last fiscal year, which ended in January. Investors may, however, decide that Dropbox’s higher valuation is not justified. True, its sales grew at an impressive 31 percent last year, but that is not materially faster than the 27 percent Box achieved in its latest fiscal year. (Revenue grew 6.3 percent at companies in the S.&P. 500, according to FactSet.)  Neither company made a profit in their most recent fiscal year. Both are generating positive cash flows, though. And at $330 million last year, Dropbox’s cash flows were more than five times those of Box’s $62 million. If Dropbox went public at the $6.8 billion implied in Monday’s filing, it would trade at 21 times its 2017 cash flows. That is pricey, but that is less than half of Box’s cash flow multiple. — Peter Eavis Speculation has long swirled that Apple should buy Netflix. On Monday, the iPhone maker agreed to buy Texture, the “Netflix of magazines.” Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.     The digital magazine app offers users a $10 a month subscription to read more than 200 magazines, including People, the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Vogue. The deal is part of Apple’s effort to bolster its services businesses. The WSJ reports: Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020. The company generated nearly $30 billion in services revenue in its fiscal year ended in September. The Texture transaction follows Apple’s deal for Shazam, the music recognition app, in December. Texture is owned by Next Issue Media, a joint-venture between Condé Nast, Hearst, Meredith, News Corp, Rogers Media and K.K.R. Apple did not disclose the price. Shares of the video streaming company are down 3.4 percent Monday to about $320 after the short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research tweeted that he thinks the stock can be ”shorted back to $300.”

From the outside, the Saudi businessmen (including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal) who were corralled into Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton — in what Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described as an anticorruption campaign — seemed to be in a gilded cage. The reality was far more disturbing. Many were physically abused and one captive was killed, witnesses told the NYT. The Saudi government extracted billions of dollars of assets from detainees to set them free. More from Ben Hubbard, David Kirkpatrick, Kate Kelly and Mark Mazzetti of the NYT: One former detainee, forced to wear a tracking device, has sunk into depression as his business collapses. “We signed away everything,” a relative of his said. “Even the house I am in, I am not sure if it is still mine.” The net effect: Many outside investors, whom Saudi officials have hoped to woo to help transform the kingdom’s economy, are now rattled by what they say was a lack of transparency.  Of note: The roles of the accounting company PWC and the law firm Clifford Chance in the Saudi government’s takeover of MBC, a broadcaster. Elsewhere in the kingdom: Aramco is more likely to go public next year than late this year as originally expected, Michael reported yesterday. Among the issues is that much of the work in pulling off the biggest I.P.O. in history has yet to be finished. Students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School took out a full-page ad in the NYT over the weekend to thank businesses “who acted on their consciences and took positive steps for change” after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Among the companies thanked: BlackRock, Bumble, Delta, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Gucci, Kroger, REI and Walmart. The students are looking for GoFundMe donations for their March For Our Lives on March 24 in Washington. Lots of big businesses weren’t mentioned. Let us know if your company is changing its policies or donating to the march. History hasn’t been kind to those who seek victory in trade conflicts, though it remains unclear whether President Trump’s tariffs will play out the same way. Farmers in the Midwest are fearful of a tit-for-tat response that could lose them customers. And investors are watching to see whether a full-blown global trade conflict will erupt. The politics flyaround  • Mr. Trump’s unpredictability has helped cast China as  a more stable superpower. And changes to the Chinese Constitution that allow President Xi Jinping to govern indefinitely could usher him into a global club of autocrats alongside leaders like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and Vladimir Putin of Russia.  • Business are scrambling to address errors and ambiguities in the U.S. tax overhaul. (NYT) • Chris Liddell, a White House official and a former executive at Microsoft and G.M., is a front-runner to succeed Gary Cohn as the administration’s top economic adviser.

(Bloomberg) By the time he was essentially forced out of the ride-hailing giant, Mr. Kalanick had annoyed many onetime allies among the company’s senior executives and outside investors, according to Business Insider. Among them: Salle Yoo, Uber’s longtime top lawyer, and Rachel Whetstone, the company’s communications head, who have both since left the company. And then there was Bill Gurley of the investment firm Benchmark. According to the article: As Gurley pondered his options, he received an email that kicked him in the gut. It was from Katrina Lake, C.E.O. of the apparel-shopping service Stitch Fix, one of Benchmark’s other highly successful portfolio companies. Lake lambasted Gurley for not doing enough to fix Uber. She accused him of shirking his responsibility to make Silicon Valley a better place. Elsewhere in Uber: How the company can still create its own reality distortion field for investors. How it plans to expand Uber Eats. Oh, and its brand chief, Bozoma St. John, has quietly been driving for Uber Pool. The virtual currency corner:  Bitcoin is at $9,882.73. Some investors are using the virtual currency as an indicator of when the stock market will drop. Some exchanges are reportedly charging up to $1 million for the listing of initial coin offerings on their platforms. And scammers made off with more than $2 million in digital money with a fake I.C.O.  The tech flyaround  • SoftBank is bringing together its Vision Fund and Fortress Investment to create an investing powerhouse. (NYT) • Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, says internet giants need to be regulated. (Axios) • Senator Mark Warner, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, says he is worried about the security of internet-connected devices. (CNBC) • Some former employees of Google say the company is going too far in its diversity efforts — others say it’s not going far enough. (NYT) Employees in restaurants and bars face a daily struggle to balance abuse from customers with the need to earn tips, according to dozens of servers who spoke with the NYT. Workers’ advocates are pushing a dozen states and the District of Columbia to change laws allowing restaurants to pay less than the minimum wage, which makes earning tips a necessity. Please tell us your experiences with tipping, too. The misconduct flyaround • The U2 frontman Bono apologized after a charity he helped found was accused of fostering an atmosphere of bullying, abuse and, in one case, attempted sexual coercion in its Johannesburg operation. (NYT) • Read the harassment policies of venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz, DFJ and Spark Capital, some of which promise to fire employees who violate the rules (even if that hasn’t always happened).

NYTNow,472," By CHRIS STANFORDFEB. 22, 2018  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Those were the words of the father of a student killed last week at a Florida high school as he pressed President Trump to act. “It should have been one school shooting, and we should have fixed it,” he added during a White House visit on Wednesday. Andrew Pollack, who lost his daughter in the Florida shooting, was a guest at a listening session at the White House. Mr. Trump said that arming educators could be a solution to gun violence. Here are 11   dramatic exchanges about gun control on Wednesday. In Florida, Senator Marco Rubio and a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association were repeatedly booed during a nationally televised forum at which they refused to back new gun control measures. And student protesters at the Florida Capitol confronted lawmakers, who responded that gun-related legislation could be introduced by Friday.  • Polls show strong  support for action on gun control and immigration. That sentiment is not, however, shared by the Republicans who control the government, our chief Washington correspondent says. • Border Patrol officers are working on private property and setting up checkpoints up to 100 miles from the frontier, part of an aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration.  The government isn’t required to obtain a warrant before searching people or property at ports of entry. Within what the Justice Department has defined as a “reasonable distance,” officers can search people suspected of violating immigration law or smuggling drugs. • But many residents and travelers say that authority amounts to an invasion of privacy. • When Kim Jong-un’s sister attended the Winter Olympics two weeks ago, the South Korean news media called her “North Korea’s Ivanka.” They’re about to get the real one. Ivanka Trump will attend the closing ceremony at the Games this weekend, a visit that administration officials say could smooth some of the tensions from Vice President Mike Pence’s trip. • For its part, North Korea announced today that it would send a high-level delegation, another sign that the two Koreas are trying to improve ties. • The Rev. Billy Graham was America’s best-known Christian evangelist for more than 60 years, using satellites to transmit sermons worldwide. He died Wednesday at 99. A counselor to presidents, Mr. Graham at times filled the role of national clergyman, offering prayers after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and preaching in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.  Our video explains how Mr. Graham capitalized on modern communication technologies to give his ministry a global reach. • He will lie in repose Monday and Tuesday in Charlotte, N.C., and his funeral will be on March 2. Over the course of his career, the Rev. Billy Graham capitalized on modern communication technologies — from television to satellite to the internet — to give his ministry a global reach. • The European Union has bestowed huge sums on Poland, but the country’s nationalist government has repeatedly bitten the hand that feeds it, with Warsaw accused of undermining democratic values. Poland will define whether the union’s long effort to integrate the former Soviet bloc succeeds or fails, and the stakes for Europe, many believe, far outweigh those of Britain’s exit. • Speaking of Brexit, Britain’s government suggested on Wednesday that the transition period could be longer than two years, a time frame that disappointed hard-line supporters of withdrawal. Demands for gun restrictions have followed one mass shooting after another, but little has changed. This time, the students who survived are leading the charge. • The U.S. economy is ready for higher interest rates, officials at the Federal Reserve say. • Ford Motor ousted the head of its North American operations over what it called “inappropriate behavior.” • Conversational A.I. systems can be improved by letting them talk to people online, researchers say. But people can be a bad influence. • Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant, has a shot at becoming the third great consumer computing platform of the decade, our tech columnist writes. • U.S. stocks were down on Wednesday.

It’s easy to spot members of the Dutch delegation at the Winter Olympics because they travel on orange bicycles, 132 of which were shipped to South Korea. The bikes are helping athletes feel at home. In the Netherlands, bicycles outnumber people, 22.5 million to 18 million. But the Netherlands wasn’t always a cyclist’s haven. In the 1950s and ’60s, as people started buying more cars, two-wheelers started to be pushed off the road. Literally. Bicycle deaths, like traffic deaths as a whole, increased. In 1971, about 3,300 people died in traffic accidents, including 400 children. Activist groups sprang up. Stop de Kindermoord (Stop the Child Murder) was among the most prominent.  The number of traffic deaths has dropped since then. In 2016, the Netherlands saw 629 traffic deaths, about a third of which were bike deaths. Twelve were children. Part of the success story: the country’s bike lanes, a network measuring about 22,000 miles.

NYTNow,473," By KAREN ZRAICK and SANDRA STEVENSONFEB. 22, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The head of the N.R.A., Wayne LaPierre, above, offered a fierce defense of the Second Amendment in his first public remarks since the massacre in Parkland, Fla. He warned against a socialist plot to “eradicate all individual freedoms” at a Conservative Political Action Conference gathering in Maryland. President Trump endorsed arming teachers to protect students from school shootings. He said that teachers who were qualified to handle a weapon would get a bonus, and that he would devote federal money to training them. And footage showed that an armed guard at Stoneman Douglas remained outside the building for “upwards of four minutes” during last week’s shooting. We discussed the gun control debate on “The Daily.” ____ 2. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, unsealed new charges against President Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, above.  Mr. Manafort is accused of hiding income and defrauding banks, and his longtime business associate and campaign deputy, Rick Gates, faces similar charges. Both men were indicted on similar charges in October.  The charges do not involve Mr. Trump, but the case paints an unflattering portrait of the man who ran his campaign. ____ 3. Donald Trump Jr. has spent the week in India, pitching new luxury high-rises that bear his family’s name. Controversy over the trip’s potential to blur the lines between commerce and government grew after reports that Mr. Trump plans to give a speech in New Delhi on Friday, at an event where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also speak. The topic? “Reshaping Indo-Pacific Ties: The New Era of Cooperation.” ____ 4. He’s not the only Trump child traveling this week. When Kim Jong-un’s sister attended the Winter Olympics two weeks ago, the South Korean news media called her “North Korea’s Ivanka.” Now, they’re about to get the real one. Ms. Trump will attend the closing ceremony at the Games on Sunday, and the U.S. is batting back rumors of another attempt at a meeting with North Korea. Leading North Korea’s high-level delegation to the closing ceremony is a former spymaster, Kim Yong-chol.  ____ 5. The White House has decided that it needs no new legal authority from Congress to indefinitely keep American military forces in Syria and Iraq. Officials say that the continued potential threat from the Islamic State provided a legal rationale to keep troops deployed. It’s been a brutal week in Syria, where the government is carrying out an aerial assault on a rebel-held enclave near Damascus, above. We collected footage that shows the despair of civilians trying to survive in basements. ____ 6. “All I know is that I don’t want people dying in front of my door.” We set out in the snow with a pizza chef in the French Alps who rescues migrants trying to hike through the mountains. Many of them have never even seen snow before, and they underestimate the toll the cold can take. But the work is risky: Helping anybody enter or travel in France without valid paperwork is technically illegal. ____ 7. Russian meddling in the Academy Awards sounds like a bad joke, but there are suspicious social media campaigns against two documentaries that the Kremlin is not fond of. One is “Last Men in Aleppo,” by Feras Fayyad, above, who spent nearly two years with the Syrian volunteer emergency medical workers known as the White Helmets. Russian media reports accuse him of making propaganda on behalf of both the West and Al Qaeda. The other is “Icarus,” about Russia’s doping program for athletes, by Bryan Fogel. The main subject of the film is Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia’s antidoping lab, who is in hiding in the U.S.  ____ 8. We got exclusive audio of “Monster,” a new song from Disney’s stage adaptation of “Frozen.” Hear it for yourself, as sung by Caissie Levy, above, the actress playing Elsa on Broadway. It was written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, the couple who wrote the ubiquitous power ballad “Let It Go.” We talked to them about the new song. ____ 9. A cultural note as the Olympic Games near their end: “Arirang,” a centuries-old Korean folk song, is often heard at the Games — and has served as a stand-in national anthem as North and South Korea build ties. Above, Yura Min and Alexander Gamelin skating for South Korea. Here’s the full medal count and the remaining schedule. Our preview of the coming women’s figure skating competition is here, and our full coverage of the Games is here. The Paralympics begin March 9. ____ 10. Finally, when David Chang tells you to go eat something, you listen. Our reporter at the Olympics got tips on the local cuisine from Mr. Chang, the famed Korean-American chef. (“Go eat the snow crab!” he said.) Above, freshly killed raw octopus. It was easy to get a table — most visitors are staying inside the Olympic bubble, and queuing up outside McDonald’s. That allowed our reporter to embark on his “food marathon” at his own pace. He chose a quick one. “Eating here this month has been like binge-watching IMAX movies I’d only seen on airplanes,” he reported.

Washington,474," By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS and KIRK SEMPLEFEB. 25, 2018 WASHINGTON — President Trump’s refusal to publicly drop his demand that Mexico pay for a wall on its border with the United States has derailed tentative plans for President Enrique Peña Nieto to make his first visit to the Trump White House next month, after a contentious telephone call last week reinflamed tensions on the issue, American and Mexican officials said. The two presidents agreed to scrap the trip after what had been planned as a diplomatic phone call to lay the groundwork for a meeting devolved into a bitter quarrel over the wall, a signature campaign promise of Mr. Trump’s that has long outraged Mr. Peña Nieto, who has said Mexico has no intention of paying for it. The episode, reported earlier by The Washington Post, is the latest instance of Mr. Trump clashing sharply with the leader of a longtime ally, and of his penchant for eschewing diplomatic niceties in favor of hard-edge confrontation. It also demonstrates the degree to which the wall has come to be a major sticking point between the two neighbors, fraying decades of friendly relations and potentially blocking progress on other vital issues. In the call, Mr. Trump balked at Mr. Peña Nieto’s attempts to secure a commitment that he would concede publicly during his visit to Washington that Mexico would not pay for the border wall, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe a confidential conversation.  Mr. Trump grew exasperated, one official said, when Mr. Peña Nieto did not drop the matter and move on to other issues.  The blowup left officials on both sides deeply disappointed that months of constructive negotiations laying the groundwork for a meeting between the presidents and rebuilding trust between the governments had been scuttled in one phone conversation. The presidents were hoping to use Mr. Peña Nieto’s visit to Washington to sign a number of bilateral treaties covering the drug fight, border issues and other matters, and to discuss trade, including the status of their efforts to renegotiate Nafta, the officials said. By Sunday, both governments were eager to put the best possible face on the squabble, insisting that a meeting was still possible and that relations had not suffered an irreparable blow. “We enjoy a great relationship with Mexico, and the two administrations have been working for a year to deepen our cooperation across a range of issues including security, immigration, trade and economics,” Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in a statement. After the call, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, spoke with Mr. Peña Nieto, and the two agreed they should keep working on areas of agreement, another administration official said. Both sides said a possible meeting between the two presidents remained on the table, though not on the timeline or in the style that had been planned. The confrontation, according to a Mexican official, chilled the warmth and good will that had been built up between the two sides over months of negotiations, and sapped whatever level of trust had been developed after a difficult start to the relationship. It was not the first time that a disagreement over the wall spoiled the chance for the two presidents to establish a rapport.  In another testy call shortly after Mr. Trump was inaugurated last year, the president pressed Mr. Peña Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for the wall, saying that would be a precondition for future talks.      “If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that,” Mr. Trump said, according to a transcript of that call obtained by The Post and posted online last summer. Mr. Peña Nieto told Mr. Trump during that call that the notion of Mexico paying for the wall was “completely unacceptable for Mexicans,” saying it would also be politically toxic for him to ever accept it. But Mr. Trump told Mr. Peña Nieto that he regarded his vow that Mexico would pay for the wall as a political imperative that he dared not relinquish. The issue derailed the first attempt by the American and Mexican governments to coordinate a meeting between the two presidents. During a January 2017 visit to Washington by Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray to arrange an announced visit, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to complain that Mexico seemed unwilling to pay for the border wall. Mr. Videgaray suspended all of his meetings and returned home. It was clear to Mexican officials then that there would be no benefit to Mr. Peña Nieto in meeting with Mr. Trump. The collapse of the new, tentatively scheduled March visit was similarly abrupt. When Mr. Videgaray returned from a visit to Washington 10 days ago, he seemed pleased with his progress. The Mexican Foreign Ministry published a picture of Mr. Videgaray at a working lunch with Mr. Kushner; Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser; and various members of the cabinet, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Tucked into the account of the foreign minister’s trip was news that came as a surprise to Mexicans: The two sides had agreed to begin planning a meeting between Mr. Peña Nieto and Mr. Trump. The idea was met with astonishment in Mexico, where Mr. Trump is widely despised for his stream of insults against Mexican immigrants and his insistence on building a wall and sticking Mexico with the bill. A cartoon last Sunday in the newspaper Reforma asked incredulously why the trip was planned, noting that Mr. Trump had not changed any of his policies, and depicted Mr. Trump smashing a pie into Mr. Peña Nieto’s face. Before the phone conversation, the two sides had agreed — at the behest of Mr. Trump’s team — that the presidents should avoid talking about the thorny issues that had scuttled their first planned meeting, the Mexican official said, and Trump administration officials told their Mexican counterparts that they would ensure that the president would not dwell on past disagreements. But during the call, the official said, Mr. Trump lost his temper. A White House official said Mr. Trump had simply become frustrated at Mr. Peña Nieto’s insistence on staying on the subject of the wall.  The Mexican government has more than the damage to Mr. Peña Nieto’s reputation to worry about. His handpicked candidate to succeed him, former Finance Minister José Antonio Meade, is running in third place in the July 1 presidential election. A botched meeting between the two presidents could ricochet and hurt Mr. Meade’s struggling campaign. The White House and the Mexican government issued separate short statements on Tuesday noting that the two presidents had spoken by phone to exchange condolences over the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., and a helicopter crash in Oaxaca, Mexico. The Mexican statement said the governments would continue their bilateral agenda “through the coordinated efforts of their teams.” Mr. Peña Nieto’s spokesman, Eduardo Sánchez, said Saturday night that the Mexican government had nothing else to add to that statement. The White House said Mr. Trump had “underscored his commitment to expanding cooperation between the United States and Mexico on security, trade and immigration.” Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Washington, and Kirk Semple from Mexico City. Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting from Mexico City.

Washington,475," By ALI WATKINSFEB. 22, 2018 WASHINGTON — For years, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has been overlooked in Washington. Overshadowed by more politically powerful law enforcement agencies like the F.B.I., the A.T.F. garnered headlines mostly for notorious episodes, including the deadly 1993 siege in Waco, Tex., and the “Fast and Furious” gunwalking scandal more than a decade later. Now, the A.T.F. is on the verge of a crisis. The agency, which has not grown significantly since its founding in 1973, is about to confront a staffing shortage and is set to lose its tobacco and alcohol enforcement authorities. President Trump has yet to nominate a director to oversee the agency, which has been without permanent leadership for eight of the past 12 years. Amid the dearth of leadership and resources, the White House is pushing the A.T.F. to the forefront of its fight against violent crime. In response to the mass shooting at a Florida high school last week, Mr. Trump, who promised to fight violent criminal gangs and illegal guns — two of the A.T.F.’s key missions — announced that he would be relying on the bureau to regulate so-called bump stock accessories. But it is all but politically impossible for Mr. Trump, who counts the powerful gun lobby among his most ardent supporters, to strengthen the A.T.F. The National Rifle Association has long sought to hobble the agency in an effort to curb its ability to regulate guns, which the gun lobby has traditionally opposed.  “Most people in law enforcement know why A.T.F. can’t get a director,” said Michael Bouchard, a former agent and the president of the A.T.F. Association, an independent group that supports current and former bureau officials. “It’s not because of the people. It’s because of the politics.”  For decades, the N.R.A. has used its sway in Washington to preserve the A.T.F. in its limited capacity. It has aggressively lobbied against nominated directors and pushed Congress to enact restrictions on how the bureau spends money to curtail its ability to regulate firearms and track gun crimes. One funding provision, for example, forbids the A.T.F. from using electronic databases to trace guns to owners. Instead, the agency relies on a warehouse full of paper records. It is beneficial to the N.R.A. to have a smaller agency like the A.T.F. in charge of gun regulation, one senior bureau official acknowledged, rather than a larger, more politically powerful agency like the F.B.I. that can more effectively demand additional resources from Capitol Hill. The gun lobby is one of the most potent political forces in Washington, doling out tens of millions of dollars each election cycle to lawmakers and campaigns to steer the political discourse on gun regulation. The N.R.A. reported spending the most amount of money in its history in 2016 working to support Mr. Trump and the Republican Party, and its backing has come under renewed scrutiny in the gun debate that has taken shape in the days since the shooting in Parkland, Fla. The president, in turn, has courted gun advocates, vowing to defend firearm owners and the N.R.A. In a tweet on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump called the organization “Great People and Great American Patriots.” 
            What many people don’t understand, or don’t want to understand, is that Wayne, Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots. They love our Country and will do the right thing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!         The A.T.F. rose to prominence in the Prohibition era with its takedown of Al Capone. In the decades since, its mission has been tailored toward gun violence and trafficking. More recently, the bureau has had its share of troubling episodes. It was infamously involved in the 1993 siege at a Branch Davidian compound in Texas in which 75 peopled were killed, and during the “Fast and Furious” scandal two decades later, the bureau lost guns across the Mexican border, which were later recovered at crime scenes. Agents also used a multimillion-dollar slush fund meant to pay informants to instead pad their own pockets, The New York Times revealed last year. Under President Barack Obama, the White House considered eliminating the A.T.F. The proposal, a direct affront to the N.R.A., would have transferred all its law enforcement authorities to the F.B.I., a former senior Obama administration official said. The plan was largely abandoned, however, after the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn. The N.R.A. opposed the nomination of Andrew Travers, whom Mr. Obama selected to lead the agency in 2010. Mr. Travers was never confirmed. The N.R.A. did not take a position on the agency’s last and only director confirmed by the Senate, B. Todd Jones, who led the A.T.F. from 2011 to 2015.  “We support enforcement of the laws on the books and A.T.F. efforts to apprehend and prosecute violent criminals,” said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the N.R.A. “We have and will continue to oppose political appointees looking to enact an anti-gun agenda through the regulatory process making it more difficult for law abiding citizens to exercise their constitutional rights while criminals continue to break the law.”      An official at the Justice Department said the administration was interviewing potential A.T.F. directors but did not know when that might result in a nomination. The White House has confidence in the acting director, Thomas E. Brandon, the official said, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Mr. Brandon, who has served in that capacity since 2015, is thought of highly among the A.T.F. work force, agents said. But even his most ardent supporters acknowledge that a Senate-confirmed director, handpicked by the president, would be better positioned to be an advocate for the agency. There is no indication that Mr. Brandon will be nominated to permanently lead the bureau. “A.T.F. works diligently with the resources that we have,” said a bureau spokesman, Joshua Jackson. “And like any agency, we could always use additional resources.” The A.T.F.’s own 52-page budget proposal for the current fiscal year describes an agency on the cusp of a resource crisis. That document is separate from the White House budget proposed last week, which lays out the administration’s broader priorities for the fiscal year that begins in October. In describing its own shortages, the A.T.F. says it remains unable to fulfill even basic regulatory responsibilities, including inspections of firearms dealers — something the bureau says presents a “significant risk to public safety.” The A.T.F. is also bracing for the departure of nearly a fifth of its roughly 2,500 special agents. Of them, 499 are at least 50 years old, according to the budget proposal, and face mandatory retirement at 57. Last year, 141 agents retired from the A.T.F., Mr. Jackson said, and only 117 were hired. An additional 24 agents left the bureau for other reasons. Still, as ranks thin, the A.T.F. is being tasked to lead some of the Trump administration’s most lauded violent crime initiatives. A team of agents was sent to Chicago over the summer to help the city combat gun violence, and the bureau is leading crackdowns on the MS-13 criminal gang, which Mr. Trump has vowed to “eradicate.” Matt Apuzzo and Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting. Kitty Bennett contributed research. A version of this article appears in print on February 23, 2018, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: How the N.R.A.

NYTNow,476," By KAREN ZRAICK and LISA IABONIFEB. 20, 2018 (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Students who survived the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., are headed to the state capital to push for gun control. It’s a seven-hour ride, and our reporter is tweeting from the bus. “This shooting is different from the other ones,” one student told her. “I just have a gut feeling — something is going to change.” Other students were already in Tallahassee, where the Florida House rejected a motion to take up a bill to ban assault rifles. We reported that just an hour after news of the shooting broke, Twitter accounts suspected of links to Russia were using it to inflame the gun control debate. They used hashtags like #NRA and #ar15, and posted messages both for and against gun restrictions. ____  2. President Trump ordered the Justice Department to propose regulations to ban so-called bump stocks, which can convert a semiautomatic gun into an automatic weapon.  He made the announcement at the White House as he conferred the medal of valor on public safety officials, above.  And he continued to deflect blame for the Russian election interference detailed in U.S. indictments last week, suggesting that President Barack Obama was dismissive of the threat. There was another, smaller-scale indictment: A lawyer for a former Trump campaign aide pleaded guilty to lying to the special counsel. ____ 3. Nearly a dozen special elections are being held around the U.S. this year to fill seats suddenly left open by the #MeToo reckoning. Above, a rally in Las Vegas last month. Yet the candidates — many of them women — running to replace these disgraced men are hesitating to put the issue of sexual harassment front and center in their campaigns. We went out on the campaign trail to hear why. One said voters shrug it off: “‘Oh well, another one bites the dust, let’s move on, tell me what you’re interested in.’” ____ 4. The Syrian government, with its Russian and Iranian allies, is fighting to regain control of western Syria, whatever the cost. Violence that has been rising over weeks has intensified. Syrian and Russian planes struck a rebel-held enclave of some 400,000 people near Damascus, above, in one of the worst bombardments in years. Nearly 100 people were reported killed.  And Turkish jets and artillery attacked pro-government militias for a second day, keeping them from reaching the northwestern city of Afrin to reinforce Kurdish militias. ____ 5. The mushrooming corruption scandal plaguing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, above, took a surprising new turn. One of his closest advisers was accused of trying to bribe a judge to drop a criminal investigation involving Mr. Netanyahu’s wife. The police arrested several of Mr. Netanyahu’s friends and confidants, and top executives of the country’s biggest telecommunications company. Mr. Netanyahu released a video calling the accusations against him “hallucinatory” and “baseless” and part of a “campaign of persecution” that had been “going on for years.” ____ 6. American officials have rebuffed requests from Mexico to help investigate the use of government spying technology against innocent civilians. There’s concern that Mexico wants to use the U.S. as a cover in a sham inquiry, American officials told us. Above center, President Enrique Peña Nieto. We broke the story last year that the Mexican government had been using the technology to spy on prominent human rights lawyers, academics and journalists. Our Mexico bureau chief and technology writer explained how they got the scoop. ____ 7. Anyone who has ever been on a diet knows that the standard prescription for weight loss is to reduce calorie intake. But a new study may turn that advice on its head.  It found that people who cut back on sugar, refined grains and processed foods, and ate more vegetables and whole foods — without worrying about portion sizes — lost significant amounts of weight over the course of a year. Above, a very healthy meal of quinoa and vegetables. A health expert we talked to said the study showed a “road map to reducing the obesity epidemic” by focusing on food quality, not calorie-counting. ____ 8. Winners of gold, and more than gold. The unified Korean women’s hockey team closed out its Olympic run without a single win. For many, that was hardly the point. Our photographer Chang Lee, whose own life has been shaped by the division in Korea, cried as he shot the opening ceremony. Check out his images of the Games. On Tuesday night’s broadcast, Lindsey Vonn will vie for her second Olympic gold in the women’s downhill. Our interactive graphic shows the price her body has paid for her quest. Here’s our full coverage, plus the medals table, results and schedule. ____ 9. The countdown to the Oscars has begun. The ceremony will be held on March 4. We talked to Yance Ford, above, the first transgender director to receive an Oscar nomination, for his documentary “Strong Island.” The film is a brutal, intimate portrait of the unraveling of his tight-knit family following the death of his brother, William Ford Jr., in Suffolk County in 1992, and an all-white grand jury’s decision not to indict the white man who shot him. “If my nomination helps people at all think about the transgender folks in their lives, in their communities, and treating them as humans and equals deserving of protection, I’m happy,” he said. ____ 10. Finally, a vast swath of Patagonia — home to pumas, condors, flamingos and endangered deer species — is getting new protections.  President Michelle Bachelet of Chile recently announced the creation of a 10-million-acre national park system stretching all the way south to Cape Horn, where the tip of South America splinters into fjords and canals. It’s the brainchild of Kristine McDivitt Tompkins and her husband, Douglas Tompkins, who founded The North Face and Esprit clothing companies. They had paid $345 million — much of their fortune — to buy so much land that some Chileans became worried about national security.

NYTNow,477," By KAREN ZRAICK and LANCE BOOTHFEB. 18, 2018 Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. The “mass shooting generation” is speaking out. The teenagers who survived last week’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado. Their generation grew up practicing active shooter drills — and wondering whether it could happen at their school. This week, of course, it did. And many students responded not by grieving silently, but with loud calls for gun control measures. Above, a vigil at the school. The 19-year-old suspect, Nikolas Cruz, had exhibited “every single known red flag” before the attack, and the F.B.I. failed to act on a tip last month that Mr. Cruz was a threat. Here are brief portraits of the 14 students and three staff members who were killed. ____ 2. We did a deep dive into the attack in Niger in October that left four American soldiers dead. Few Americans — even senior members of Congress — know much about the 800 U.S. troops there. They were supposed to be training and advising Nigerien soldiers, four of whom were also killed in the attack. Above, a training exercise last year.  Interviews with current and former officials, service members and witnesses point to intelligence failures and strategic miscalculations that left the soldiers in hostile territory with no backup.  More broadly, their deaths have reignited a longstanding argument in Washington over the sprawling and often opaque war against jihadist groups that began after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. ____ 3. More than a dozen Russians and three companies were charged with interfering in the 2016 elections, underscoring the conclusion that Russia is engaged in a virtual war against the U.S. It was the first indictment in connection with election meddling secured by the special counsel in the Russia investigation, Robert Mueller, above. President Trump claimed personal vindication, writing on Twitter that there was “no collusion!” Prosecutors said that Facebook and Instagram were the most frequently used tools for Russian operations that aimed to sow political discord. ____ 4. The Senate blocked three measures — including one backed by President Trump — to resolve the fate of the young people known as Dreamers. What will happen now is unclear. The program that was protecting an estimated 690,000 people from deportation was rescinded by Mr. Trump, and it will expire on March 5. Above, a protest in Washington last month. Congress is in recess this week, and immigrant rights advocates are turning their attention to the legal arena. Two federal courts have blocked the administration from ending the program, but the White House wants those rulings overturned.  The Supreme Court convened a closed-door conference on Friday to discuss whether to take up the issue immediately. ____ 5. Cyril Ramaphosa, above, took over as president of South Africa. He had been deputy president and is one of the richest men on the continent. He succeeds Jacob Zuma, who resigned after nearly nine years as president. Mr. Zuma, once known as a charismatic anti-apartheid hero, had come to symbolize the corruption that flourished during his time in office. ____ 6. Our correspondent on the ground in northern Syria met some of the fighters for the Syrian Democratic Forces. The American-backed group, which includes Kurds and Arabs, drove the Islamic State out of a large section of northeastern Syria. “We’re very proud,” said Shervan Derwish, above. “We did something for our people, and for the world.” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was in Turkey, where he met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss the diplomatic crisis between their countries over Turkey’s military operations against Kurdish forces in Syria. ____ 7. What does “natural” mean, exactly? The term is on more and more products these days, from fruit juice to shampoo to baby wipes. The problem, consumer groups say, is that there is no legal or regulatory definition of what “natural” is. That has spurred hundreds of lawsuits.  The debate echoes the tussling over the term “organic” in the 1990s. (The Department of Agriculture did eventually create a definition and certification process.) And we haven’t even gotten to “healthy” yet. ____ 8. There’s just a week to go in the Winter Olympics. We caught up with Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir, the NBC figure skating analysts who have all but upstaged the athletes with their very-big-night-out attire. They took us through some of the outfits in the 22 suitcases they took to Pyeongchang, South Korea. Here’s the full Olympic medals table, results and schedule. And you can sign up here for direct messages from our sports editor at the Games. ____ 9. Flynn the bichon frisé was crowned Best in Show at the 142nd Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York. The jovial 5-year-old cut a striking figure in the ring: His powder-puff fur was painstakingly coifed, and he trotted across the floor with a light, jaunty step. Speaking of pups, we’re ringing in the Year of the Dog, which began Friday. Our friends in Cooking have a wide selection of recipes to celebrate the Lunar New Year. ____ 10. Finally, did you keep up with the headlines last week? Test your knowledge with our news quiz.  And a friendly reminder: It’s not all bad out there. In this roundup of uplifting stories, we have snowboarder Chloe Kim’s “hangry” tweets, a postal stamp featuring Mr. Rogers, above, and an easy way to make kids happier and healthier.

                            STATE OF THE ART
                        MARCH 7, 2018 I first got news of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., via an alert on my watch. Even though I had turned off news notifications months ago, the biggest news still somehow finds a way to slip through. But for much of the next 24 hours after that alert, I heard almost nothing about the shooting. There was a lot I was glad to miss. For instance, I didn’t see the false claims — possibly amplified by propaganda bots — that the killer was a leftist, an anarchist, a member of ISIS and perhaps just one of multiple shooters. I missed the Fox News report tying him to Syrian resistance groups even before his name had been released. I also didn’t see the claim circulated by many news outlets (including The New York Times) as well as by Senator Bernie Sanders and other liberals on Twitter that the massacre had been the 18th school shooting of the year, which wasn’t true. Instead, the day after the shooting, a friendly person I’ve never met dropped off three newspapers at my front door. That morning, I spent maybe 40 minutes poring over the horror of the shooting and a million other things the newspapers had to tell me. Not only had I spent less time with the story than if I had followed along as it unfolded online, I was better informed, too. Because I had avoided the innocent mistakes — and the more malicious misdirection — that had pervaded the first hours after the shooting, my first experience of the news was an accurate account of the actual events of the day.  This has been my life for nearly two months. In January, after the breaking-newsiest year in recent memory, I decided to travel back in time. I turned off my digital news notifications, unplugged from Twitter and other social networks, and subscribed to home delivery of three print newspapers — The Times, The Wall Street Journal and my local paper, The San Francisco Chronicle — plus a weekly newsmagazine, The Economist.  I have spent most days since then getting the news mainly from print, though my self-imposed asceticism allowed for podcasts, email newsletters and long-form nonfiction (books and magazine articles). Basically, I was trying to slow-jam the news — I still wanted to be informed, but was looking to formats that prized depth and accuracy over speed. It has been life changing. Turning off the buzzing breaking-news machine I carry in my pocket was like unshackling myself from a monster who had me on speed dial, always ready to break into my day with half-baked bulletins. Now I am not just less anxious and less addicted to the news, I am more widely informed (though there are some blind spots). And I’m embarrassed about how much free time I have — in two months, I managed to read half a dozen books, took up pottery and (I think) became a more attentive husband and father. Most of all, I realized my personal role as a consumer of news in our broken digital news environment. We have spent much of the past few years discovering that the digitization of news is ruining how we collectively process information. Technology allows us to burrow into echo chambers, exacerbating misinformation and polarization and softening up society for propaganda. With artificial intelligence making audio and video as easy to fake as text, we’re entering a hall-of-mirrors dystopia, what some are calling an “information apocalypse.” And we’re all looking to the government and to Facebook for a fix. But don’t you and I also have a part to play? Getting news only from print newspapers may be extreme and probably not for everyone. But the experiment taught me several lessons about the pitfalls of digital news and how to avoid them. I distilled those lessons into three short instructions, the way the writer Michael Pollan once boiled down nutrition advice: Get news. Not too quickly. Avoid social.  I know what you’re thinking: Listening to a Times writer extol the virtues of print is like taking breakfast suggestions from Count Chocula. You may also wonder if I am preaching to the choir; doesn’t everyone reading this story already appreciate print? Probably not. The Times has about 3.6 million paying subscribers, but about three-quarters of them pay for just the digital version. During the 2016 election, fewer than 3 percent of Americans cited print as their most important source of campaign news; for people under 30, print was their least important source. I’m nearly 40, but I’m no different. Though I have closely followed the news since I was a kid, I always liked my news on a screen, available at the touch of a button. Even with this experiment, I found much to hate about print. The pages are too big, the type too small, the ink too messy, and compared with a smartphone, a newspaper is more of a hassle to consult on the go. Print also presents a narrower mix of ideas than you find online. You can’t get BuzzFeed or Complex or Slate in print. In California, you can’t even get The Washington Post in print. And print is expensive. Outside New York, after introductory discounts, seven-day home delivery of The Times will set you back $81 a month. In a year, that’s about the price of Apple’s best iPhone. The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.     What do you get for all that dough? News. That sounds obvious until you try it — and you realize how much of what you get online isn’t quite news, and more like a never-ending stream of commentary, one that does more to distort your understanding of the world than illuminate it. I noticed this first with the deal Democrats made to end the government shutdown late in January. On the Jan. 23 front pages, the deal was presented straight: “Shutdown Ends, Setting Up Clash Over ‘Dreamers,’” ran The Times’s headline on the news story, which appeared alongside an analysis piece that presented the political calculations surrounding the deal. Many of the opinions in that analysis could be found on Twitter and Facebook. What was different was the emphasis. Online, commentary preceded facts. If you were following the shutdown on social networks, you most likely would have seen lots of politicians and pundits taking stock of the deal before seeing details of the actual news. 
            I want to see the government re-open as much as anyone, but this bill fails to fix the moral issue we must solve. That's why I voted against it.         This is common online. On social networks, every news story comes to you predigested. People don’t just post stories — they post their takes on stories, often quoting key parts of a story to underscore how it proves them right, so readers are never required to delve into the story to come up with their own view.  There’s nothing wrong with getting lots of shades of opinion. And reading just the paper can be a lonely experience; there were many times I felt in the dark about what the online hordes thought about the news. Still, the prominence of commentary over news online and on cable news feels backward, and dangerously so. It is exactly our fealty to the crowd — to what other people are saying about the news, rather than the news itself — that makes us susceptible to misinformation. It’s been clear that breaking news has been broken since at least 2013, when a wild week of conspiracy theories followed the Boston Marathon bombing. As I argued then, technology had caused the break. Real life is slow; it takes professionals time to figure out what happened, and how it fits into context. Technology is fast. Smartphones and social networks are giving us facts about the news much faster than we can make sense of them, letting speculation and misinformation fill the gap. It has only gotten worse. As news organizations evolved to a digital landscape dominated by apps and social platforms, they felt more pressure to push news out faster. Now, after something breaks, we’re all buzzed with the alert, often before most of the facts are in. So you’re driven online not just to find out what happened, but really to figure it out. This was the surprise blessing of the newspaper. I was getting news a day old, but in the delay between when the news happened and when it showed up on my front door, hundreds of experienced professionals had done the hard work for me. Now I was left with the simple, disconnected and ritualistic experience of reading the news, mostly free from the cognitive load of wondering whether the thing I was reading was possibly a blatant lie. Another surprise was a sensation of time slowing down. One weird aspect of the past few years is how a “tornado of news-making has scrambled Americans’ grasp of time and memory,” as my colleague Matt Flegenheimer put it last year. By providing a daily digest of the news, the newspaper alleviates this sense. Sure, there’s still a lot of news — but when you read it once a day, the world feels contained and comprehensible rather than a blur of headlines lost on a phone’s lock screen.  You don’t need to read a print newspaper to get this; you can create your own news ritual by looking at a news app once a day, or reading morning newsletters like those from Axios, or listening to a daily news podcast. What’s important is choosing a medium that highlights deep stories over quickly breaking ones. And, more important, you can turn off news notifications. They distract and feed into a constant sense of fragmentary paranoia about the world. They are also unnecessary. If something really big happens, you will find out. This is the most important rule of all. After reading newspapers for a few weeks, I began to see it wasn’t newspapers that were so great, but social media that was so bad. Just about every problem we battle in understanding the news today — and every one we will battle tomorrow — is exacerbated by plugging into the social-media herd. The built-in incentives on Twitter and Facebook reward speed over depth, hot takes over facts and seasoned propagandists over well-meaning analyzers of news. You don’t have to read a print newspaper to get a better relationship with the news. But, for goodness’ sake, please stop getting your news mainly from Twitter and Facebook. In the long run, you and everyone else will be better off. Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjoo. Farhad Manjoo will be taking a leave of absence from the column to write a book.

NYTNow,479," By CHRIS STANFORDFEB. 19, 2018  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The Justice Department indictment against 13 people and three companies lays out in riveting detail how Russia carried out a social media campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. Posing as activists, Russians organized rallies in American cities and played on political divisions with online posts that reached hundreds of thousands of people. Our correspondent in Moscow spoke to two former trolls about their efforts. • Although  Russia sought to manipulate the American electorate, political polarization was already well established in the U.S., our Interpreter columnists write. • The indictment doesn’t accuse President Trump or his associates of wrongdoing, which he quickly said was proof that there had been “no collusion” between Russia and his campaign.  But that sense of triumph soon gave way to an angry Twitter tirade by the president, who has long disputed the idea that Moscow influenced the election in his favor.  Our fact checkers had a busy weekend looking into statements about Russian interference by Mr. Trump and a top Facebook executive. • Separately, we examined the tactics that Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump’s longtime lawyer, used to protect him. They included intimidation, hush money and a leading tabloid news business. • The mass shootings in the U.S. in recent years have forced hundreds of family members into an unwanted fellowship. Those who lost children in earlier tragedies are reaching out to grieving parents after last week’s shooting in Parkland, Fla., to console and advise, and often to recruit them to the gun control cause. • As funerals for the 17 victims  were held over the weekend, student organizers said they would march in Washington next month to demand action. “We want this to stop. We need this to stop,” said Emma González, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. “We are protecting guns more than people.” • The country is training thousands of militiamen in Syria and bringing in new technologies like drones. In the process, it is expanding a network of proxies, and redrawing the strategic map of the Middle East. Tehran’s goal, analysts say, is to build a united front in any war with Israel. • “Do not test Israel’s resolve,”  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Sunday, while brandishing what he said was part of a downed Iranian drone.  • One of the nation’s most powerful black chief executives is breaking his silence after publicly sparring with President Trump last year. Kenneth Frazier, the chief executive of the pharmaceuticals company Merck, stepped down from one of the president’s business advisory councils over Mr. Trump’s response to violence by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va. • “In this case, we were not talking about politics,” Mr. Frazier told The Times in an interview. “We were talking about the basic values of the country.” The special counsel’s charges against 13 Russians reveal a sophisticated plot to turn Americans against one another — one that seems to still be working. • WeWork, the global network of shared office spaces, has an audacious, possibly delusional plan to transform not just the way we work and live, but the very world we live in. • The currencies are virtual, but the thieves are real. Big holders of Bitcoin and Ether are being targeted by criminals seeking to exploit the ease with which vast virtual riches can be transferred. • Warren Buffett’s annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders is among the headlines to watch this week. • U.S. markets are closed today for Presidents’ Day.

When “The Feminine Mystique” started flying off the shelves, Betty Friedan’s publisher assumed that her husband had bought all the copies. The assumption encapsulated why she had written the book, published on this day in 1963. It went on to sell more than three million copies worldwide by 2000. Helping to ignite the women’s liberation movement in the U.S. in the ’60s, the book tackled what Friedan called “the problem that has no name,” a dissatisfaction among women, like herself, who were defined only by their roles as wives and mothers. The book’s premise was a “damning indictment,” a Times review said in 1963. Friedan used her success to advocate feminist causes and helped found the National Organization for Women and other groups. She died in 2006, on her 85th birthday. Though the book is held up as essential feminist reading, it has come under fire for its lack of diversity and inclusivity. But 20 years after “The Feminine Mystique” was published, Friedan wrote in The Times: “I am still awed by the revolution that book helped spark. That I was able to put it together at the time it was needed is something of a mystery to me.”  Anna Schaverien contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

National,480," Supported by By Benjamin Mueller Gov. Rick Scott of Florida said on Thursday that he would call on state lawmakers and law enforcement authorities to keep firearms away from the mentally ill. “How do we make sure that individuals with mental illness do not touch a gun?” the Republican governor said at a news conference, taking an unusually strong stance on a gun control issue. Scott Israel, the Broward County, Fla., sheriff, called on lawmakers in Washington and Tallahassee to expand police powers by allowing officers to detain people for a mental health evaluation on the basis of worrisome social media posts or “graphic threats.” And President Trump urged people to report anyone whose behavior seemed disturbed, despite the fact that there is no law on the books in Florida that would let the authorities take people’s guns in that situation. A gunman armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifle and “countless magazines” killed at least 17 people at his former high school on Wednesday. In the aftermath of the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., elected and law enforcement officials ramped up their demands for expanded authority over the mentally ill who pose a danger, although some of the officials never mentioned curbing access to guns. In doing so, they stepped into a long and complicated balancing act in the United States between public safety and the right to bear arms for people with mental health issues. Others, including some gun control and mental health advocates, point to the increasing number of states that allow law enforcement officers or, in some cases, family members or others to petition a court to temporarily take guns from people who pose a danger to themselves or others. The measures, known as “red flag laws” or extreme risk protection orders, have shown evidence of reducing suicides in Connecticut, where the first such law was passed in 1999, and in recent years have also been passed in California, Washington and Oregon. Eighteen states, including Florida, and the District of Columbia are considering such laws this year, according to a list compiled by Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group. “To claim, ‘Oh, well, you should see the signs and tell law enforcement,’ to me is disingenuous unless there is something law enforcement can do,” said Avery Gardiner, the co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Red flag laws, she said, “provide a path to remove guns from somebody in a temporary crisis.” And, she said, even if a family decides not to seek a gun restraining order, the fact that the option exists can prompt frank conversations with struggling relatives. Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers have long tried to steer the national conversation after mass shootings to the mental health of people pulling the triggers, rather than the weapons they used. That effort is belied by the fact that mental illness is not the root of most cases of gun violence, though it does pose an increased risk for suicide. As reactions poured in Thursday, Mr. Trump focused on the suspect’s mental health, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he wanted the Justice Department to study how mental illness and gun violence intersect. He said it would help law enforcement better understand how law enforcement can use existing laws to intervene before school shootings happen. “It cannot be denied that something dangerous and unhealthy is happening in our country,” Mr. Sessions told a group of sheriffs in Washington. In “every one of these cases, we’ve had advance indications and perhaps we haven’t been effective enough in intervening.” Secretary Alex M. Azar II of the Department of Health and Human Services began a multiagency news conference on the flu epidemic by addressing the Florida shootings. The administration would be “laser-focused on getting Americans with mental illness the help they need,” he said. The suspect in the Florida shooting, Nikolas Cruz, 19, had been expelled from the high school, and many former classmates avoided him, convinced he was dangerous. He was also apparently showing signs of depression, having recently lost his mother. A vast majority of guns used in 19 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check. In an analysis of some 350 mass killers going back a century, about 22 percent were found to likely have had psychosis; the rate in the general population is closer to 1 percent. A much smaller percentage had severe depression; so far there is no evidence Mr. Cruz had psychosis. Federal law forbids people who have been involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital and people found to be a danger to themselves or others from having guns. But the federal government depends on states to report such cases so it can add them to a national background check system, and reporting varies widely. Florida has entered 141,042 mental health records into the national background check system, according to the Brady Campaign. Wyoming, on the other hand, has entered four. The number of mental health records in the system has grown rapidly, to 5.2 million in 2018 from 234,628 in 2005, the Brady Campaign said. But after 20 children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, the Obama administration tried to add some people to the background check system, by requiring the Social Security Administration to submit records of some beneficiaries with severe mental illness. Some gun limits are considered effective and would have public support. Last year, Mr. Trump quietly revoked that rule, which was also opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union. Some states have tried to create their own databases of people deemed too mentally unstable to carry firearms. New York, one of the most restrictive states in the country, had put 34,500 names on its list by 2014, a figure that raised concerns among some mental health advocates that too many people had been categorized as dangerous. But that approach has largely fallen out of favor, with more states turning to red flag laws that focus not on a mental health diagnosis but rather on dangerous behavior. They bloomed in several states after the Isla Vista shooting in 2014, in which a disturbed man killed six University of California, Santa Barbara students after his family had tried unsuccessfully to alert the authorities about his troubling behavior. The laws typically allow the police or family members to petition a court for a temporary gun restraining order that might last a few weeks. After a hearing in which the person can respond to evidence, a judge can issue a final order that typically lasts up to a year and can be renewed. The restraining orders usually allow the police to seize people’s guns and restrict them from buying new ones. In Connecticut, where 762 gun seizure cases were carried out from 1999 to June 2013, a study by researchers at Duke University estimated that the law had averted approximately one suicide for every 10 to 11 gun seizure cases. “We see these laws as a way for law enforcement and families to intervene before these mass tragedies occur,” said Elizabeth Avore, the legal and policy director at Everytown for Gun Safety. “Law enforcement or family are usually the first to see this threat.” In California, efforts to expand the list of those who could petition for restraining orders to include co-workers and employers drew opposition not only from pro-gun groups like the National Rifle Association but also from the A.C.L.U. Florida is one of the less restrictive states when it comes to mental illness and guns. The police can confine people considered a danger to themselves or others for up to 72 hours as part of an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. And the police are allowed to take their guns when they are detained. But a 2009 advisory opinion by the state’s attorney general said that without an arrest or criminal charge, the police could not hold onto their weapons. Mental health experts said the proposals raised by the sheriff and Mr. Scott provoked concerns. “To say no one with mental illness should have a gun — how do you accomplish that?” said Ronald Honberg, senior policy adviser for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. “Does that mean anybody that goes to a therapist for depression or anxiety should be reported and put in a database and prohibited from purchasing a firearm? That would impact a fair number of police officers.” Benedict Carey contributed reporting.         Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS",2018-02-16,0.0011664907,Friday
Opinion,481," Supported by By Maureen Dowd WASHINGTON — During his campaign, Donald Trump often bragged about his skill as a negotiator. In conversations, he ventured that, as president, he might be able to resolve two of the most thorny and tragic dilemmas: finding peace in the Mideast and reaching a sensible compromise on guns. He said he would hop in his limo and go to N.R.A. headquarters in suburban Virginia and stay as long as it took to make a deal, noting that there were points where both sides in the debate could agree. Even if Trump once had some negotiating aptitude — his biographers say it was rare — we have seen his art-of-the-deal aspirations evaporate in a cloud of self-absorption, as one tableau of legislative chaos after another unfolds. Trump wrote in his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” that he was in favor of a ban on assault weapons and “a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.” But then the N.R.A. spent more than $30 million to get him elected. All his earlier moderate positions withered as he slavishly followed the money and applause from the basest of his base. “You came through big for me and I am going to come through for you,” he told the N.R.A. after his election, out-Hestoning Charlton Heston. After 49 people were killed in a shooting at an Orlando nightclub in June 2016, he suggested that it would have been “a beautiful, beautiful sight” if more people in the club had been armed and went “boom” at the “maniac” shooting at them. It was too hard-line even for the N.R.A. “I don’t think you should have firearms where people are drinking,” N.R.A. chief Wayne LaPierre demurred. The Orlando shooting also provided confirmation that the emotionally stunted Trump would not be a parental healer for the country, when he tweeted congratulations to himself for predicting the shooter would have links to terrorism, rather than offering comforting words to the grieving families and friends, and to shaken Americans. Last year, weeks after taking office, Trump signed a bill rolling back a regulation that made it harder for mentally ill people to buy guns. And a day after Wednesday’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., by a mentally disturbed teenager with an AR-15 who killed 14 kids and three adults trying to protect the students, the president seemed unable even to utter the word “gun.” (This, even as his favorite newspaper, Rupert Murdoch’s New York Post, blared the headline: “MR. PRESIDENT, PLEASE ACT.”) I started covering gun control back in 1989 when the first Bush administration banned imports of most semiautomatic rifles and skepticism was growing about the N.R.A.’s mantra that anyone should be able to buy anything with a trigger. In an interview at N.R.A. headquarters — which proudly displayed a model of the pistol used to assassinate Lincoln — LaPierre explained that AK semiautomatics were just uglier hunting guns and that he knew how to hunker down during periods of “hysteria” after shootings. I wrote about the heartbreaking funerals after the 2012 massacre of Sandy Hook Elementary’s “beautiful babies,” as Joe Biden called them. I profiled Chris Murphy, the estimable junior senator from Connecticut who suddenly found himself facing down the Republican N.R.A. puppets in Congress. And I wrote in disgust about President Barack Obama failing to marshal the L.B.J. mojo to push through a gun control bill after Sandy Hook even though he had 90 percent of Americans on his side and a Democratic Senate. Then I gave up. If the sight of slaughtered angels did not dent the nation’s conscience, could anything? We knew that other countries could stem mass killings, homicides and suicides with gun control and gun buybacks. But we didn’t care. In our ongoing angst about our national identity — if we weren’t John Wayne anymore, who were we? — there had been a terrible tacit judgment made: America would accept periodic human sacrifices to the trigger gods in the interest of upholding this bizarre notion that the Second Amendment is inviolate or even really threatened. We can’t even summon the energy to break the chokehold that the N.R.A. has on Republicans in Congress. Since Newtown, there have been more than 1,600 mass shootings. Each time, the outrage seems to fade faster. When societies try to protect a malevolent status quo, they become warped. The most chilling sign of this is when people look the other way as the most vulnerable members of society are preyed on. It happened with the Catholic Church, where priests caught preying on children were protected and recirculated to new parishes, where they could continue their crimes. The community shrugged. The children were collateral damage. It happened with Hollywood, when everyone knew about Harvey Weinstein’s predations yet let lovely young women, at that moment of gardenia-fragility when they thought the macher could make their dreams come true, walk into his sulfurous quarters. The community shrugged. The young women were collateral damage. Now children in this country go to school every day knowing that they are not safe, that a crazed predator could show up at any moment with an assault rifle and cut them down. America shrugs. Our children are collateral damage. The #MeToo movement has proved that spider webs of protection for predators can be ripped apart in an instant, that unspeakable things that have been tolerated for decades can suddenly be deemed intolerable. America is in the throes of great disruptions and anxieties, as we sort out our values and our future. But it doesn’t take any soul searching to know this: Treating children as collateral damage is intolerable. I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@MaureenDowd) and join me on Facebook.

Climate,482," Supported by By Lisa Friedman As the Republican Party struggles to find its footing with the next generation of voters, several conservative college groups have banded together to champion something anathema to the party: a carbon tax. The group is led by the Yale College Republicans, the main campus student organization for young Republicans at Yale, and includes other prominent Republican groups at 22 other schools around the country including Clemson University in South Carolina, North Carolina State University and Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas. Under the name Students for Carbon Dividends, the coalition is backing an idea first broached by Republican heavyweights including former Secretary of State James A. Baker III and former Secretary of State George P. Shultz: Tax the carbon pollution produced by burning fossil fuels and then return the money to consumers as a dividend in the form of monthly cash payments to individuals, both adults and children alike.  Late last month, several of the campus Republican leaders involved in the climate change coalition visited Washington to volunteer at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual gathering of conservative activists and politicians. Republican strategists said the budding movement reflected an important shift on social and environmental issues that could divide the party along generational lines. Political polls suggest that millennials are dissatisfied with what they see as politics as usual from both parties. But Republicans said they worried their ranks would bear the brunt of the shift as young people moved away from party orthodoxy on issues like guns, gay marriage and climate change.  “I think what we see is that, at a time when younger voters are rejecting party politics broadly, they’re rejecting the Republican Party at a much higher rate because what they see, according to them, is a party that doesn’t want to listen and doesn’t want to grow,” said Doug Heye, a former communications director for the Republican National Committee.  “It’s a problem right now, but it’s going to be a catastrophic problem in five years or 10 years,” Mr. Heye said. The leaders of nearly two dozen Republican student groups involved in the coalition said they and their peers accepted the scientific consensus that humans have played a significant role in warming the planet. Many said they were tired of hearing Republican leaders deny climate change and did not want their party branded as anti-science.  “As a party, we’re losing voters rapidly because of this issue,” said Kiera O’Brien, president of Harvard University’s Republican club, which is a member of the carbon-tax coalition. “I’m increasingly frustrated by the fact that the science is disputed when there’s clearly evidence of climate change. We need to have a solution for our party, but we also need a solution that’s an alternative between doing nothing or ceding everything to the government.” By embracing what they call a conservative approach, the students said they hoped to help move the Republican Party on the issue.  Under the plan the students are proposing, an initial tax of $40 per ton of carbon would be levied at the point where fossil fuels enter the economy, for instance a mine or port. The tax would increase over time. That money would then be returned to taxpayers in a per-person monthly payment, with half-payments going to children under the age of 18 and a limit of two children per family. The Climate Leadership Council created by Mr. Baker and Mr. Shultz estimates a dividend would amount to about $2,000 a year for a family of four.  As part of the deal, there would also be limitations on regulatory actions like the Clean Power Plan, which former President Barack Obama imposed to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Members of the coalition said they considered a promise to scale back future regulation key to encouraging Republican support. Alexander Posner, 22, a Yale University senior who founded the group, said he has been interested in climate change and energy for years. When he read about the climate council Mr. Baker and Mr. Shultz began last year, he signed up for an internship. Soon after, he started contacting his peers at Republican clubs across the country to sound them out on creating a coalition of their own. “We’ve had a lot of conversations, and literally not once has the validity of climate science come up,” Mr. Posner said. “I think students really want to have a solutions-based discussion.”  The coalition of 23 Republican student groups, five college Democratic clubs and three university environmental clubs comes at a unique moment of youth political activism. Students nationwide are mobilizing for gun control, inspired by the survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., and Mr. Posner said that, despite the profound differences in the two movements, young Republicans working on issues like climate change were watching the gun protests with interest. “I think the common theme here is if representatives are not responding to the desires of their constituents, in particular young people,” he said, “then young people are going to step forward. This coalition on the climate front is sort of a reflecting of the inaction of adults.” Last week the nonprofit Alliance for Market Solutions issued a survey on millennial attitudes toward climate change showing that nearly 60 percent of young Republicans acknowledge that human-induced climate change is real, and 88 percent of young Democrats. A majority of young people of both parties said they believed steps should be taken to slow or stop climate change. “Young voters don’t necessarily have strong views on what should be done about climate change, but doing nothing is not a path that most young people, including Republicans, tend to support,” said Kristen Soltis Anderson, the Republican strategist who conducted the survey.  Harrison Preddy, 22, a senior majoring in political science at North Carolina State University, said he was skeptical when he first saw Mr. Posner’s email asking him to embrace a carbon tax and dividend. But when the two spoke on the phone, Mr. Preddy said, “it started to speak to what I had been feeling we were missing for so long.”  Raised on a tobacco farm about 45 minutes outside of Raleigh, N.C. — Mr. Preddy jokes that his family couldn’t afford pesticides, so they were organic farmers before it was cool — he said accepting the science of climate change was not a leap for him because his family had long been attuned to shifting weather patterns. But, he said, he rejected the solutions put forward by Democrats, including regulations like the Clean Power Plan, because he believes they ignored economic hardships posed on communities that depend on fossil fuel production.  “I’m a strong believer that we need to take action, but at the same time I understood the plights of coal miners, the plight of economic restructuring. It’s a heart-string issue for me,” Mr. Preddy said.  Ms. O’Brien said growing up the daughter of a biology teacher near the Tongass National Forest in Alaska taught her a respect for both science and the environment. Ms. O’Brien said she has found the lack of a coherent Republican Party position on climate change her single biggest challenge in recruiting students to the conservative movement. “The question I will frequently get is, ‘Why do you hate the planet? Why do you not like science?’” she said. “We can’t be a party that’s entrenching itself in a dying planet.” Dylan Jones, chairman of the Republican club at the University of Kansas, called addressing climate change a pro-life issue. Mr. Jones, a strong supporter of President Trump, said he questions a good deal of what is said about climate change. But, he said, he believes lawmakers should find a way to protect the planet. “If the Republican Party is really the party of life, then we fight for life under every circumstance,” he said. “Now it’s time for young people like myself to come up with ideas and solutions so we can be part of the discussion and debate instead of sitting on the wayside and denouncing science.” The Republican National Committee did not return a call to discuss the group’s proposal or its strategy toward younger conservatives. The party platform established ahead of the 2016 presidential election takes no position on the science of climate change other than to say the United Nation’s scientific body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is “a political mechanism, not an unbiased scientific institution,” and that its conclusions should be assessed in that context. The I.P.C.C. is the principal international scientific body charged with reviewing climate science and issuing reports about the risks to the world's government. Mr. Baker said in an interview he believes the idea of a carbon tax and dividend can appeal to those who question climate change science. “I’m sort of a climate change skeptic,” he said. “I do think the climate is changing but I don’t know why, and I sure don’t understand the extent to which man may be responsible for it.” But, Mr. Baker added,  uncertainty about the magnitude of the threat shouldn’t be an excuse not to act. “This is a free-market based solution,” he said.

Culture,483," By SOPAN DEBMARCH 4, 2018 Jimmy Kimmel once again brought his dry, sardonic style to his role as host of the Oscars. His monologue, preceded by a black-and-white video send-up of some A-list stars, was filled with barbs against Harvey Weinstein, Mel Gibson and others. He also threw jibes at President Trump, and poked fun at last year’s Oscar envelope mix-up. What Happened Analysis Red Carpet Winners Some of his commentary needed to be taken with a grain of salt. At one point, Mr. Kimmel said, “Of the nine best picture nominees, only two of them made more than $100 million.” That may have been true domestically, but most of the films hit that total if foreign ticket sales were factored in. After a year in Hollywood marked by the #MeToo movement and Time's Up, this year's Academy Awards were dominated by calls for more diversity and inclusivity for women, people of color, immigrants and minorities. Here is a transcript of Mr. Kimmel’s monologue: And greetings from Hollywood to our viewers all around the world. Thank you for watching. Thank you very having me. It is a great honor to be invited back for a second time. It is a great honor to be here among so many talented women and men. Congratulations to all of you. You made it. We’re at the Oscars. Some of you will be going home tonight with an Academy Award. What could be better than that? Nothing, right? So — oh. I do want to mention. This year, when you hear your name called, don’t get up right away. Just give us a minute. We don’t want another thing. What happened last year was unfortunate, and I’ve not told this story in public because I wanted to save it for tonight. But here’s what happened. This is true. Last year, about a week before the show, the producers asked me if I wanted to do some comedy with the accountants. And I said, “No, I don’t want to do comedy with the accountants.” So, then the accountants went ahead and did comedy on their own. And I have to hand it to them, it was hilarious. But it won’t happen again. This year, the chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers said, and I quote, “Our singular focus will be on the show and delivering the correct envelopes,” which is — does make sense. Just out of curiosity though, what was your focus the other 89 years? I’m hopeful that things will go smoothly tonight. We can’t ruin this one. This is a special year. This is a big one. These are the 90th Academy Awards. This is history happening right here. Our friend Oscar — Oscar is 90 years old tonight, which means he’s probably at home right now watching Fox News. Of course — no, Oscar is here with us. After all the years, after all the awards given for achievements in show business, Oscar is still No. 1. No question about it. Oscar is the most beloved and respected man in Hollywood. And there’s a very good reason why. Just look at him. Keeps his hands where you can see them. Never says a rude word and most importantly, no penis at all. He is literally a statue of limitations. And that’s the kind of men we need more of in this town. Here’s how clueless Hollywood is about women. We made a movie called “What Women Want” and it starred Mel Gibson. Kind of all you need to know. The Academy, as you are no doubt aware, took action last year to expel Harvey Weinstein from their ranks. There were a lot of great nominees, but Harvey deserved it the most. And — oh, that’s nice. That’s very sweet. So, I’m sure he’ll appreciate that applause. The Academy kicked him out and after they did, I was curious, so, I looked it up. You know the only other person to be expelled from the Academy, ever, was a character actor named Carmine Caridi. In 2004, he was kicked out for sharing screeners. Carmine Caridi got the same punishment as Harvey Weinstein for giving his neighbor a copy of “Seabiscuit” on VHS. But what happened with Harvey, and what’s happening all over, was long overdue. We can’t let bad behavior slide anymore. The world is watching us. We need to set an example and the truth is if we are successful here, if we can work together to stop sexual harassment in the workplace, if we can do that, women will only have to deal with harassment all the time at every other place they go. Over the course of this evening, I hope you will listen to many brave and outspoken supporters of movements like “Me Too” and “Time’s Up” and “Never Again,” because what they’re doing is important. Things are changing for the better. They’re making sure of that. It is positive change. This is a night for positivity and our plan is to shine a light on a group of outstanding and inspiring films, each and every one of which got crushed by “Black Panther” this weekend. Which, that’s — that’s okay. The success of “Black Panther” is one of many positive stories this year. Especially for African-Americans and Bob Iger. “Black Panther” and “Wonder Woman” are — were massive hits, which is almost miraculous because I remember a time when the major studios didn’t believe a woman or a minority could open a superhero movie. And the reason I remember that time was because it was March of last year. But — this year, we have a lot to celebrate. Ceilings have been shattered. Ceilings in screenwriting. We have our first ever female nominee for cinematography, Rachel Morrison, which is historic. So many of tonight’s nominees are making history, and, in fact, if you are a nominee tonight who isn’t making history — shame on you. Greta Gerwig is the first woman to be nominated for director in eight years. And that’s important. Only 11 percent of movies are directed by women. And that is nuts. We still have a very long way to go in that department, and a very long way to go when it comes to equal pay. Especially when you look at what happened with Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams. We all know the story. Mark Wahlberg was paid a million-and-a-half dollars to reshoot his scenes while Michelle Williams for her reshoots got a per diem. She was paid 80 dollars a day for the same thing. And what made it especially unfair is that Mark and Michelle are represented by the same agency. And I have to admit, this story really surprised me. This one shook me, because if we can’t trust agents, who can we trust? To his credit, Mark Wahlberg announced he would be donating all $1.5 million to the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund. That’s right. So, I guess now the ball’s in your court, Michelle. What are you going to do with that 80 bucks? In the meantime, triple congratulations are in order for the kid from Comedy Central, Jordan Peele, who had a huge success with his movie, “Get Out.” Jordan is only the third person in 90 years to be nominated for directing, writing and best picture for his debut film. And what — what a debut it was. None other than President Trump called “Get Out” the best first three-quarters of a movie this year. Margot Robbie had a great year. Margot scored her first nomination for her portrayal of Tonya Harding in “I, Tonya” and was terrific. Whose kneecaps did Tonya Harding have to break to get this dream casting? Because, I mean, that was — if they made a movie about my life, best case scenario, I’d be played by Jim Belushi. Another exceptionally gifted young actor who is nominated for the first time is Timothée Chalamet, who looks very dashing tonight. Wow, look at that tux. Are you having fun, Timothée? This is a big deal. He’s missing “Paw Patrol” to be here tonight. Don’t worry, Ryder and his team of pups saved the day, so. Timothée is the star of a small but powerful story called “Call Me by Your Name,” which did not make a lot of money. In fact, of the nine best picture nominees, only two of them made more than $100 million. That’s not the point. We don’t make films like “Call Me by Your Name” for money. We make them to upset Mike Pence. Right? Timothée is the youngest best actor nominee in almost 80 years, and on the other end of the abacus, we have our oldest acting nominee ever: The magnificent Christopher Plummer is 88 years old and still going strong. Maybe this is not the place, but there’s something I want to ask you. How does Lin-Manuel Miranda compare to the real Alexander Hamilton? And once again, right here in the front row, maybe the greatest actor of all time, Meryl Streep is here with us. She earned her 21st Oscar nomination. Meryl’s film career started in 1977. The longest she ever went without being nominated was from 1992 to 1995, which — and that’s only because those were the years she was in prison, and that, I think, is amazing. The most nominated movie tonight, a film that’s up for 13 Oscars, is “The Shape of Water,” written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, a wonderful man. Congratulations, I’m very happy for Guillermo. You made a beautiful movie and thanks to Guillermo, we will always remember this year as the year men screwed up so badly, women started dating fish. O.K., before we start handing out the awards, some history, because we’re going to do things a little bit differently. The first Oscar ceremony lasted, and this is true, 15 minutes, from beginning to end. And people still complained. But — so, if you do win an Oscar tonight, we want you to give a speech. We want you to say whatever you feel needs to be said. Speak from the heart. We want passion. You have an opportunity and a platform to remind millions of people about important things like equal rights and equal treatment. If you want to encourage others to join the amazing students at Parkland at their march on the 24th, do that. If you want to thank a favorite teacher, do that. Or maybe you just want to thank your parents and tell your kids to go to sleep. What you say is entirely up to you. You don’t have to change the world. Do whatever you want. But with that said, this is a really long show. So here’s what we’re going to do. Not saying you shouldn’t give a long speech, but whoever gives the shortest speech tonight will go home with — Johnny, tell them what they’ll win. [ANNOUNCER’S VOICE] It’s a brand new jet ski! Easy comfort on the 2018 Kawasaki ULTRA 310-LX. The No. 1 choice for watercraft enthusiasts. Retail price, $17,999. Back to you, Jimmy. [BACK TO KIMMEL] Thank you, Helen. Helen Mirren not included. So — there you go. Why waste precious time thanking your mom when you could be taking her for the ride of her life on a brand new jet ski? This is not a joke. I will be timing you. I have a stop watch. The moment you are handed that Oscar, the clock will start ticking, So, get up here, grab it and go. And in the unlikely event of a tie, I need to say, the jet ski will be awarded to Christopher Plummer, so — let’s get the show going.  See More » ",2018-03-05,0.0011518723,Monday
Business,484," With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 5, 2018 Good Monday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Fed is working on ‘material changes’ to Volcker Rule. • Will Quarles end the post-Volcker quiet? • Big foreign banks and the Senate’s deregulation bill. • S.&P. 500 futures are down amid tariff threats and Italy’s election results. • How Washington intervened in Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. • The school protection industry is seeing business get busier. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Changes are coming to the so-called Volcker Rule, the post-financial crisis era measure intended to rein in aggressive trading by Wall Street banks.  The Federal Reserve is in the process of working with other regulatory agencies to make “material changes” to the rule. Randal K. Quarles, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, said the central bank is working toward rewriting portions of the Volcker Rule during a speech on Monday.  Mr. Quarles took issue with many parts of the rule — inspired by Paul Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Quarles said the rule was “an example of a complex regulation that is not working well,” and that the Fed is working on revisions to make the rule less burdensome to firms that do not have large trading desks. Mr. Quarles did not give a time-frame to revise the rule but said the Fed’s goal was to write something that would formally be submitted for public comment. He said regulators want to make “clearer and more transparent” what kind of trading is governed by the Volcker Rule — something he said has been a source of frustration for regulators and bankers. The Volcker Rule has been credited with curtailing the ability of banks to make risky and speculative trades for their own account — which some contend contributed to some of the excesses that led up to the financial crisis of a decade ago. — Matthew Goldstein The Federal Reserve is gearing up for a far-reaching overhaul of the Volcker Rule. The rule’s critics, including Randal K. Quarles, head of supervision at the Fed, say it is too burdensome on banks. But there may be one group of people who hope that the Fed doesn’t gut the rule: Investors in bank stocks. Since the Volcker Rule took effect in 2015, they’ve been able to worry much less about traders saddling their institutions with overwhelming losses. In fact, there hasn’t been a big trading meltdown at a large United States bank since the London Whale debacle at JPMorgan Chase, which happened prior to 2015 and arguably lit a fire under regulators to finalize the rule. Contrary to some analyses of the financial crisis, proprietary trading contributed to the weakness of financial system . Who can forget Morgan Stanley’s disastrous subprime wager that saddled the bank with $9 billion of losses?  And by shedding proprietary traders, banks may have dodged no end of bullets. When a star commodities trader, Andrew J. Hall, left Citigroup, there was concern that the bank lost a crucial money maker. But the hedge fund Mr. Hall ran after he left Citigroup suffered outsize losses. And the list of bank traders who later racked up big losses at hedge funds is not short. — Peter Eavis The retailer has rejected its founding family’s takeover offer. A group of Nordstrom family members, which control 21 percent of the company, had offered $50 a share for the shares it does not already own. The Special Committee has directed its advisors and management not to provide further due diligence information to the Group. Furthermore, unless the Group can promptly and substantially improve the price it is proposing to pay for the Company, the Special Committee intends to terminate discussions. It was a brash move, even by Wall Street’s standards. Deutsche Bank, a giant German bank with a big trading business in the United States, took emergency loans from the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis a decade ago. But later, Deutsche Bank changed the legal classification of its Wall Street operations, a step that for a time shielded it from United States banking regulations. Deutsche Bank’s actions, and those of other large foreign banks during that period, now loom over a piece of banking deregulation legislation that the Senate may approve this week. The bill loosens the part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 overhaul of the United States financial system, that imposed stricter regulations on larger banks, including foreign ones. Specifically, the bill — sponsored by Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho — would lighten the regulation of banks that have less than $250 billion in loans, securities and other assets, a group that includes American banks like SunTrust and BB&T. But the bill’s critics are concerned that it would allow far larger foreign banks to chip away at rules designed to prevent them wriggling out of United States safeguards. The authors of the new bill reject such fears. “Folks are peddling a lot of misinformation about our bipartisan bill, but if you look at the bill text you will see that large foreign banks will be subject to the same enhanced prudential standards,” Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, said in a statement. “Our legislation provides targeted regulatory relief for local lenders in Montana and rural America.” (“Enhanced prudential standards” is the regulatory term for stricter rules.) And the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, speaking before a Senate committee last week, said he did not think the bill would allow foreign banks to operate under a softer set of rules.  Mr. Powell based his assertion on how Dodd-Frank is written. It states that banks over $50 billion in consolidated assets require stricter oversight. The new bill moves that up to $250 billion. But even though the likes of Deutsche Bank, UBS and Credit Suisse have less than $250 billion in United States assets, they have far more than that on a consolidated basis around the world. And since the new bill does not amend the part of Dodd-Frank that requires regulators to use consolidated assets, the Fed can continue to apply its enhanced regulations to foreign banks. So, why are opponents of the bill, like Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, concerned? They point to remarks made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Congress earlier this year. When Senator Brown asked Mr. Mnuchin if he believed the new bill would reduce regulations for foreign banks, he said: “That is correct.” Indeed, the Treasury, when it set out its aims in a report last year for reducing financial regulations, included relief for foreign banks. (A Treasury official on Monday sought to clarify Mr. Mnuchin’s answer to Senator Brown. The official said Mr. Mnuchin was responding to the senator’s remarks about the Treasury’s report that came before his question about the impact of Senator Crapo’s bill.) Critics also point out that the Fed in part based its post-crisis rules for foreign banks on language in Dodd-Frank that required the rules establish fair competition between foreign and domestic banks. If the bill passes, and the Fed gives foreign banks no relief from certain regulations, the foreign banks could argue in a lawsuit that they are competitively disadvantaged against American banks with assets under $250 billion that did get such relief, some opponents of the bill contend. And the Fed did in one place veer from using consolidated assets when applying regulations to foreign banks. The Fed in 2014 said that foreign banks with less than $50 billion in United States assets (not a global consolidated measure) would be eligible for less stringent requirements under its foreign banking rule. That could create the grounds for raising that bar for lighter regulation from to $250 billion from $50 billion, critics of the bill argue. But supporters of the bill contend that United States laws give the Fed substantial leeway to continue applying stricter regulation to foreign banks. What might happen if Senator Crapo’s bill passes? It seems unlikely that big foreign banks are going to get an immediate pass from stricter regulations. But the pre-crisis period shows that, over a longer period, banks and their lawyers press for changes when they see regulators relax. — Peter Eavis The most dramatic story in M.&A. has taken another twist — one that raises questions about how assertively the Trump administration will regulate deal-making.  What happened: The U.S. government panel that reviews deals for national security concerns, known as Cfius, has asked Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, scheduled for tomorrow, by 30 days so it could further review Broadcom’s hostile takeover bid. Broadcom’s response pulled no punches, accusing Qualcomm of covertly reaching out to regulators: This was a blatant, desperate act by Qualcomm to entrench its incumbent board of directors and prevent its own stockholders from voting for Broadcom’s independent director nominees. Why: Members of Cfius have asked whether the takeover could put the U.S. behind China in the race for 5G wireless technology. Qualcomm’s biggest rival in the space is Huawei, and Qualcomm has argued that Broadcom, a serial acquirer and noted cost-cutter, could hurt crucial 5G research and development. (And Michael noted on Friday that there’s more to it than that.) Where the vote stands: Many early votes favored Broadcom: The shareholder advisory firms I.S.S. and Glass, Lewis recommended giving it at least four seats. But a top-30 investor, Parnassus, had said it supported Qualcomm. Michael hears that both sides have been especially focused on lobbying the biggest shareholders, BlackRock and Vanguard. The bigger picture: The White House has already blocked the sale of a U.S. tech company to a Chinese buyer on national security grounds. If it steps in here — in an unusually aggressive move by Cfius, which normally acts after a proposed deal is filed for review — would deal makers lose heart? The deals flyaround • Axa of France agreed to buy the XL Group, a reinsurer, for $15.3 billion in cash — the biggest takeover of a U.S. insurer by a European one.

(Bloomberg) Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.     The Infatuation is set to announce on Monday that it has bought Zagat from Google. From Michael de la Merced: The deal will bolster the profile of the nine-year-old The Infatuation. But it also raises questions about whether Zagat, once the 800-pound gorilla of restaurant recommendations, can remain relevant when a slew of younger digital competitors have emerged and thrived. Background Then Google bought Zagat seven years ago under the direction of Marissa Mayer, who went on to become Yahoo’s chief executive. The plan was to integrate it into its mapping service, but life under Google has sometimes been rocky for the business, including a de-emphasizing of Zagat content in favor of Google’s own collected recommendations. About The Infatuation The company was founded nine years ago by Chris Stang and Andrew Steinthal, who a way to recommend restaurants and bars to their friends. The company has succeeded in part by embracing technologies both new and old: It popularized “#EEEEEATS” as a branded hashtag on Instagram, and runs a slew of food-related accounts on the social network. It also rolled out Text Rex, a texting recommendation service staffed by humans to recommend eateries for users’ particular situations. The company said it became profitable last year. White House officials like Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and senior trade adviser Peter Navarro asserted on the Sunday talk shows that tariffs on steel and aluminum are definitely coming — though they didn’t say when.  And the move may affect more than raw metal either: Mr. Trump threatened tariffs on cars imported from the E.U. if it retaliates. (He didn’t mention the ones that Daimler and BMW make in G.O.P.-leaning Southern states.) Big question 1: How will China react? So far, it has been cautious, in part because Chinese steel makes up just 2 percent of American steel imports. U.S. allies who stand to be hit have been far more outspoken. Big question 2: Will Gary Cohn, who favors free trade but was shot down at a meeting on Thursday, finally leave the White House?

They say that since they, too, take deposits from other banks and stash them at the Fed, they should get the same relief — even though that is not the primary focus of their business. Lobbyists for the two banks are hoping to persuade lawmakers to change the bill to allow all banks that accept custodial deposits to take advantage of the exemption, according to people familiar with the banks’ efforts.

Express,485," By CHRISTINE HAUSERFEB. 16, 2018 With mass shootings in schools, theaters, churches and workplaces, experts in threat assessment have come up with advice about what to do. This is a grim topic for an advice article, and the odds that you personally will be a victim of a mass shooting are low. But experts say mass shootings have become so frequent and deadly in the United States that people should think in advance about how they will respond if the worst happens. In general, they have settled on a simple guideline: “run, hide, fight.” The specific situation and location matters. “There is never going to be a universal rule for this,” said Bob Kolasky, an acting deputy undersecretary for the Department of Homeland Security who oversees active shooter training. The department has published detailed advice, defining an “active shooter” as someone with a gun engaged in killing or trying to kill people in a confined and populated place.  The advice is based on actual cases. It can be chilling to consider, but the more prepared you are, the better your chances of survival.  “There is chaos,” Mr. Kolasky said. “The more you have got protocols in place, the more likely you are to minimize the damage.” When you hear gunfire, the first response should be to escape. But would you know how to escape? Experts advise being familiar with quick routes out of your workplace. And whenever you are in a new location, take note of the exits. Use them if you are sure that your path will not take you in the gunman’s direction. “If you can get away from that person, that is the best thing to do,” said Pete Blair, a criminal justice professor and the executive director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University. If on a higher floor, don’t use elevators; take the stairs. Windows are also an option. Students at Virginia Tech escaped the gunman in 2007 from a second-floor window. If you believe you are in the gunman’s line of sight, run in a zigzag, or from cover to cover. Do not pull a fire alarm. That creates confusion as to whether what is happening is a drill, as happened in the recent shooting in Parkland, Fla., where the gunman himself pulled the alarm, the authorities said. An alarm could send people out of rooms and into large groups in hallways, where they would be targets, and draw emergency responders into danger as well. Instead, yell “gun” or “gunman.” Many workplaces and schools use drills to prepare workers and students for lockdowns and evacuations.  But if you are someplace like a theater, look for the exits yourself. Mr. Kolasky, who worked with the National Association of Theatre Owners after the Aurora theater shooting in 2012, said public service announcements in theaters often point them out. But they are only successful “to the degree that people pay attention,” he said. If escape is not an option, you should hide, although Dr. Blair prefers to use the more active term “deny access” rather than what he calls “hide and hope.” Dart into a room, closet, anywhere there is a door to lock, or at least to close and barricade. A room near an elevator is good because there is likely to be reinforced construction at the core of the building, noted Park Dietz, founder and president of Threat Assessment Group. Other office walls are often thin drywall. You can also hide under your desk if there is no alternative. It’s not the best choice, but removing yourself from the line of sight and gunfire is better than nothing. Playing dead is generally not a good idea, Dr. Blair said. Gunmen have been known to circle back and fire into wounded people or others on the ground, he said. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.     But in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, a teacher remained motionless after being shot in the leg and then escaped after the gunman had moved on. A student at Virginia Tech was shot while fleeing but kept going and survived. “Keep operating if shot,” Dr. Blair said. “Try to get yourself out.” Don’t stop to grab belongings, not even your cellphone. But if you do have one, once you are hidden, call 911, identify yourself and explain briefly what is happening and where. Then silence the phone or stop speaking but leave it on so the dispatcher can hear. Turn off lights. Do not talk with others in the room if the gunman is nearby. “Stay quiet as a mouse,” Dr. Dietz said.  Social media use might give away your location or help the attacker know where the police are, Dr. Blair warned. Stay low in your hiding place, because a gunman is likely to open fire at torso or head-level, Dr. Dietz said. If a barricade or lock is not available, Dr. Blair suggests not lying on the floor, because that would prevent you from the last resort: a surprise attack on the gunman if he bursts into the room. Throw or use whatever you have at hand as a weapon against the gunman — scissors, bookends, chairs, a hammer, kettle bells, heavy doorstops. It’s not ideal, but it has helped, Dr. Dietz said. If you are strong enough, wrestle or jump the gunman if he stops to reload, which could take just seconds. That is how some stopped the gunman who shot former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and others at a supermarket near Tucson, Ariz., in 2011. “There is no level of response that is going to be inappropriate,” Dr. Blair said. “I would encourage you to not go softly.” All of the experts emphasized that confronting the attacker was a last resort. “Most individuals are not trained to take down a shooter,” Mr. Kolasky said.  If you are safely hidden, think twice about opening the door again, even for colleagues or friends who are knocking or calling for help. “Only open the door for someone else if you know the shooter is not in the area,” Dr. Dietz said. If someone near you is bleeding and it would not jeopardize your safety, try to stop the flow, particularly if the wound is spurting arterial blood, which can lead to death within minutes. Use a tourniquet to slow bleeding if possible but be aware that untrained people can cause harm with one. Apply pressure to stanch blood from less severe wounds, and elevate them. Run your hands down a person’s body to find injuries. “Sometimes people get shot and don’t even realize it,” Dr. Blair said. When the police arrive, they might not be sure immediately who the suspect is. Put your hands up and spread your fingers to show you are not carrying anything that could be mistaken for a gun. Do not hug the officers, ask them questions or request first aid. Show them, do not tell them, that you are not part of the threat. “It is not the time to communicate,” Mr. Kolasky said.

NYTNow,486," By CHRIS STANFORDFEB. 15, 2018  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Nikolas Cruz was charged today with 17 counts of murder in the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Our live briefing has the latest. Here’s what we know about Mr. Cruz, 19, who had been expelled from the school and was described as a “troubled kid” who enjoyed showing off his firearms. Here’s our full story on Wednesday’s attack, and a map of what happened inside the school. • The numbers are mind-numbing: More than 430 people have been shot in 273 school attacks since the one at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012. Three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history were in the past five months. Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., hid in closets as a gunman fired a semiautomatic weapon into their classrooms. Seventeen people were killed. • A bipartisan group of senators reached an agreement on Wednesday to pay for President Trump’s proposed wall on the southern border, and to resolve the fate of undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.  But the president has said he would veto any plan that didn’t take a harder approach. • Protections for the so-called Dreamers begin expiring on March 5. We look at how the  proposals in Congress would affect them, and at five other immigration issues.  • Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff, has given his first extended description of his roller-coaster six months in the West Wing. “Take everything you’ve heard and multiply it by 50,” he writes. • Separately, President Trump said on Wednesday that he was “totally opposed to domestic violence,” his first public condemnation of the alleged conduct that forced a senior aide to resign last week. • The country inspired the world under the leadership of Nelson Mandela. But it became known for corruption and other problems during the nearly nine-year presidency of Jacob Zuma, who resigned on Wednesday after his party, the African National Congress, turned against him. • We look at  what went wrong under his leadership, and the decline of the A.N.C., which Mr. Zuma once said would govern South Africa until Jesus returned. • The American skier Mikaela Shiffrin won the gold medal in today’s giant slalom, the first in a possible multi-medal haul at the Winter Olympics. She is set to compete in the slalom on Friday, after schedules were rearranged because of high winds. After winning gold in the halfpipe, the snowboarder Shaun White was asked about sexual harassment allegations leveled against him in 2016. Initially dismissing the claims as “gossip,” White later told The Times: “I regret my behavior of many years ago and am sorry that I made anyone — particularly someone I considered a friend — uncomfortable.” • Here are today’s results from the Games.

Canada has one of the world’s most recognizable flags — one that is 53 years old, but took far longer to create. The red-and-white flag with the silhouette of a maple leaf was raised for the first time on this day in 1965. Previously, Canada had flown the Union Jack as a member of the British Commonwealth. An unofficial flag known as the Canadian Red Ensign, bearing the Union Jack and the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada, had been used on government buildings.  A national maple leaf flag was first suggested in 1895, but it wasn’t until 1964 that the Canadian Parliament approved it. Prime Minister Lester Pearson had proposed a “truly distinctive” flag that represented all the cultures in Canada, not just its French or British colonial identity. A committee evaluated thousands of designs (including one with a beaver wearing a Mountie hat). The flag was bitterly debated, especially by Mr. Pearson and his predecessor, the opposition leader John Diefenbaker. (Mr. Diefenbaker called the maple leaf motif “a flag without a past” and wept when it was inaugurated.) But even though its tree doesn’t grow nationwide, the maple leaf was considered a neutral symbol. “It was the perfect, perhaps the prototypical, Canadian compromise,” the historian Rick Archbold wrote. Jennifer Jett contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning. Browse past briefings here.

Business,487," With Andrew Ross Sorkin APRIL 18, 2018 Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Morgan Stanley reported a 42 percent jump in first-quarter profit. • The will-he-or-won’t-he Trump trade policy • Will Google become the next target of privacy inquiries? Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. The world needs a way to tell whether President Trump wants to pursue his combative trade policies. The Trump administration has in recent weeks announced a barrage of trade actions. First, Mr. Trump said he was imposing tariffs against steel and aluminum imports from a range of countries. Then came announcements of actions against China that included tariffs on a large number of products. Very few restrictions have come into effect, though. President Trump has allowed temporary exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs. The moves against China have to go through a public comment process before they can take place.  Investors, executives and farmers who have concerns about the economic impact of the trade actions may like that little has so far happened. And they may hope that Mr. Trump uses the leeway he has under trade law to step back from his threats. But supporters of tougher trade policies will be watching closely to see if Mr. Trump actually carries them out.  In the coming months, there are a number of important dates at which the Trump administration has to decide whether it wants to retreat, delay, negotiate, fight on or escalate. To help assess the stance of the United State in this trade standoff, DealBook has compiled these dates. Before looking ahead, it’s important to note that the Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on some countries. On March 23, tariffs were applied to imports of steel and aluminum from countries that were not granted an exemption. Those currently enjoying the reprieve are Canada, Mexico, Australia, South Korea, Brazil and members of the European Union. The next big deadline is May 1, which is when the exemptions on steel and aluminum tariffs expire. Between now and then, members of the Trump administration have to decide whether they want to take an action that could upset staunch allies of the United States. The United States may extend the exemptions if discussions occur or make them permanent if, say, countries agree to side with the United States in its trade offensive against China. But holding off on the steel and aluminum tariffs for a long time might embolden China, which the United States has targeted with separate actions that focus on China alone. These include two sets of tariffs, one on $50 billion of goods and a threated second set on products worth $100 billion, as well as an action at the World Trade Organization. The administration can’t announce a final list of goods for the $50 billion of tariffs until May 22. That is when the period for public responses to the tariffs ends. Trade law gives President Trump the power to then impose the tariffs quickly, but it also provides him significant flexibility on the timing. The trade legislation states that the United States would have to act within 12 months of the date at which the United States trade representative initiated its investigation of Chinese trade practices. This implies the Trump administration has until August 18.  But the legislation suggests it has even more latitude. Once the administration has determined what actions it will take, it can in theory delay putting them into effect by 180 days. Hypothetically, President Trump could stretch things into early next year. Much remains up in the air, though. Mr. Trump has the power to pursue trade policy almost at whim. He could argue for extended exemptions for Canada and Mexico, which are also involved in negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement. South Korea may also end up with significant tariff exemptions as a result of a trade agreement that country is apparently close to forging with the United States. And that action against China at the World Trade Organization could take years. — Peter Eavis One of Wall Street’s biggest (and nerdiest) contests is between Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. With each quarter’s earnings, the banks disclose their return on equity, a number that shows the profitability of the equity capital they have deployed in their businesses. Goldman usually wins. From 2010 until 2017, Morgan Stanley’s annual return on equity was stronger in only two of those eight years, and those two years were not good ones for Wall Street overall. A big test was going to be how these banks fared in unambiguously good conditions, like those that existed in the first quarter of this year, when trading activity was strong and the economic outlook bullish. Goldman’s return on equity in the first quarter was 15.4 percent, compared to 14.9 percent for Morgan Stanley. In other words, Goldman clinched the bragging rights. But with some rounding, they both achieved a 15 percent return. — Peter Eavis The Wall Street firm reported record revenue and profit for the first quarter driven by a jump in trading and the new tax law. • Morgan Stanley reported profits of $2.58 billion, up 40 percent from a year ago. That also topped analysts’ expectations of $2.2 billion in earnings, according to Thomson Reuters.  • Earnings per share came in at $1.45, beating the $1.25 analysts had expected. • Revenues increased 13.7 percent to $11.08 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $10.36 billion. • Total trading revenue rose 26 percent to $4.40 billion. • Equity trading revenue increased to $2.6 billion, up 30 percent from a year ago • Fixed-income trading revenue rose 9 percent to $1.8 billion. • Fees from investment banking rose 7 percent to $1.51 billion. • Fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions gained 16 percent to $574 million. • Underwriting revenues rose 2 percent. • Wealth management revenues increased 8 percent to $2.37 billion. Bloomberg reports that the latest data from the International Monetary Fund projects U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio to “widen to 116.9 percent by 2023 while Italy’s is seen narrowing to 116.6 percent.” The I.M.F. numbers are just the latest highlighting the negative impact the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts could have on the fiscal outlook of the United States. That seems out — for now, anyway, given President Trump’s tweet from Mar-a-Lago yesterday: “Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work.” Here are a few takeaways about the end of a public flirtation: • Trade partners and allies are again left wondering about the White House’s trade policy. That’s especially pertinent as the U.S. continues to feud with China; yesterday the F.C.C. blocked wireless carriers from using federal subsidies to buy Chinese telecom equipment. • The tweet put Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, who’s at Mar-a-Lago with Mr. Trump, in an awkward position. Japan has been leery of a bilateral trade pact with the U.S., since it risks having to make more concessions than in the TPP with little hope of much in return. Tokyo would like exemptions from potential U.S. tariffs, however.  Fact-check: Despite Mr. Trump’s tweet, South Korea isn’t in the TPP. Elsewhere in trade: China’s plans to relax foreign ownership rules for carmakers could be great for Elon Musk and bad for Warren Buffett. Or, in Mr. Musk’s case, maybe not. Facebook has born the brunt of fury over the tech industry’s practices, particularly after the Cambridge Analytica scandal shed light on how user data is shared. But another behemoth’s practices could come under scrutiny, particularly if Democrats take back Congress in the midterm elections. More from Mark Bergen and Ben Brody of Bloomberg: Two years ago, Google altered its offerings in a way that makes it more vulnerable to data-sharing scrutiny. Advertisers using its DoubleClick system to target and measure ads could start anonymously combining web-tracking data (from “cookies” that follow users online) with potent Google information including search queries, location history, phone numbers and credit card information. Until then, Google had steadfastly kept that data separate. Another thought on Google’s weaknesses, from our colleague Mike Isaac: Elsewhere in privacy: Facebook has previewed how its privacy policies are changing to comply with European regulations. Those same rules have emboldened the company to resume face-scanning photographs in Europe — if consumers opt in. Eduardo Porter argues that Facebook is creepy, but still potentially good for you. Justices appeared split yesterday over whether U.S. states could force online retailers to collect sales tax somewhere they had no physical presence. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.     Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that Congress, rather than the Supreme Court, should settle the matter. But Chief Justice John Roberts said “it would be very strange for us to tell Congress it ought to do something in any particular area.” The stakes: The case in question, South Dakota v. Wayfair, could upend a decades-old status quo in online retail — and bring states some much-needed revenue. Elsewhere in taxes: Morgan Stanley analysts say they are uncertain whether the Republican tax overhaul will extend the boom in U.S. business. The chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers asserts that the changes will benefit American workers the most. President Trump filed for a six-month extension for preparing his income taxes. And if you think your taxes are complicated, be glad (on one level) that you’re not Meghan Markle. • Starbucks will close its more than 8,000 U.S. stores for a day of anti-bias training on May 29, after outrage over the arrest of two African-American men at a Philadelphia store. It’s a positive example for corporate America, Breakingviews says.  • David Hogg, a survivor of the Parkland, Fla. school shooting, called for a boycott of BlackRock and Vanguard because of their holdings in gun makers like Sturm Ruger.

(WaPo) Even before it emerged as a target of international scorn, the consulting firm sought to develop a virtual currency and raise money through an initial coin offering, the NYT reports. (The project, which was led by the former C.E.O. Alexander Nix, appears to be on hold.) More from Nathaniel Popper and Nicholas Confessore of the NYT: The goal of Cambridge Analytica’s own coin offering? Raise money that would pay for the creation of a system to help people store and sell their online personal data to advertisers, Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, said in an interview. The idea was to protect information from more or less what the firm did when it obtained the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.

(BuzzFeed) • IBM posted a second consecutive quarter of higher revenue after nearly six years of decline, an indication that Ginni Rometty’s turnaround may be taking hold. (WSJ) • The cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has stopped trading services for Japanese residents after regulators there stepped up oversight. (WSJ) The Wall Street firm’s first-quarter earnings raise a familiar dilemma. As Goldman moves to diversify its operations beyond high-risk trading — one notable example is its Marcus online bank — the strength of its trading shop in the first quarter threatens to overshadow those efforts, Peter Eavis writes. Stock and bond markets are unpredictable, even in good times, so the helpful trading conditions this quarter may not last. What can Goldman’s senior executives offer to persuade investors that the bank far more than a trading house? More explanations, perhaps — and time. In tax-related news: The U.S.’s four biggest banks benefited from the Republican tax cuts — to the tune of $2.5 billion. • Bill Ackman said that Newell Brands had “made a deal with the devil,” after it agreed terms with Carl Icahn to avoid a proxy fight with Starboard Value.

Investigative,489," By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and GABRIEL J.X. DANCEFEB. 20, 2018 When Hilary Mason, a data scientist and entrepreneur, discovered that dozens of automated “bot” accounts had sprung up to impersonate her on Twitter, she immediately set out to stop them. She filed dozens of complaints with Twitter, repeatedly submitting copies of her driver’s license to prove her identity. She reached out to friends who worked at the company. But days later, many of the fake accounts remained active, even though virtually identical ones had been shut down. Millions of accounts impersonating real people roam social media platforms, promoting commercial products and celebrities, attacking political candidates and sowing discord. They spread fake images and misinformation about the school shooting last week in Parkland, Fla. They were central to Russian attempts to sway the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald J. Trump, according to a federal grand jury indictment on Friday. And American intelligence officials believe they will figure in Russian efforts to shape the coming midterm elections, too. Yet social media companies often fail to vigorously enforce their own policies against impersonation, an examination by The New York Times found, enabling the spread of fake news and propaganda — and allowing a global black market in social identities to thrive on their platforms.  Facebook and Twitter require proof of identity to shut down an impostor account but none to set one up. And even as social media accounts evolve into something akin to virtual passports — for shopping, political activity and even gaining access to government services — technology companies have devised their own rules and standards, with little oversight or regulation from Washington.  “These companies have, in a lot of ways, assigned themselves to be validators of your identity,” said Jillian York, an official at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates digital privacy protections. “But the vast majority of users have no access to any due process, no access to any kind of customer service — and no means of appealing any kind of decision.” Some impostor accounts are set up as pranks. Millions of them are controlled by private companies that sell fake followers and other forms of social media engagement to celebrities, professional athletes and authors. Many others are deployed in systematic information warfare campaigns waged by governments. In congressional hearings last week, some lawmakers questioned whether social media businesses were doing enough. “I think the companies themselves were slow to recognize this threat,” said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. “I think they’ve still got more work to do.” Leaders of some social media companies have said they are trying hard to grapple with impersonation. In an earnings call this month, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, said the company was expanding what it calls “information quality” efforts, including ways of elevating credible and authentic content on the platform. Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, wrote in a Facebook post in January that the company had nearly doubled the number of workers who review content for fake news and abuse, including impersonation. Facebook’s terms of service prohibit impersonation and require that account holders generally use their real names. Twitter, however, allows parody accounts and pseudonyms, and only forbids impersonation when that account portrays another user “in a misleading or deceptive manner.” The company does not proactively review accounts for impersonation.  That policy can leave real users mystified or enraged. In December, Firoozeh Dumas, an Iranian-American memoirist who lives in Germany, repeatedly reported to Twitter at least four accounts impersonating hers. “They have my photos, they tweet things from my books,” she said. “One of them seems to be selling things.” Yet each time Ms. Dumas reported them, emails show, Twitter’s support team told her the accounts did not meet its definition of abusive impersonation. A Times investigation last month found that many real accounts are copied and turned into automated “bots” sold by companies like Devumi, a firm now based in Colorado that is under investigation by attorneys general in Florida and New York. (Through a spokesman, Devumi has denied selling fake accounts.) One victim was Erin Barnes, a publicist and writer in Colorado. A bot sold by Devumi used not only her name and portrait, but also a background photograph of her husband and young daughter. “It makes my skin crawl,” Ms. Barnes said.      The account was suspended only recently, after Ms. Barnes — alerted by The Times — reported it to Twitter. “If you’re using somebody’s photos and name together, then that’s impersonation,” she complained. Twitter appears to be tracking Devumi’s network of bots. Since the Times investigation was published, dozens of Devumi’s most prominent clients — actors, reality TV stars, authors, business executives and others seeking to buy followers and retweets — have lost more than three million followers. Close to 55,000 impostor accounts sold by Devumi have been restricted or suspended. Twitter has declined to say whether Devumi’s bots violate its impersonation policy, or how many of its employees are focused on rooting out impersonation. The company’s first line of defense against impersonation is the countermeasures that flag accounts that run afoul of Twitter policies on spam — violations that can be easier for the platform to identify and stop at large scale. But impostor accounts are still relatively easy to find on Twitter. The Times identified hundreds more of them through Twitter’s own automated “who to follow” feature: When a user views a known impostor account, Twitter routinely recommends other impostor accounts to follow. One real Twitter account, belonging to Jasmine Artis, a health care worker from North Carolina, was cloned dozens of times. At least 75 of those impostor accounts still exist — though some have recently been restricted — each using her picture, her name and a brief bio that refers to the school she was attending when her account was copied. Most of the clones have made only a handful of posts, some in Russian or Japanese. Ms. Artis said she had not been aware of the accounts.  Even Twitter’s “verified” users, many of them well known, are being impersonated. There are active fake accounts impersonating the Democratic senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway and the journalist April D. Ryan. None appeared to be obvious parodies. Instead, each posted content that mimicked what the real account might tweet. Both Facebook and Twitter rely in part on their users to report impostors and abuse. But the companies’ enforcement decisions can seem arbitrary. In January, Antonia Caliboso, a social worker in Seattle, discovered an impostor Facebook account using her name, biographical information and a photo, all lifted from a 2013 news release about a fellowship she had won. Ms. Caliboso and dozens of her friends reported the fake account to Facebook over a period of weeks. But Facebook representatives repeatedly told her the account did not violate the company’s impersonation policies, she said. Eventually, to protect herself, Ms. Caliboso deleted her real account. “I can’t risk that a client or employer — past, present or future — might find that profile,” she said. Last week, Facebook reversed its position: The account was shut down, according to an email Ms. Caliboso received on Feb. 10, “because it goes against our community standard on identity and privacy.” Social media companies succeed in the marketplace by amassing as many active users as possible, so most make it relatively easy to create new accounts. Neither Facebook nor Twitter requires proof of identity to open a new account, but both require it when reporting impostors. Decisions about whether to take down or suspend an account are automated wherever possible, or farmed out to teams of low-level employees and contractors around the world. As a result, on most social media platforms it is far easier to build a bot than to kill one. “The reason that they’re so bad at this is that it conflicts with their business model,” said Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist and technology expert at the University of North Carolina. “They try to come up with one set of rules that applies to two billion people, and then simplify it so that a contractor in a warehouse in the Philippines can go click-click-click and apply the policy.” Ms. Mason, the data scientist, eventually took matters into her own hands. After she filed dozens of impersonation reports to Twitter in 2015, the company suspended many of the impostors, but left dozens untouched. So she created more than 100 bots of her own, using as many variations of her name as she could think of. Each linked back to her real account, with the message “the real hmason is over there.” Eventually, Ms. Mason’s homegrown bots, and Twitter’s own efforts, seemed to overwhelm the impostors, she said, and the surge in fake accounts stopped.  “With Twitter, it was easy” to make bots, Ms. Mason said. “I was shocked by how easy it was.” A version of this article appears in print on February 21, 2018, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: How Lax Enforcement Breeds Impostors Online.

Styles,490,"The most ignorant man in America knows that Donald Trump is president — but that’s about it. Living a liberal fantasy is complicated. Erik Hagerman heads out for his morning ritual, a 30-minute drive into town for coffee and a scone at his favorite coffee shop in Athens, Ohio.CreditDamon Winter/The New York Times Supported by By Sam Dolnick GLOUSTER, Ohio — At first, the experiment didn’t have a name. Right after the election, Erik Hagerman decided he’d take a break from reading about the hoopla of politics. Donald Trump’s victory shook him. Badly. And so Mr. Hagerman developed his own eccentric experiment, one that was part silent protest, part coping mechanism, part extreme self-care plan. He swore that he would avoid learning about anything that happened to America after Nov. 8, 2016. “It was draconian and complete,” he said. “It’s not like I wanted to just steer away from Trump or shift the conversation. It was like I was a vampire and any photon of Trump would turn me to dust.” It was just going to be for a few days. But he is now more than a year into knowing almost nothing about American politics. He has managed to become shockingly uninformed during one of the most eventful chapters in modern American history. He is as ignorant as a contemporary citizen could ever hope to be. James Comey. Russia. Robert Mueller. Las Vegas. The travel ban. “Alternative facts.” Pussy hats. Scaramucci. Parkland. Big nuclear buttons. Roy Moore. He knows none of it. To Mr. Hagerman, life is a spoiler. “I just look at the weather,” said Mr. Hagerman, 53, who lives alone on a pig farm in southeastern Ohio. “But it’s only so diverting.” He says he has gotten used to a feeling that he hasn’t experienced in a long time. “I am bored,” he said. “But it’s not bugging me.” It takes meticulous planning to find boredom. Mr. Hagerman commits as hard as a method actor, and his self-imposed regimen — white-noise tapes at the coffee shop, awkward scolding of friends, a ban on social media — has reshaped much of his life. Extreme as it is, it’s a path that likely holds some appeal for liberals these days — a D.I.Y. version of moving to Canada. Democrats, liberals and leftists have coped with this first year of the Trump presidency in lots of ways. Some subsist on the thin gruel of political cartoon shows and online impeachment petitions. Others dwell online in the thrilling place where conspiracy is indistinguishable from truth. Others have been inspired to action, making their first run for public office, taking local action or marching in their first protest rally. Mr. Hagerman has done the opposite of all of them. The fact that it’s working for him — “I’m emotionally healthier than I’ve ever felt,” he said — has made him question the very value of being fed each day by the media. Why do we bother tracking faraway political developments and distant campaign speeches? What good comes of it? Why do we read all these tweets anyway? “I had been paying attention to the news for decades,” Mr. Hagerman said. “And I never did anything with it.” At some point last year, he decided his experiment needed a name. He considered The Embargo, but it sounded too temporary. The Boycott? It came off a little whiny. Mr. Hagerman has created a fortress around himself. “Tiny little boats of information can be dangerous,” he said. He decided that it would be called The Blockade. For a guy who has gone to great lengths to essentially plug his ears, Mr. Hagerman sure does talk a lot. He is witty and discursive, punctuating his stories with wild-eyed grins, exaggerated grimaces and more than the occasional lost thread. I recently spent two days visiting his farm on the condition that I not bring news from the outside world. As the sun set over his porch, turning the rolling hills pink then purple then blue, he held forth, jumping from English architecture to the local pigs’ eating habits to his mother’s favorite basketball team to the philosophy of Kant. He can go days without seeing another soul. This life is still fairly new. Just a few years ago, he was a corporate executive at Nike (senior director of global digital commerce was his official, unwieldy title) working with teams of engineers to streamline the online shopping experience. Before that, he had worked digital jobs at Walmart and Disney. “I worked 12-, 14-hour days,” he said. “The calendar completely booked.” But three years ago, he decided he had saved enough money to move to a farm, make elliptical sculptures — and, eventually, opt out of the national conversation entirely. He lives alone and has never been married. As for money, a financial adviser in San Francisco manages his investments. Mr. Hagerman says he throws away the quarterly updates without reviewing them. Mr. Hagerman grew up in southeastern Ohio, and after years spent in Brooklyn warehouses, San Francisco tech bubbles and Nike-land in Portland, Ore., the idea of a quiet life became more and more appealing. His mother lives nearby; he sees her a lot since he moved back in 2015. She reluctantly adheres to The Blockade, although they do discuss the Cleveland Cavaliers. Mr. Hagerman begins every day with a 30-minute drive to Athens, the closest city of note, to get a cup of coffee — a triple-shot latte with whole milk. He goes early, before most customers have settled into the oversize chairs to scroll through their phones. To make sure he doesn’t overhear idle chatter, he often listens to white noise through his headphones. (He used to listen to music, “but stray conversation can creep in between songs.”) At Donkey Coffee, everyone knows his order, and they know about The Blockade. “Our baristas know where he’s at so they don’t engage him on topics that would make him uncomfortable,” said Angie Pyle, the coffee shop’s co-owner. Mr. Hagerman has also trained his friends. A close friend from his Nike days, Parinaz Vahabzadeh, didn’t think he was quite serious at first and, in the early days of The Blockade, kept dropping little hints about politics. The new administration compelled her to engage more deeply in politics, not less. She had only recently become a United States citizen, and she was passionate about the immigration debate. She did not let Mr. Hagerman opt out easily. “I was needling him,” she said. And in response, she received, for the first time, a stern text message. “I’m now officially cross with you,” he wrote. “As you know very well I don’t wish to hear about current events. I know you don’t agree with my wishes but I do expect you to respect them.” They now speak on the phone several times a week, but never about the news. “I’ve gotten used to it,” she said. “It’s actually nice to not talk about politics.” Conversations with Mr. Hagerman can have a Rip Van Winkle quality. He spoke several times about his sister, Bonnie, an assistant professor, who lives in, of all places, Charlottesville, Va. While he and I were talking, I looked over at him at every mention of Charlottesville to see if the name of the city, home to perhaps the ugliest weekend of the Trump era to date, made him flinch. “So, do you associate Charlottesville” — I would say the name deliberately and with emphasis — “with anything besides your sister?” He didn’t bite. I think he really didn’t know about the Nazis. Later, he pointed to a house on a hill and said that before the election, the neighbor had decorated his lawn with an effigy of Hillary Clinton behind bars. I wanted to point out that the recently unveiled Mueller indictment found that a Russian troll had paid for a Hillary impersonator at a Florida rally. But I bit my tongue — Mr. Hagerman didn’t know about Mueller, or Russia, or trolls. Last winter, Mr. Hagerman spent several weeks visiting his twin brother, a tech C.E.O., in San Francisco. Strict arrangements had to be made — the Sunday newspaper kept out of sight, the TV switched off, his teenage niece and nephew under special instructions. “The bigger challenge was when we would have friends come over and visit,” said his brother, Kris. “We had to have Erik not be there, or we would give them a heads up that Erik has this news blockade going and we gave them the guidelines. “They were always a little bemused by it. And to some extent a little envious,” he said. “The prospect of just chucking all that for a period of time felt somewhat appealing.” To be fair, Mr. Hagerman has made a few concessions. He reads The New Yorker’s art reviews, but is careful to flip past the illustrated covers, which often double as political commentary. He watches every Cavaliers game, but only on mute. He counts a few boats that have sailed past The Blockade. He saw a picture of Kim Jong-un on a newspaper at the coffee shop, signaling that something was up with North Korea. And he overheard someone saying something about Obamacare, which meant health care was back in the news. His brother alerted him to the Equifax breach for his own protection. “But the blockade has been pretty damn effective,” Mr. Hagerman said. He said that with some pride, but he has the misgivings about disengaging from political life that you have, by now, surely been shouting at him as you read. “The first several months of this thing, I didn’t feel all that great about it,” he said. “It makes me a crappy citizen. It’s the ostrich head-in-the-sand approach to political outcomes you disagree with.” It seems obvious to say, but to avoid current affairs is in some ways a luxury that many people, like, for example, immigrants worried about deportation, cannot afford. “He has the privilege of constructing a world in which very little of what he doesn’t have to deal with gets through,” said his sister, Bonnie Hagerman. “That’s a privilege. We all would like to construct our dream worlds. Erik is just more able to do it than others.” What if, he began to think, he could address his privilege, and the idea of broader good, near to home? He has a master project, one that he thinks about obsessively, that he believes can serve as his contribution to American society. He calls it The Lake. On a recent spookily warm day, Mr. Hagerman clambered up a steep bank of woods, pushing past vines and stepping past fallen logs. Wide-eyed, giddy with excitement, he led the way to a flat stretch of brush where he spread his arms and began talking even faster than usual. “This is where we’ll build a giant barn. It will feel like a cathedral. The cloister will be here,” he said, making reference to Chartres, and Oxford, and the grandeur of medieval cathedrals. About nine months ago, he bought some 45 acres of land on the site of a former strip mine. The property, untouched for decades, has been reclaimed by nature — deer, beavers, salamanders and canopies of majestic trees are thriving. We walked further to the edge of a steep drop-off. Below, a bright blue lake shimmered in the February heat like a secret. He’ll debate as long as you want whether the body of water counts as a lake or a pond. It’s easier if you just agree it’s a lake. “You wouldn’t believe how great it feels to go swimming there,” he said. He added, with almost rapturous glee, that the lake sits in the spot where the mining company dug deepest. Mr. Hagerman sees this land as his life’s work. He plans to restore it, protect it, live on it and then preserve it for the public. “I will never sell this land,” he said.  He wouldn’t put it exactly this way, but he talks about the land in part as penance for the moral cost of his Blockade. He has come to believe that being a news consumer doesn’t enhance society. He also believes that restoring a former coal mine and giving it to the future does. “I see it as a contribution that has civic relevance that aligns with my passions and what I do well,” Mr. Hagerman said. “I’m going to donate it. It’s going to take most of my net worth. That’s what I’m going to spend the rest of my money on.” He has filled an entire room of his house with a 3-D rendering of the property to better envision his plans. He has hired Gary Conley, a local landscape ecologist, to advise on the project. Mr. Conley, a gentle bearded outdoorsman who can speak at length about the preferences of the local amphibians, believes that the land could become something special. Mr. Conley indulges Mr. Hagerman’s fantasies for the land — a walkway modeled on an ancient Mayan ballgame! Land art inspired by “Spiral Jetty”! Windows and concrete blocks, so many blocks! — but Mr. Conley mainly serves as the straight man to inject ecological reality into the plan. Mr. Conley respects The Blockade. After all, the project of The Lake might not exist without it. In those carefree pre-Trump days, Mr. Hagerman would settle into the coffee shop with his newspaper and dig in. But after The Blockade, he could only read the weather — “For elderly men it’s endlessly interesting” — and the real estate listings. It was during one of those long boring mornings, with no news to read, that he found the listing for The Lake. “The first time I saw it, I said, ‘This is it,’” he said.

Business,491," Supported by Artificial intelligence video tools make it relatively easy to put one person’s face on another person’s body with few traces of manipulation. I tried it on myself. What could go wrong?  By Kevin Roose The scene opened on a room with a red sofa, a potted plant and the kind of bland modern art you’d see on a therapist’s wall.  In the room was Michelle Obama, or someone who looked exactly like her. Wearing a low-cut top with a black bra visible underneath, she writhed lustily for the camera and flashed her unmistakable smile. Then, the former first lady’s doppelgänger began to strip. The video, which appeared on the online forum Reddit, was what’s known as a “deepfake” — an ultrarealistic fake video made with artificial intelligence software. It was created using a program called FakeApp, which superimposed Mrs. Obama’s face onto the body of a pornographic film actress. The hybrid was uncanny — if you didn’t know better, you might have thought it was really her. Until recently, realistic computer-generated video was a laborious pursuit available only to big-budget Hollywood productions or cutting-edge researchers. Social media apps like Snapchat include some rudimentary face-morphing technology.  But in recent months, a community of hobbyists has begun experimenting with more powerful tools, including FakeApp — a program that was built by an anonymous developer using open-source software written by Google. FakeApp makes it free and relatively easy to create realistic face swaps and leave few traces of manipulation. Since a version of the app appeared on Reddit in January, it has been downloaded more than 120,000 times, according to its creator. Deepfakes are one of the newest forms of digital media manipulation, and one of the most obviously mischief-prone. It’s not hard to imagine this technology’s being used to smear politicians, create counterfeit revenge porn or frame people for crimes. Lawmakers have already begun to worry about how deepfakes could be used for political sabotage and propaganda.   Even on morally lax sites like Reddit, deepfakes have raised eyebrows. Recently, FakeApp set off a panic after Motherboard, the technology site, reported that people were using it to create pornographic deepfakes of celebrities. Pornhub, Twitter and other sites quickly banned the videos, and Reddit closed a handful of deepfake groups, including one with nearly 100,000 members. Before the Reddit deepfake groups were closed, they hosted a mixture of users trading video-editing tips and showing off their latest forgeries. A post titled “3D face reconstruction for additional angles” sat next to videos with titles like “(Not) Olivia Wilde playing with herself.” Some users on Reddit defended deepfakes and blamed the media for overhyping their potential for harm. Others moved their videos to alternative platforms, rightly anticipating that Reddit would crack down under its rules against nonconsensual pornography. And a few expressed moral qualms about putting the technology into the world.  Then, they kept making more.  The deepfake creator community is now in the internet’s shadows. But while out in the open, it gave an unsettling peek into the future.  “This is turning into an episode of Black Mirror,” wrote one Reddit user. The post raised the ontological questions at the heart of the deepfake debate: Does a naked image of Person A become a naked image of Person B if Person B’s face is superimposed in a seamless and untraceable way? In a broader sense, on the internet, what is the difference between representation and reality?  The user then signed off with a shrug: “Godspeed rebels.” After lurking for several weeks in Reddit’s deepfake community, I decided to see how easy it was to create a (safe for work, nonpornographic) deepfake using my own face. I started by downloading FakeApp and enlisting two technical experts to help me. The first was Mark McKeague, a colleague in The New York Times’s research and development department. The second was a deepfake creator I found through Reddit, who goes by the nickname Derpfakes.  Because of the controversial nature of deepfakes, Derpfakes would not give his or her real name. Derpfakes started posting deepfake videos on YouTube a few weeks ago, specializing in humorous offerings like Nicolas Cage playing Superman. The account has also posted some how-to videos on deepfake creation. What I learned is that making a deepfake isn’t simple. But it’s not rocket science, either. The first step is to find, or rent, a moderately powerful computer. FakeApp uses a suite of machine learning tools called TensorFlow, which was developed by Google’s A.I. division and released to the public in 2015. The software teaches itself to perform image-recognition tasks through trial and error. The more processing power on hand, the faster it works. To get more speed, Mark and I used a remote server rented through Google Cloud Platform. It provided enough processing power to cut the time frame down to hours, rather than the days or weeks it might take on my laptop. Once Mark set up the remote server and loaded FakeApp on it, we were on to the next step: data collection. Picking the right source data is crucial. Short video clips are easier to manipulate than long clips, and scenes shot at a single angle produce better results than scenes with multiple angles. Genetics also help. The more the faces resemble each other, the better.  I’m a brown-haired white man with a short beard, so Mark and I decided to try several other brown-haired, stubbled white guys. We started with Ryan Gosling. (Aim high, right?) I also sent Derpfakes, my outsourced Reddit expert, several video options to choose from. Next, we took several hundred photos of my face, and gathered images of Mr. Gosling’s face using a clip from a recent TV appearance. FakeApp uses these images to train the deep learning model and teach it to emulate our facial expressions.   To get the broadest photo set possible, I twisted my head at different angles, making as many different faces as I could. Mark then used a program to crop those images down, isolating just our faces, and manually deleted any blurred or badly cropped photos. He then fed the frames into FakeApp. In all, we used 417 photos of me, and 1,113 of Mr. Gosling. When the images were ready, Mark pressed “start” on FakeApp, and the training began. His computer screen filled with images of my face and Mr. Gosling’s face, as the program tried to identify patterns and similarities.  About eight hours later, after our model had been sufficiently trained, Mark used FakeApp to finish putting my face on Mr. Gosling’s body. The video was blurry and bizarre, and Mr. Gosling’s face occasionally flickered into view. Only the legally blind would mistake the person in the video for me.  We did better with a clip of Chris Pratt, the scruffy star of “Jurassic World,” whose face shape is a little more similar to mine. For this test, Mark used a bigger data set — 1,861 photos of me, 1,023 of him — and let the model run overnight.  A few days later, Derpfakes, who had also been training a model, sent me a finished deepfake  made using the footage I had sent and a video of the actor Jake Gyllenhaal. This one was much more lifelike, a true hybrid that mixed my facial features with his hair, beard and body. Derpfakes repeated the process with videos of Jimmy Kimmel and Liev Schreiber, both of which turned out well. As an experienced deepfake creator, Derpfakes had a more intuitive sense of which source videos would produce a clean result, and more experience with the subtle blending and tweaking that takes place at the end of the deepfake process. In all, our deepfake experiment took three days and cost $85.96 in Google Cloud Platform credits. That seemed like a small price to pay for stardom. After the experiment, I reached out to the anonymous creator of FakeApp through an email address on its website. I wanted to know how it felt to create a cutting-edge A.I. tool, only to have it gleefully co-opted by ethically challenged pornographers. A man wrote back, identifying himself as a software developer in Maryland. Like Derpfakes, the man would not give me his full name, and instead went by his first initial, N. He said he had created FakeApp as a creative experiment and was chagrined to see Reddit’s deepfake community use it for ill.  “I joined the community based around these algorithms when it was very small (less than 500 people),” he wrote, “and as soon as I saw the results I knew this was brilliant tech that should be accessible to anyone who wants to play around with it. I figured I’d take a shot at putting together an easy-to-use package to accomplish that.” N. said he didn’t support the use of FakeApp to create nonconsensual pornography or other abusive content. And he said he agreed with Reddit’s decision to ban explicit deepfakes. But he defended the product. “I’ve given it a lot of thought,” he said, “and ultimately I’ve decided I don’t think it’s right to condemn the technology itself — which can of course be used for many purposes, good and bad.” FakeApp is somewhat finicky and hard to use, but it’s easy to imagine it improving quickly. N. said that in the future, FakeApp could be used by all kinds of people to bring high-budget special effects to their personal projects. Deep learning algorithms, he added, were going to be important in the future, not only as stand-alone apps but as powerful components of many tech products. “It’s precisely the things that make them so powerful and useful that make them so scary,” he said. “There’s really no limit to what you can apply it to with a little imagination.” On the day of the school shooting last month in Parkland, Fla., a screenshot of a BuzzFeed News article, “Why We Need to Take Away White People’s Guns Now More Than Ever,” written by a reporter named Richie Horowitz, began making the rounds on social media. The whole thing was fake. No BuzzFeed employee named Richie Horowitz exists, and no article with that title was ever published on the site. But the doctored image pulsed through right-wing outrage channels and was boosted by activists on Twitter. It wasn’t an A.I.-generated deepfake, or even a particularly sophisticated Photoshop job, but it did the trick. Online misinformation, no matter how sleekly produced, spreads through a familiar process once it enters our social distribution channels. The hoax gets 50,000 shares, and the debunking an hour later gets 200. The carnival barker gets an algorithmic boost on services like Facebook and YouTube, while the expert screams into the void. There’s no reason to believe that deepfake videos will operate any differently. People will share them when they’re ideologically convenient and dismiss them when they’re not. The dupes who fall for satirical stories from The Onion will be fooled by deepfakes, and the scrupulous people who care about the truth will find ways to detect and debunk them.  “There’s no choice,” said Hao Li, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Southern California. Mr. Li, who is also the founder of Pinscreen, a company that uses artificial intelligence to create lifelike 3-D avatars, said the weaponization of A.I. was inevitable and would require a sudden shift in public awareness. “I see this as the next form of communication,” he said. “I worry that people will use it to blackmail others, or do bad things. You have to educate people that this is possible.” So, O.K. Here I am, telling you this: An A.I. program powerful enough to turn Michelle Obama into a pornography star, or transform a schlubby newspaper columnist into Jake Gyllenhaal, is in our midst. Manipulated video will soon become far more commonplace. And there’s probably nothing we can do except try to bat the fakes down as they happen, pressure social media companies to fight misinformation aggressively, and trust our eyes a little less every day.

Arts&Leisure,492,"A heart attack. A legacy with a question mark. Now Mr. Banderas has a dream role he’s wanted since childhood: Picasso, in NatGeo’s “Genius.” By TAFFY BRODESSER-AKNERAPRIL 18, 2018 ETYEK, Hungary — By the time Antonio Banderas shaved off his eyebrows and hair to play Pablo Picasso — his lifelong hero, his towering standard of greatness — he had already been asked to portray Picasso twice. “Oh, yes,” he said. “Twice before.” He sat in a director’s chair, his face contorted into [thoughtful emoji], complete with chin strokes. On his nose, cheeks and chin, he wore silicone prosthetics for the ways he did not resemble Picasso: to thin out his featherbed lips, to make his nose fleshier and his jowls jowlier, to mask his beautiful face. It didn’t work. The minute you looked at him, his chocolate pudding swimming pool eyeballs gave him away. It was his last day here before heading to Malta for the final leg of shooting for National Geographic’s “Genius,” an anthology series that focuses on Picasso in its second season and has its premiere on April 24. The Picasso he was playing today was 67. When he was shooting, he assumed the posture of a 67-year-old, but when he wasn’t, he was Antonio Banderas, a human exclamation point, his face an orchestra of intense expressions: [extremely happy emoji], [crying-laughing emoji], [despondent emoji]. (A better way to put it: His friend Salma Hayek told me that out of all the characters he’s ever played, he most resembles Puss in Boots in real life.) Oh yes, by the time he shaved off all vestiges of hair above his neck, he already had a long, full career. He already was a star of great renown in Spain, where he had served as a muse to Pedro Almodóvar for seven movies. He already received accolades for his performance in 1992’s “The Mambo Kings,” a performance so openhearted and passionate that few noticed that his only English at the time was in the form of phonetic imitation. He had already wooed American audiences with his intimate portrayal of Tom Hanks’s lover in “Philadelphia.” He had helped Robert Rodriguez, another director who loved him, achieve American acclaim via “Desperado” and the “Spy Kids” movies. He’d swashbuckled his way into children’s hearts as a sultry, shod cat in the “Shrek” spinoff, “Puss in Boots.” He had directed two movies. He had serenaded in “Evita;” simulated French-kissing with Catherine Zeta-Jones through two of the most alive iterations of “Zorro” we’d ever seen. He’d seduced his way to a Tony nomination for an energetic “Nine.” He had Angelina Jolie’ed with Angelina Jolie in “Original Sin.”  He was a beloved fixture in American cinema — a masked avenger, a Latin lover, a mariachi, a matador, an assassin posing as, oh yes, a mariachi. He bided his time in masks, with guns, with swords, and as he grew older, he was rewarded with the chance to play (or almost play, in projects that got killed) historical figures: Dalí, Mussolini, Pancho Villa, and Picasso — and Picasso. And now it was finally happening. He was going to play his boyhood hero and bring pride to Málaga, Spain — both his and Picasso’s hometown. When Mr. Banderas was growing up, his mother would stop in front of the house the artist was born in every time they passed it and say, “Look, Antonio.” Now, in the home he owns in Málaga, he can see that house from his terrace. All this, and still, when Mr. Banderas sat down in a director’s chair next to me, after I congratulated him on what must be a significant lifetime achievement, he shook his head and said I had it wrong. Sure, it’s great, this work is great. But it’s not the ultimate. Not yet. “Oh no,” he said, leaning in close. “I still don’t think I have done the thing I will be remembered for.”IN BETWEEN dropping existential depth bombs, Mr. Banderas told stories. He stood with his legs spread apart, his head thrown back and his arms raised to the side and said that Salvador Dalí liked to put honey on his lips after a meal so that flies would gather and crawl all over his face. “He found it to be an erotic experience,” Mr. Banderas said, as he closed his eyes and played piano fingers over his lips to imitate the flies. Did you know that Dalí (allegedly) hated blind people? He thought they were faking. “He would cross the street to yell at a man walking around like …” He felt around with an imaginary cane and laughed. “Ay, was he crazy.”  He was dressed for the day’s scenes in a tank top under a silk button down shirt and trousers hiked up to around his fourth rib, a particular kind of European old-man fashion. He wore over his bald head a sparse, netted, gray wig, since Picasso had Dr. Phil-pattern baldness and Mr. Banderas still has a full head of hair. He could have worn one of those rubber caps, but if you think he would, you don’t know Mr. Banderas. He would never do that. He would never not take the opportunity to become even closer to the character. He considered Picasso, really considered him. They started out so similar, but it’s easy to confuse details of birth with the way a man turns out. Take their treatment of women, for example. Ms. Hayek said that Mr. Banderas is such a good friend that when he read her essay in The New York Times about being harassed by Harvey Weinstein, he was among the first to call her. He wanted to know why she didn’t tell him what Mr. Weinstein was doing back when Mr. Banderas was making a cameo in her movie “Frida.” He was the first person to call the minute she was nominated for an Oscar for the role. Picasso, on the other hand, said that “Women are machines for suffering” and that to him, they were either “goddesses or doormats.” “Genius: Picasso” addresses Picasso’s misogyny as much as his art. In the first episode a woman is home with his offspring while he makes out with another lover on the beach, and both women get in a fistfight in front of him while he is painting “Guernica.” Honestly, I told him, the lionization of a man who treated women this way is gross to me. Mr. Banderas beseeched me to be more generous. “The problem with Picasso from my point of view, I don’t think he abused women, as we understand that now,” he said. “The problem is that he wanted everything, everything, all the time.” He enters a project with maximum dedication, maximum research. The more you know about a character, the more you can fill the white spaces with something rich. He asks: Do you know that Picasso’s grandson Pablito apparently stood on a street near his home in France with a sandwich board when his grandfather wouldn’t allow him to visit him in the final days? Go ahead, ask him anything. If you know your subject down to his soul, then the subject is there when you need him. “I’ve been with him now for months every day and I can just actually say, ‘O.K., come over here.’ The ghost comes and just gets in your body and you’re ‘boom.’” On the days it doesn’t come so easily, you can fill the white space with you. Who is to say where Picasso ends and Mr. Banderas begins? Who can give that information now that he’s prepared for this role three separate times? Kenneth Biller, a creator of the show, and Ron Howard, an executive producer, immediately thought of Mr. Banderas for the role. They worried that they’d have to convince him to play the part, but he jumped up (pop!) and agreed to do it. He had recently happened upon the first season of “Genius,” with Geoffrey Rush as Albert Einstein, while cruising on his Apple TV. He watched the whole thing in two days.  “Genius: Picasso,” which takes place over 10 episodes, is shot during two eras: Picasso’s youth, and his old age. In his younger days, he is played by Alex Rich, who does a Picasso impression that is actually an Antonio Banderas impression. The camera follows Mr. Rich to show the freneticism of youth. But during the old age scenes, the camera stays still, like a portrait with Mr. Banderas entering and leaving it. In those scenes, it’s Mr. Banderas who supplies the energy. How wonderful. How wonderful to find in your late 50s a character that’s been so meaningful. You can maybe understand that after all the years of masks and tangos and needing to drip with Andalusian lust, it’s nice to play someone who is considered a genius. Oh yes, it is nice to finally play someone who has touched greatness. HAD MR. BANDERAS stayed in Spain, this would have been an entirely different story. He would have continued on the path Mr. Almodóvar had set for him, playing men with depth and inner lives. But he didn’t — he couldn’t. He grew up going to the theater with his parents: plays by Lope de Vega, Pedro Calderón de la Barca. He marveled at theater as an act of civilization. “It was so beautiful,” he said. “We are all here and we have an agreement. We’re going to sit down here and you’re going to tell me a story and you have to make me believe it. And I thought, ‘This is [expletive] magical.’” He wanted to be on the other side of the theater. He wanted to be onstage. But his parents had seen how artists were treated under the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco. Many were exiled. His mother was distraught. “Don’t be an actor,” she pleaded. “Be something dignified.” He thought maybe he’d be a soccer player instead. Then in 1976, the year after Franco died, an American theater company came through Málaga with “Hair” and it was just over for Mr. Banderas. “Oh, my God. What is this? What is this beard and this long hair and this freedom?,” he remembered thinking. He told his parents, “I have to do this. I have to do this type of theater. This is theater that is revolutionary.” In 1981, while sitting at Café Gijón in Madrid, a man with a red briefcase held court telling funny stories. Mr. Banderas had long hair and a mustache for a role in a play. The man looked at him and said: “You should do film cinema. You are very romantic and you have a romantic face.” Mr. Banderas said, “O.K. Cool.” Afterward, he asked other patrons if anyone knew who the man was. “They said to me: ‘He’s called Pedro Almodóvar. He made one movie’” — he had, in fact, already made two feature films and several shorts — “‘but he’s not going to make any more.’” Two days later, Mr. Almodóvar came to see Mr. Banderas in the play. In the dressing room afterward, he asked Mr. Banderas if he wanted to do a movie with him. “Sure,” Mr. Banderas said. Their first movie was the 1982 comedy “Labyrinth of Passion,” in which he plays a terrorist.  They made six more movies together. He played complex, brooding men — people with souls. In Spain, for Mr. Almodóvar, the soul was inherent in the character. Later, in the United States, working for American directors, Mr. Banderas had to create his characters’ souls. He had a choice. He could go back to Spain and work with great directors — the star system there revolves around auteurs, not actors — and there was no shortage of deep, complex roles for him. His fellow Hispanic actors asked him, “So, are you going to stay in America?” He told them, “Well, I don’t know. Maybe. Yeah.” They told him, “Well, if you stay here you’re going to be the bad guy, number one.” They told him he would only ever get cast as a member of a cartel or a gang. But it was too late. By 1996, he was married to Melanie Griffith. They had a daughter, Stella. He had grown attached to his stepchildren. The question became one not of artistic fulfillment but of practicality. “How can I keep my career here? I’m married here. I live here. I have to play here.” And he loved America. “The culture here.” He shimmered with delight. “There is something very beautiful about America, very innocent. Oh, yes. It’s still new. It’s innocent.” I expressed some surprise. Over the course of my time in Hungary with him, we’d gotten word of the mass school shooting in Parkland, Fla. America had become horrifying to me. “Yes,” he said. “But you guys believe. You believe everything — even in this moment you believe.” In Europe, he said, people are skeptical. There’s the weight of history. But America, man. “I love NASA. I love those institutions. And I remember visiting Houston and going there and me doing my eyes like this.” He made his eyes big and full of disbelief. And the innovation! “These people that invent Googles and Apples and all these companies, they put heart in the skies. Elon Musk doing this thing is unbelievable to me.” So he played what he called the “exotic guy.” His agent told him he’d become more powerful the more he said no. “But,” he would say. “I have a problem here because I have to build a career almost handicapped.” He knew he was offered jobs that weren’t quite the best, jobs that had been offered to five or 10 actors before him.  “I cannot play in the same league as certain American actors because my accent didn’t allow me just to play a banker from New York or an astronaut,” he said. “So I have to be balancing. And it’s almost like the guy in the circus that tried to keep all the plates going. And if he stops they fall. And so I did have to do in my career things that I wouldn’t have done, yes.” What could he do? “It was a desert for Spanish actors.” But lately, a strange thing started happening. He’s not being asked to wear matador outfits anymore. At the ripe (but still extremely handsome) age of 57, the roles got better. “They have more weight, they are more complex, they are more profound and I enjoy more to play them because you can just actually find many different ways to play,” he said. “It’s almost like a pot and you can’t stop putting things in. Before it was a uniform almost. They wanted the heroic, the epic, the guy.” Maybe it’s the Hispanic population coming of age, he wondered. Great numbers with advanced degrees and a real presence in cinema. “Now it’s normal to see at the Academy Awards Mexican directors taking Oscars, Spanish actors, actors from Puerto Rico.” But it could also be him. It could also be that there’s something about transforming small caricatures into great, big, memorable characters. All that time working to stay in business — as opposed to working to keep up an image — paid off. He subverted America’s attempts to objectify him. He took artistic risks. He became adept at infusing soul into one-note characters (I’m talking what could have been a throwaway role in “Miami Rhapsody;” I’m talking the Nasonex bee.) That’s the thing about Picasso: He was considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th century and he was also prolific. He wasn’t cheap with his talents. He didn’t think that to practice his art would be to drain the supply of his artistry. He knew that was not how greatness works. AT THE END of the day, Mr. Banderas sat in the makeup trailer as a woman applied glue remover to his head with a paintbrush, then pulled at the netting that hosted the white hair he’d been wearing. She did the same for his eyebrows, where there was a shadow of stubble. They began to work their fingers at the silicone that covered his face. He liked to help free himself from it. Get the most out of your screen time with movie and TV recommendations, news and commentary from New York Times experts.     Mr. Banderas lives in England now, in Surrey, about an hour southwest of London. He lives there with his girlfriend, Nicole Kimpel, an investment adviser he met at Cannes a few years ago. The truth is, he doesn’t need to be in America anymore. So many movie shoots are done in Europe now for tax reasons. And Ms. Kimpel has an identical twin sister who lives in Switzerland whom she can’t bear to be too far away from.  What did he need to stay in the United States for anyway? His days of co-parenting are over. Stella is off at the University of Southern California, studying cinema. Of his divorce from Ms. Griffith in 2015 he says: “Melanie is a very generous woman and an excellent mother and a great lover for many years. But there is a moment that things were not working and before we started damaging each other we just decided to take that option.” Here’s the truth about why Antonio Banderas stayed in the States for so long. Yes, he got married. Yes, he loved NASA and the Googles. Yes, he loved our innocence. But you know what else? He won’t say it, almost out of fealty to the country he was born in, but Ms. Hayek and Mr. Rodriguez will. In Spain, Ms. Hayek said, “He could not do some of the action movies. He’d never been on Broadway.” In Spain he could do a lot of interesting work. But in the U.S., he can be an action star, a comedy hero, a Nasonex bee, a spy dad. In Spain he could be in the theater, yes, but in America, he can be on Broadway. That year he was in “Nine?” Mr. Banderas said it was his happiest time in America. That’s who Antonio Banderas is. “He’s someone who wants to eat the world,” Mr. Rodriguez told me. You can’t just eat the world from Europe, though. That’s the thing about being an actor in America. When you’re famous here, you’re famous everywhere. Mr. Banderas stayed here because Spain simply wasn’t big enough for him. In Hungary, sitting in his makeup chair in the set of “Picasso,” Mr. Banderas said, “It’s hard to look into the mirror and see a doddering old man.” He didn’t take his eyes off himself when he spoke. “Picasso is 67 here. I’m two-and-a-half years away from 60. It’s not so far away.” He tilted his head, evaluating his cheek. “It’s scary to visit an age before you get there. But it’s somehow even scarier when it’s not that far away.” About a year ago, Mr. Banderas was preparing breakfast in his home when his arm began to hurt. He’d had an arrhythmia issue for years, and one of his doctors in Los Angeles had told him he had a blockage in one of his arteries. He’d been under a lot of stress recently — the divorce, the move. He filmed seven movies that year. He was smoking. The pain in his arm was faint, but suddenly he felt it in his jaw. That’s when he knew: He was having a heart attack. He was in the hospital for just a day. As the nurse, who was a fan, said goodbye to him, she said: “Antonio, you’re going to be very sad. For like a month or two months you’ll be very sad because the hearts hold feelings. And you’re going to feel like the world is crumbling around you. Don’t worry because you can put it back where it was and be the happy person that you are and continue doing your work.”  He didn’t think much of it, but as he recuperated, he found that he couldn’t shake his sadness. It engulfed him. It was like nothing he’d ever felt before. “Suddenly, you discover at your root level that it can be like in a second you can say goodbye.” But he’s Antonio Banderas, so eventually the sadness made way for a different feeling: inspiration. He was still here. He was still here and he had so much left to do. The first script he read after his heart attack was “Life Itself,” written and directed by Dan Fogelman (“This Is Us”). Mr. Banderas read to the last page and he knew he’d found his next project, a drama about intersecting lives in Spain and America. He was offered the role of a “normal” character — not a historical figure, not a masked avenger, not a slutty cat. Just a real man. During filming, he was different than usual. “I was not so anxious about what is going to be the result of this, what is going to be their opinions. No, it was about me. It was — well, it’s very genuine because actually I love this profession. What about that? I love this profession.” After that, “things magically start happening. Picasso came walking into my life.” The silicone was now gone from his face. The hair was, too. He looked like a beautiful egg. Every day when the makeup came off, he was relieved to see that he was still there underneath. It’s scary to get old. Maybe it’s even scarier because you still have all the energy in the world, I suggested, and you feel like you haven’t done the thing you’ll be remembered for yet. He smiled. I took him too literally, he said. It’s not that he doesn’t think he’ll be remembered for what he’s already done. It’s just that … Did he tell me the story yet about what Dalí supposedly used to say? “He used to say, ‘I am a very mediocre painter for the reason that I don’t want to die. In fact, I am the best painter in the world but I don’t paint a good painting because if I paint a good painting I will die the next day. So I prefer to be mediocre.’” He gave me a combination [laughing with mouth open emoji] and [eyerolling emoji]. Ay, was Dalí crazy. Didn’t he know? Dignity comes when it’s required. Didn’t he know? Greatness only gets greater the more it’s practiced. Oh yes. That’s how greatness works.

Magazine,493,"He has been president for more than a year — so why is he still holding rallies? By CHARLES HOMANSAPRIL 9, 2018 It was in the last half-hour of Donald Trump’s speech in Moon Township, Pa., that a sense of what exactly it was that I was watching — what I and everyone else had been watching throughout Trump’s presidency to that point — finally clicked into place with startling clarity. This was in early March, in an unexpectedly pristine hangar by the Pittsburgh airport, its white floor buffed to a shine in which I could make out my reflection. The implicit purpose of the event was to bring some Trump magic to a fellow Republican’s faltering campaign. Moon Township is in Pennsylvania’s 18th District, which Trump won in 2016 by nearly 20 points and where in three days, the Republican state representative Rick Saccone would narrowly lose a special congressional election to Conor Lamb, a Democrat who had never run for office. Saccone took the stage briefly before Trump did, and his people were circulating in the hangar: normal-looking suburban Republican operatives and volunteers of the sort who are still jarring to see attached to the Trump roadshow, like insurance-claims adjusters piled into the bed of a monster truck. But this was a Trump event in spirit: the email advisory from Donald J. Trump for President Inc., his official presidential campaign committee, described it as a “campaign rally” but did not mention Saccone, explaining instead that Trump would “highlight the benefits that his historic tax cuts are providing hard-working families across Pennsylvania and to celebrate our booming economy now that America is once again open for business.” Onstage, Trump seemed to intermittently remember the tax cuts and the booming economy, and even more intermittently that he was supposed to be promoting the candidate, whom he had reportedly derided in private as “weak.” But he mostly did what he usually does at his rallies: recite the latest verse of the ballad of Donald Trump, the president who would be doing great things for the people in this room were it not for his many antagonists. This evening, he was talking about Peggy Noonan, the conservative Wall Street Journal columnist. (“She’s a Bushie!” an older man next to me yelled scornfully.) Noonan had apparently written something, or (more likely) said something on cable news, where she appears often as a pearl-necklaced avatar of political normalcy, about Trump’s appearing inadequately presidential. “I’m very presidential!” Trump told us, with mock indignation. Then he stiffened in his suit and adopted a stentorian tone, like a fourth grader doing an impression of his school principal. “Laaaadies and gentlemen,” he intoned, “thank you for being here tonight. Rick Saccone will be a great, great congressman. He will help me very much. He’s a fine man, and Yong is a wonderful wife. I just want to tell you on behalf of the United States of America that we appreciate your service. And to all of the military out there, we respect you very much. Thank you. Thank you.” He broke character for a second: “And then you go, ‘God bless you, and God bless the United States of America, thank you very much.’ ” He turned and faced the V.I.P. guests in the riser behind him, and did a sort of rigid penguin walk. The crowd whooped and laughed — not the cruel laughter you come to know at Trump rallies but real belly laughter, for what was a genuinely funny bit. Trump, who loves nothing more than being loved, kept penguin-walking, and everyone kept laughing. It took a few more seconds for the spectacular strangeness of the moment to settle in: We were watching a sitting American president imitating an American president.  The president in Trump’s impression was an authority figure experienced at Olympian, inhuman remove. All of us in the hangar, Trump included, were accustomed to the presence of this person: to admiring or lampooning him, loving or hating him, but always having him there. Except now, he wasn’t. Watching Trump step into the archetype momentarily and then just as quickly step out, it hit me: Even in Trump’s mind, that president was someone else, somewhere else. It was as if I were sitting on a commercial flight, at cruising altitude, when the pilot suddenly plopped down in the next seat, commiserated about the tarmac delays and poor in-flight service, then popped an Ambien and went to sleep. There is a widely held theory that Donald Trump did not, and maybe still does not, really want to be president. Whether or not this is true, what can be ventured with greater certainty is that no candidate has ever delighted as visibly as Trump did in campaigning to be president, and that his having been elected was the period at the end of a sentence that he would happily have let run on forever. For Trump, the campaign trail was a place of self-actualization. On the stage was where he seemed most himself — so much so that, not even a full day after his election, the president-elect mused to his staff about the possibility of another series of rallies.  A weekend tour, he was thinking then: an encore. The more pressing realities of the presidential transition quickly asserted themselves, but a week later, George Gigicos, the advance-team director for Trump’s campaign, told a reporter at Trump Tower that plans were indeed in motion for a “victory tour,” as he described it. “It will happen in the next couple of weeks,” Gigicos said; Trump would go “obviously to the states that we won and the swing states we flipped over.” By the time the first dates of the tour were announced, on Nov. 29, it had been tactfully rechristened a “thank-you tour”: nine rallies in nine states throughout December. “I was with the advance team yesterday, and they’re showing me all the different places he’s going in the next two weeks,” Anthony Scaramucci, at the time a member of the executive committee of Trump’s transition team, told the Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo. “This is a guy who doesn’t give up.” He didn’t: After taking a few weeks in January and February to be inaugurated and acquaint himself with the business of running the country, Trump held another rally. He has been holding them regularly ever since, sometimes as often as twice a month. His itinerary has not once diverged from the states on his electoral map; he had been to the exact same hangar in Moon two days before winning Pennsylvania in 2016. There have been 20 rallies in all, give or take a couple that might be construed as more conventional presidential appearances — though it is hard for even these to not take on the character of a Trump rally when he takes the stage. They amount to one of the few sustained, continuous projects of his presidency, and represent a genuinely novel contribution to the theater of American politics: a “Basement Tapes” of the Trump years, a never-ending tour with stakes perpetually hazy and unclear. From the beginning, I thought it would be important to witness these rallies, and I went as often as I could. Whenever I did, I was confronted with the question of what it was, precisely, that I expected to witness. Was it the people who turned out to see him? I was curious, at first, who they would be — who would show up for what were, in effect, campaign rallies for a campaign that ended months ago. I interviewed them, diligently filling notebooks: I walked in here, somebody told me to [expletive] off. I’m a Nazi ’cause I’m going in here. This guy outside, he says, ‘Nazis should die!’ O.K., I’m with you! I’m on the same side! I’m not a [expletive] Nazi! I think he almost destroyed the country, Obama did. He bragged when he got out of office that he turned this country a little more brown. Was that his job? Turning the country brown? I heard it on TV. But according to the left, anybody that wants Trump is a racist. I liked everybody but Trump and Ted Cruz. But because he was our nominee, I voted for him. I’ve warmed up to him. I just wish he would, uh, calm it down a little bit? With the tweeting? But you’ve read all this before, haven’t you? The spectrum of people at these rallies was not appreciably different from the spectrum at Trump’s actual campaign rallies, which was itself fairly representative of the broader rallygoing Republican electorate in 2016 — and interviewing people at campaign events, as every reporter believes secretly but is not allowed to admit, is almost always a waste of time for everyone involved in the exchange, like asking Mets fans at a Mets game why they like the Mets. These rallies rarely produced news, and what news they produced was usually limited to something Trump said, which meant you could just as easily cover it from the comfort of your own couch, thanks to the handful of live-broadcasting TV crews that was always packed onto a riser in the back of the venue. These people served double duty as a hate totem for the events, the most reliable targets for ritual humiliation from the stage. Huddled around their tripods, buffeted by thousands of boos and obscenities, they called to mind weathercasters lashed to telephone poles, early-Dan Rather-style, in a hurricane. Their footage, chopped up and YouTubed and GIFed and John Olivered, would be injected into the infinitely subdividing capillaries of social-media outrage in near real time. Sometimes at the rallies, I would look at these camera crews and then open Twitter on my phone, watch it welling up with cascades of disbelief at whichever deliberately disbelief-inducing thing Trump had just said, and wonder what the point of any of us being there was. But there was something about these rallies that you couldn’t see from your couch. I have never interviewed Trump, but people I know who have often remark on an uncanny element of the experience: the absence of any indication of an off-limits private self distinct from his public image. The phenomenon feels radically postmodern: a complete communion of the thing with its representation, officiated by an audience of millions over the course of nearly four decades. The tens of thousands of people who came to see him speak at campaign events might have numbered well below the millions who had watched him on TV, but the sheer physical fact of them — he would talk endlessly at his rallies about the lines trying to get inside the building, the poor put-upon fire marshals who had to deliver the bad news — seemed to entrance him. During the general election, Trump once called a reporter I know excitedly from the air as he descended to an event, and told him to turn on cable news; he was looking down at the rally and marveling at the size of the crowd. “Celebrity is a mask that eats into the face,” John Updike once wrote — but with Trump, it was hard to imagine the face ever having been there at all. Only a man like this could conceive of a permanent campaign, extending infinitely after Election Day, as something desirable. From the first, the postelection rallies were bemoaned as, at best, a waste of presidential time, but this missed their peculiar intimacy. To feel as if you were witnessing something essential and true about Barack Obama, you would have had to see him alone in his study late at night. To witness the same of Trump, you have to stand among thousands gathered to see him — and see him seeing you seeing him. “You!” Trump said, pointing to a man in the crowd. “I just saw him on television — he said: ‘I love Trump! Let Trump do what he has to do!’ ”  This was in Melbourne, Fla., last February — Trump’s first rally after taking office. He was in Mar-a-Lago mode, open-collared and visibly at ease, more so than he had been at any point since Inauguration Day. Five days earlier, Michael Flynn, his national security adviser, had resigned over Flynn’s contacts with Russian officials, and Trump had asked the F.B.I. director, James Comey, to stop investigating him. One of the largest single-day demonstrations in American history had been staged in protest of Trump — less as a president than as a human being — dwarfing his own inauguration’s attendance. His travel ban was gummed up in federal court. But this wasn’t Washington, or the Fourth Circuit; it was Florida, “my second home,” as Trump had described it. “Come here — let him up, I’m not worried about him,” he said as the man made his way to the stage. “Hop over the fence! He can do it — look, this guy’s in great shape. This guy is great — don’t worry about him.” The man’s name, it would later be ascertained, was Gene Huber. He was a car salesman from Boynton Beach, very tan, with a close-cropped corona of graying hair, in good shape just as the president said, wearing a commemorative T-shirt from Trump’s inauguration featuring the same presidential seal as the lectern behind which he now embraced Trump in a bear hug. “This guy! He’s been all over television, saying the best things,” Trump said. “Say a couple words.” “Mr. President, thank you, sir!” Huber said, slightly wild-eyed with adrenaline, looking not at Trump but at the cameras. “We the people, our movement, is the reason why our president of the United States is standing in front of us today. When President Trump, during the election, promised all these things he was going to do for us, I knew he was going to do this for us.” Huber yielded the microphone and exited the stage. “A star is born, a star is born,” Trump said. “I wouldn’t say that Secret Service was thrilled with that, but we know our people, right? We know our people. A great guy — and so many others, I see some others, they’re being interviewed. The media will give them no credit.” He shook his head at the treatment of this man, who had been rendered real to Trump by his appearance on television, whom the media would diligently and regularly interview henceforth, when they recognized him at the subsequent rallies that Huber religiously attended after quitting his car business post-Melbourne to dedicate himself full time to supporting the president, a cardboard cutout of whom, Huber told CNN, he kept at home and saluted every day. Like Trump himself, Huber was now famous for being famous, and in June reporters found him camped out in line the night before Trump’s rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, wearing a T-shirt printed with a photograph of himself hugging Trump on the stage in Melbourne, beneath the words WE THE PEOPLE. “It is great to be back in the incredible, beautiful, great state of Iowa!” Trump said, as he took the stage in Cedar Rapids the following evening. “Home of the greatest wrestlers in the world, including our friend Dan Gable — some of the great, great wrestlers of the world, right? We love those wrestlers.” It was five months into his presidency by then, and five rallies. In Nashville in March, Trump railed against the judge in Hawaii who issued an injunction against his revised travel ban — “This ruling makes us look weak!” — and against his own staff, which had advised him to revise it in the first place. Five days later, the same day James Comey was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee about Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump was at another rally, this time in Louisville, Ky., talking about Colin Kaepernick: “There was an article today that reported that N.F.L. owners don’t want to pick him up because they don’t want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump!” The rallies had ceased to be the curiosity they were at first. Out of basic psychological necessity, if nothing else, the country was learning to metabolize the Trump presidency’s daily news barrage, of which the rallies were but one minor component, another assaultive stream of words and images entering the public consciousness in a disembodied, decontextualized way: Here was Trump, shouting somewhere. At the events, you would be reminded, with some surprise, that these moments occurred at fixed coordinates in space and time, as opposed to simply materializing in the news cycle in which the country was now trapped, 24 hours a day, by virtue of Trump’s own unwavering attention to it.      By the time Trump got to Cedar Rapids, the rallies had acquired an informal template. There was an often agreeably random opening (wrestlers?), some pleasantries (in Iowa, shout-outs to Karen Handel, who had just beaten Jon Ossoff in a special congressional election in Georgia, and Steve Scalise, who had just been shot at a softball game), a brief tour through the headlines (North Korea). Then Trump would begin reciting what sounded like a conventional prepared speech, only to immediately digress from it: “Here are just some of the historic accomplishments we have achieved in just a very short period of time — and I have to just preface it by saying — thank you, darling — I have to preface it by saying, you know, I’ve been watching, they’re saying” — his voice deepening into an impression of an anchorman’s scold — “ ‘President Trump has not produced health care.’ You know,” he said, leaning in with a conspiratorial, can-you-believe-these-guys? look, “I’ve been there for five months! If you remember, during the Clinton period, they worked for years and years and years and never got health care. Obama” — here there were boos, and Trump paused briefly to enjoy them — “though after listening to that testimony, I fully understand. But President Obama, his whole administration, pushing, pushing for Obamacare, which has now failed. In fact, I was just told by your great governor, and ex-governor, that your insurance companies have all fled the state of Iowa.” The texture of this was familiar to anyone who watched Trump during the campaign. The conventional speech was there, nominally, a formal structure around which Trump improvised, embroidering it with anecdotes that may or may not have happened, turning over parts of the speech in the light and opening up the back end of it to show the audience, to let them in on the secrets, to convey a sense that he was leveling with the people who had the good sense to be there at that moment, offering a sensation of truth if not always the complete thing (Iowa’s state health-insurance exchange had lost most of its providers, but not all of them). It was fun to listen to, because Trump — and this is still perhaps the most incredible thing about his candidacy, in retrospect — was somehow the first politician in however many decades of modern American political oratory to capitalize on the fact that nobody likes listening to modern American political oratory.  There was also a dissonance to these speeches, however, now that Trump had settled into his presidency. Before the election, his subversion of the forms of American politics served to underscore the basic argument of his campaign, which was that America’s problems could be solved easily if you overthrew the country’s governing class, with all their idiocies of convention. But Trump and his voters had done exactly that, and America’s problems had not instantly disappeared. One of Trump’s more reliable impulses is evading responsibility, and he spent much of these speeches herding together the scapegoats — the media, the recalcitrant Democrats, the F.B.I., the system — who might account for his situation, without appearing to realize that he was drawing the self-portrait of a man who had wanted power but gotten authority instead. On Aug. 12, white supremacists marched and then rioted in Charlottesville, Va., one of them running over a woman with his car and killing her. Asked about the episode in a news conference at Trump Tower, Trump insisted that “I think there’s blame on both sides” and described some of the white supremacists as “very fine people,” and amid the backlash that inevitably ensued, Donald J. Trump for President Inc. awakened, as it seems to do in times of trouble, to announce that on Aug. 22, there would be another rally, this one in Phoenix. The afternoon before the rally, I was settling into my seat in an American Airlines Airbus on the runway in Charlotte, N.C., when the pilot got on the intercom: “If everyone could take their seats quickly, please,” he said, a note of apologetic bewilderment in his voice, “we’re trying to beat Air Force One into Phoenix today.” Trump, he explained, was due into Phoenix around the same time we were. “If we don’t get in ahead of them, we’re going to be put in a holding pattern.” A groan went up from the passengers. “I got held up in Florida by Air Force One for four hours,” a woman sitting behind me grumbled. Across the aisle, an older man was saying something about Joe Biden and his Secret Service entourage taking up whole cars on Amtrak between Washington and Wilmington. “I’m just saying,” he protested, “both sides do this!” And so we hurtled west in our climate-controlled specimen vial of the national argument, trying desperately to outrun the man at the center of it. It was 107 degrees in Phoenix, and outside the downtown convention center paramedics with IV bags balanced on their shoulders were tending to rallygoers who had succumbed to the heat; an elderly woman in a Hawaiian shirt had toppled out of the V.I.P. line and was vomiting on the pavement. Inside, I passed a man wearing pleated khaki slacks and a sweat-drenched sleeveless undershirt with an American flag draped over his shoulders, serape-style, as if he were on his way to see Mad Max’s keynote address at CPAC. It was possible that the events in Charlottesville had depressed turnout, but it seemed just as possible that it was the heat, and the prospect of waiting outside for hours in it to file into a convention center that, when I got inside, was full, but not packed as other rallies had been. Trump recited from all of his post-Charlottesville news releases; he had them printed out. “I said, ‘Racism is evil.’ Now they only choose, you know, like a half a sentence here or there, and then they just go on this long rampage, or they put on these real lightweights all around a table that nobody ever heard of, and they all say what a bad guy I am. But I mean, do you ever see anything — and then you wonder why CNN is doing relatively poorly in the ratings. Because they’re putting like seven people all negative on Trump! And they fired Jeffrey Lord — poor Jeffrey. Jeffrey Lord.” Watching a public eruption of self-pity is an awkward experience, particularly when it is the president of the United States doing it. Even the crowd in Phoenix seemed a little unsure what to do with it, and they were the most sympathetic audience Trump could possibly have mustered. “Now, you know, I was a good student,” he went on. “I always hear about the elite. You know, the elite. They’re elite? I went to better schools than they did! I was a better student than they were! I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and I live in the White House too, which is really great. I think — you know what? I think we’re the elites. They’re not the elites.”  The crowd cheered for its newfound elitism, but the energy in the room was sagging palpably. It had been a long, hot day. They were still heckling the TV people in the media pen, but it felt unfocused, pro forma. “So the point is — and I didn’t want to bore you, because you understand where I’m coming from. You people understand. But the point is, that those were three different — there were two statements and one news conference. The words were perfect. They only take out anything they can think of, and for the most part, all they do is complain. But they don’t put on those words. And they don’t put on me saying those words.” The adjective I instinctively reached for, watching it, was “Nixonian,” but even Nixon generally confined this kind of thing to the White House tapes. Trump’s very public spleen-venting more closely resembled that of Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln’s vice president and the reluctant and disastrous steward of Reconstruction after his death. In February 1866, after Congress tried and failed to override Johnson’s veto of a law providing federal protections for freed slaves, he gave an impromptu speech to his supporters in which he compared his Senate antagonists to Confederate generals, fulminated about supposed assassination plots against him, and in the space of barely an hour, used his own name more than 200 times. Congress impeached him two years later. “This was a Castro speech in length,” Rick Wilson, the Republican strategist, was saying on the CNN-equipped flat screens at the Phoenix airport as I waited for my flight home. “It was an astounding chain of lies tied together by a man who obviously is mentally unstable.” David Jolly, the former Republican congressman from Florida, told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes the next day: “Listen, there is no moral equivalency between this president and some of the dictators we’ve seen in the Dark Ages of the Middle East and other places around the globe. But the politics of some of those dark dictators was to always have an enemy. And that is what this president has modernized.” It is true that it is hard to get through a Trump rally now without thinking of the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan or the other authoritarians for whom Trump has openly expressed his admiration. And yet, watching Trump onstage in Phoenix, the instincts he was following seemed to be much more those of an entertainer than those of a demagogue. It had the feel of being in the studio audience for an unusually angry late-night host’s opening monologue. He was a guy on a stage, improvising, trying to hold the crowd, toggling between the riskier material and the easy applause lines, trying to figure out what they liked and how to give them more of it. The applause for clean coal was tepid, so he moved on to Joe Arpaio. He talked about Jonathan Gruber, the economist who helped design the Affordable Care Act, but no one seemed to know who that was, so he reached into the tangle of Fox News chyrons balled up in the back of his head and came up with something about all the people who wanted to tear down George Washington statues, and the crowd roared its indignation at this movement that did not, in any meaningful sense, exist. These moments have political consequences, but when you are watching them in person, the imperatives at play seem mostly emotional; the needs on display are raw and visible, and curiously small. But then you see the same speech on a screen, outside the reality-impeding Faraday cage of the rally venue, and you are reminded that this is the president: that he commands a nuclear arsenal and a legal system that can put people in jail or throw them out of the country and a surveillance apparatus of godlike omniscience and an unshakably loyal third, at least, of the American population. The man is trying for “The Tonight Show” and it comes out as Hugo Chavez’s “Aló Presidente.” Sometimes, watching Trump at the rallies, I would wonder idly what quotations from these events would look like etched into granite on some plaque or building like other presidents’ speeches. (YOU ARE THE MOVEMENT. I AM THE MESSENGER. I AM JUST REALLY THE MESSENGER — ALTHOUGH I’VE BEEN A VERY GOOD MESSENGER, LET’S FACE IT, RIGHT? I’VE BEEN A PRETTY GOOD MESSENGER.) We’re used to presidents delivering speeches in front of an audience, but rarely really to it. It is the speech, not the speaking of it, that is the point; its true audience is not the people in the room, but the country, or the world, or history. These speeches operate in the shadow of proper nouns: the Military-Industrial Complex Speech, the Berlin Speech, the Malaise Speech. Do you remember that Ronald Reagan delivered his Evil Empire Speech to a convention of evangelicals at the Sheraton Twin Towers Hotel in Orlando, Fla.? Of course not. He wasn’t speaking to them; he was speaking to history. Trump does not speak to history except in extremely rare cases, like his Inaugural Address or his State of the Union address, in which circumstances absolutely, nonnegotiably force him to do so. Otherwise he is always speaking to a proximate audience; unlike other presidents, the speaking, not the speech, is the point. The words would make little sense without their immediate social context. To be a member of his audience is to feel valued, part of an intimate and privileged “you” defined in relation to some broader population: Gene Huber’s “we the people” rather than the Constitution’s. You feel flattered, in spite of yourself. Trump is so at ease on the stage that you momentarily forget what a hermetic figure he is, how odd his few direct interactions with his constituents, as president, have been: his incongruous congratulations to rescue workers after Hurricane Harvey (“We love you. You are special. What a crowd. What a turnout”), his calls to wounded survivors of the Parkland school shooting in their hospital beds. (“He said he heard that I was a big fan of his, and then he said, ‘I’m a big fan of yours, too,’ ” one student, Samantha Fuentes, told The Times. “I’m pretty sure he made that up.”) Trump’s most impressive accomplishment, probably, is managing to live almost all of his adult life on stages of his own construction. But in the rare gaps between stages, the occasions that do not exist for the express purpose of his celebration, you see the consequences of having lived such a life.  “Do you like me?” he asked us in the airplane hangar in Moon. He looked like he was feeling good — certainly better than in Phoenix. There was talk of his finally escaping the padded cell of convention and expertise that had half-contained his presidency. Gary Cohn, his chief economic adviser, and Hope Hicks, his communications director and human security blanket, had recently tendered their resignations. In three days he would fire — or rather, order fired — his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, and not long after that, his acting F.B.I. director, Andrew McCabe, and his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster. The White House lawyer who had been advising him on the Russia investigation, John Dowd, would quit. We — he and we, together — were forging deeper into the unknown, and it seemed to exhilarate him. The crowd did like him, and cheered. “I like you, too,” he said. “I love you! I love you! So — is there any more fun than at a Trump rally? You know, a lot of times, I have to do, like, readings — we’ll pass an environmental bill, they’ll want me to go to a — I’m very spoiled, if I go to a small place, and they have 2,000 people, it’s like, why don’t we open a stadium or something? We’re spoiled. Other guys, they go out, they get 50 people, they’re satisfied. We. Need. Crowds. Like. This. In fact, the fire marshal was fantastic. You know, they had a lot of people out — and he’s a great guy, I don’t want to get him in trouble, but he opened up those doors, and he let most of the people that were sent away, he got ’em — look at those corners! Those cameras are never going to cover those corners. They’re never going to cover the corners. They’re never going to cover — they never show the crowds. They never like to show the crowds, ever! The only thing is the noise. You can’t imitate — it sounds like a Penn State football game. It sounds like an Ohio State football game! I’ll say to friends, ‘Did you see my speech last night?’ ‘Yes.’ I have to say it: ‘How good was I? How good?’ And they say, ‘Good.’ I say, ‘Did they show the crowd?’ ‘No they didn’t. But you know what, I could tell by the noise, that crowd was really big.’ You can’t hide that. You can’t hide that.” I was there, and I can report that yes, the crowd was really big. You couldn’t hide that. Charles Homans is the politics editor for the magazine. He last wrote about Trump’s approval numbers.

Business,494," With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 1, 2018 Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • The markets and Trump’s tariffs. • Jared Kushner is criticized for meetings with business moguls who later helped his family’s company. • Stephen Schwarzman had a good 2017. • Walmart is the latest business to wade into the gun debate. • And Spotify opens its books ahead of its direct listing. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Investors might be tempted to take a trade skirmish in stride. When President George W. Bush slapped high tariffs on steel imports 16 years ago, the stock market slipped a bit but recovered in the following days. Likewise, stocks may bounce back from the decline that followed the news on Thursday that President Trump will soon introduce tariffs on steel and aluminum.  In recent years, the global economic order appeared to be under threat a number of times. But stock markets rebounded from Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, and the debt-ceiling clashes in the United States.  And there is a good chance that President Trump’s tariffs won’t cause a great deal of collateral economic damage. They may end up being softer than Thursday’s headlines suggest, as globalists push back. And like President Bush’s tariffs, President Trump’s may be quite narrow in focus and exist for a relatively short period. Investors could learn to live with those, just as they’ve mostly shrugged off possible changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement. But vulnerabilities exist right now that could magnify any negative impact of President Trump’s tariffs. The stock market is still highly valued after a searing rally that took it to an all-time high in January. The Federal Reserve expects to increase interest rates multiple times this year. Compare that with March 2002, when President Bush introduced his trade restrictions: The Fed was cutting interest rates, a policy stance that can help support the economy and the stock market; stocks were nowhere near their peak of two years earlier; and President Bush’s administration was, overall, globalist in its outlook and didn’t want to become isolated ahead of the Iraq war. Importantly, the United States economy is less dominant than it was 16 years ago. Last year, the United States accounted for an estimated 24 percent of the world’s gross domestic product, using data from the International Monetary Fund. In 2002, the share was 32 percent. If other countries retaliate, and tariffs broaden, the United States’ economy may be less resilient than some in the Trump administration may believe. — Peter Eavis We asked yesterday if his family’s real estate business was his biggest liability. Our colleagues’ latest story shows that might be the case. What happened • Josh Harris of Apollo Global Management, an adviser on infrastructure issues, met with Mr. Kushner several times last year. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies, triple the size of the investment firm’s average property loan. • Citigroup’s C.E.O., Michael Corbat, met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million.  Mr. Kushner, his family business, Apollo and Citi all said that nothing improper had happened. But the meetings raise questions about how the Kushner Companies is weighing down the political fortunes of President Trump’s son-in-law. Mr. Kushner has already had his interim security clearance downgraded amid a feud with the White House chief of staff, John Kelly. The WSJ editorial board writes, “Mr. Kushner and Ivanka have to decide if they’d serve themselves and the president better by walking away from their formal White House roles.” The politics flyaround • The White House is set to announce new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, according to unidentified sources. (Bloomberg) • Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and one of Mr. Trump’s closest aides, plans to step down. (NYT) • Mr. Trump publicly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions as “DISGRACEFUL” for not ordering his own investigation into the handling of the Russia inquiry. (NYT) From Ana Swanson of the NYT: President Trump said on Thursday that he will impose stiff and sweeping tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum as he moved to fulfill a key campaign promise to get tough on foreign competitors. Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect “for a long period of time.” The trade measures would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. It is unclear whether those would apply to all imports or be targeted toward specific countries, like China, which have been flooding the United States with cheap metals. The announcement capped a frenetic and chaotic morning inside the White House as Mr. Trump summoned more than a dozen executives from the steel and aluminum industry to the White House, raising expectations that he would announce his long-promised tariffs. However, the legal review of the trade measure was not yet complete and, as of Thursday morning, White House advisers were still discussing various scenarios for tariff levels and which countries could be included, according to people familiar with the deliberations. U.S. stock markets slipped around the time Mr. Trump made his comments about tariffs, with declines in the industrial sector outpacing the overall market. The Standard & Poor’s 500 industrial sector was down more than 2 percent, compared to the overall benchmark index which was down a bit less than 1 percent as of around 1:30 p.m. Automakers, large consumers of steel and aluminum, fell sharply. Another large consumer of those materials, aircraft maker Boeing also declined. As the country’s largest exporter, Boeing would also likely be affected by rising global trade tensions if other nations responded to tariffs from the United States. The comments also come on the same day as Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve, said this about protectionism: “There are many approaches to dealing with the costs of globalization, but protectionism is a dead end. Trade restrictions address the symptoms and not the underlying problems, and they introduce other costs and distortions. While such measures might generate a temporary boost to growth from greater domestic production and consumption, these would likely be offset by a range of other costs. Over time, such measures would retard productivity growth and thereby shrink the economic pie.” The co-founder and chief executive of Blackstone raked in $786.5 million last year, his biggest take-home ever, according to Bloomberg. His stake in New York-based Blackstone—and the $661 million in dividends it yielded—fueled much of the payout. The rest came from his cut of deal profits, salary and other compensation, according to the filing. In 2016, Schwarzman got $425 million. By comparison • Apollo’s Leon Black took home $191.3 million • Carlyle co-founders David Rubenstein, Bill Conway and Dan D’Aniello divvied up a combined payout of $193 million.  • KKR’s Henry Kravis and George Roberts received a combined $343 million. Jerome Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, said before the Senate Banking Committee: “We don’t see any strong evidence yet of a decisive move up in wages. We see wages by a couple of measures trending up a little bit, but most of them continuing to grow at two and a half percent. Nothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating. I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation.” Context Mr. Powell said the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday that the outlook for the United States economy had brightened in recent months. He added that the Fed expected to continue raising rates gradually and could even pick up the pace. The markets seemed to interpret the remarks as signaling the Fed would be more aggressive than expected in raising rates. But there was more evidence Thursday morning that inflation may accelerate this year.  Here are the  numbers from the Commerce Department: • Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4 percent. • That was the biggest increase since September.In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index rose 1.7 percent. • So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, the PCE advanced 0.3 percent in January — the largest gain since January 2017. • Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, rose at 1.5 percent in January. • The core PCE price index has undershot the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target since mid-2012. Just as the company isn’t holding a traditional I.P.O., it isn’t holding the usual kind of marketing road show either. On March 15, the music streaming giant will — what else? — live-stream a presentation for potential investors. Here’s what to expect, from the company’s prospectus: We will prepare an electronic presentation for this investor day, which will have content similar to a traditional roadshow presentation, and make one version of the presentation publicly available, without restriction, on a website. There can be no guarantees that the investor day and other investor education meetings will have the same impact on investor education as a traditional “roadshow” conducted in connection with an underwritten initial public offering. Spotify adds that it will hold additional “investor education meetings,” which would likely be reserved for the most important investors.  While traditional I.P.O.s generally post video versions of their road show presentations on sites like RetailRoadShow, the company looks like it’s trying something different. — Michael de la Merced DoorDash, the food delivery startup, raised $535 billion from a group of investors led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund and that included Sequoia Capital and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund. The amount is almost triple what the company had raised in the last five years, Bloomberg reported and values the company at $1.4 billion. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.     DoorDash uses a courier model popularized by Uber, meaning that it sends independent contractors to pick up and deliver orders. The company said it has partnered with nearly 90 percent of the top 100 restaurant chains, including Wendy’s, Chick-Fil-A, IHOP, PF Chang’s, the Cheesecake Factory and Five Guys. It was one thing for Dick’s Sporting Goods to set an age requirement for firearms sales. It’s another for the country’s biggest gun seller to do something similar. What each is doing: Walmart: Raising the minimum age for purchases of guns or ammunition to 21, and eliminating products that look like assault-style rifles. (The company stopped selling AR-15s two years ago.) Dick’s: Requiring buyers to be at least 21 and dropping AR-15s from its 35 Field and Stream outlets. The NYT notes that Walmart explicitly linked the new rules to the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. The company said in its statement, “In light of recent events, we’ve taken an opportunity to review our policy on firearm sales.” The gun control debate remains a tricky one to navigate, though more C.E.O.s feel compelled to speak up. Michael Dowling of Northwell Health told the WSJ, “We are people that other people look up to.” A caveat: While some capitalist activists are urging big mutual funds to sell stocks in gun companies, Stephen Gandel of Gadfly argues that such divestment campaigns don’t work.  The political context: President Trump made a surprising pitch for tougher gun regulations and urged Republicans to push back against the National Rifle Association. The group called his move “great TV” but “bad policy.” • Meet Martin Gilbert, whose investment fund could help decide whether the satellite broadcaster Sky sells itself to Comcast or Fox.

(FT) The hedge fund mogul finally called quits on his five-year campaign against the supplements company Herbalife, which he called a pyramid scheme and whose stock he once declared would go down to zero. A look back at the famous short bet, from Matthew Goldstein of the NYT: In the annals of Wall Street, investors have lost more on trades. But Mr. Ackman’s bearish bet on Herbalife was a signature event given how much time, effort and money he devoted to making his case — all in the hopes that the federal authorities would take action against Herbalife. Herbalife’s shares closed yesterday at $92.10, a record high. Memories: Herbalife was at the center of Mr. Ackman’s infamous televised debate with Carl Icahn, who was (and still is) betting on the company’s ability to grow. Where Mr. Ackman is focused now: United Technologies, the subject of rumors that the conglomerate may break itself up. Brooke Sutherland of Gadfly applauded the back-to-activism-basics bet. In other hedge fund news: David Einhorn had a bad month. Viking Global Investors is the latest firm to wade into big-data analytics.

Largely the tax cuts, for which both Republicans and Democrats are compiling data  to support their political arguments.

Business,495," With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 28, 2018 Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Spotify files to go public. • Dick’s Sporting Goods will stop selling assault-style rifles. • The end of an era for Ackman; the start for another one? • What to make of Wall Street’s response to Mr. Powell? • The Federal Reserve is walking a monetary tightrope. • And is Jared Kushner’s weakness his family business? Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Perhaps more than any other streaming service, Spotify has revived the fortunes of recording artists. It is funneling billions of dollars from its subscribers to music companies, which, for the most part, faced a bleak future. But a charity Spotify is not. The company appears to be taking a bigger and bigger cut of the revenue it receives from listeners, according to numbers first made public on Wednesday.  The numbers are included in Spotify’s financial filing with Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of listing its shares on the United States stock market. They strongly suggest that Spotify has successfully flexed its muscle as it negotiates the price it pays record companies for music. This shows up starkly in the filing’s discussion of an expense item called cost of revenues, which, the filing says, “consists predominately of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming.”  The filing says Spotify had €3.67 billion of premium streaming revenue last year. The cost of that revenue last year was €2.87 billion. The difference between those numbers, the gross profit on streaming revenue, was equivalent to 22 percent of that revenue. That is well up from 16 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015. And how did Spotify bolster its margins? A big factor: It signed more advantageous licensing agreements with music companies. “This decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of premium revenue was driven largely by a reduction in content costs pursuant to new licensing agreements,” the filing said. But can Spotify keep turning the screw? The music companies might be willing to compromise on price because the overall amount of dollars they receive is going up, making life easier for the first time in years. But, with Apple, Amazon and others adding subscribers, competition is intensifying. The music industry might be able to exploit that. — Peter Eavis Accounting nerds delving into Spotify’s filing will have stumbled on an odd discrepancy. Two metrics that attempt to capture how much cash a company is taking in had very different totals for 2017. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was negative to the tune of €324 million last year. But net cash flows from operations totaled €179 million in 2017. Both totals benefited from adding back large noncash financing costs. So what items bolstered operating cash flows but not Ebitda? It looks like operating cash flows did better in part because Spotify waited to pay some of its bills. Such items make up what is often called working capital. Spotify wrung €439 million of cash out of working capital in 2017. The question for investors is whether the company can do that every year. — Peter Eavis The streaming music service filed its prospectus for a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, an unusual route that bypasses the traditional initial public offering process. Direct listings essentially move trading in a company’s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market.  Wall Street and Silicon Valley will watch Spotify’s listing closely. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. Wall Street bankers are unlikely to cheer such a development. Direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O. Spotify won’t embark on its roadshow, a series of meetings with investor ahead of the listing, for at least 15 days. Here’s a look at the details: Ticker symbol: SPOT Price range for private shares in 2017:  $37.50-$125.00  Price range for private shares this year:  $90.00-$132.50 Valuation range in 2017: $6.3 billion to $20.9 billion Valuation range this year: $15.9 billion to $23.4 billion Valuation based on the midpoint of its 2018 price range: $19.7 billion Loss: €1.2 billion in 2017, up from €225 million in 2015 Operating loss: €378 million, compared with €235 million in 2015. Revenue: €4.1 billion last year, up from €1.9 billion in 2015. Free cash flow: €109 million in 2017 Ebitda: -€324 million in 2017 Monthly average users: 159 million last year, up from 91 million in 2015 Premium subscribers: 71 million, up from 28 million in 2015 Share of global streaming music market: 42 percent  The amount Spotify has paid in royalties to record labels since its inception: More than $8 billion Percent of total voting power controlled by co-founder and chief executive, Daniel Ek: 37.3 percent Percent of total voting power controlled by co-founder, Martin Lorentzon: 43.1 percent Risks of a direct listing: “Our ability to sell your ordinary shares at or above the price you bought them for due to (i) our listing not having the same safeguards as an underwritten initial public offering, which may result in the public price of our ordinary shares being volatile and declining significantly upon listing, or (ii) the failure of an active, liquid, and orderly market for our ordinary shares to develop or be sustained.” Despite a sharp selloff in financial markets in early February, the market for public offerings started 2018 with a bang. Through late February, 30 companies publicly listed their shares on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The pipeline of listings to come is also strong. On top of Spotify’s listing, which should come in the next few weeks, Dropbox filed paperwork last week to go public. One of the U.S.’s biggest gun sellers, Dick’s Sporting Goods, said that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, as well as limit sales of any gun to those 21 and older. In doing so, the retailer is steering directly into the controversy that has embroiled companies that have taken on the American gun lobby. Dick’s C.E.O., Edward Stack, told the NYT: “When we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset. We love these kids and their rallying cry, ‘enough is enough.’ It got to us.” What’s next: Mr. Stack wants what he calls “common sense” changes to gun laws, like the steps his company is taking and broader universal background checks.  Why it’s remarkable:  Other companies, big and small, continue to sever ties to the National Rifle Association. Delta has been openly dressed down — and potentially punished — by Republicans in Georgia after eliminating discounts for N.R.A. members. (Gun control is certainly a hot topic in the midterm election campaign.) And then there’s this: FedEx and UPS are feuding over ties to the N.R.A. Over five years ago, Bill Ackman boldly announced that he was shorting Herbalife, declaring the company a pyramid scheme and vowing to see its stock price down to zero. Today, Mr. Ackman finally gave up on that quest. The Pershing Square Capital Management chief told CNBC that his firm had finally exited the short bet. That’s after: • Mr. Ackman’s frenemy, Dan Loeb, took the other side of that bet. • So did Carl Icahn, in one of the most prominent public spats in recent Wall Street history, before the two men made up. (That didn’t stop Mr. Icahn from continuing to bet on Herbalife.) How did Herbalife investors respond Wednesday? They pushed shares in the company up 8.5 percent to $94.04, an all-time high. But Mr. Ackman has found a new investment: United Technologies. Why? The hedge fund mogul told CNBC that he liked the company — which happens to be considering spinning off parts of itself as a way to get more value for the conglomerate’s shareholders. Shares in United Technologies were up 2.1 percent this afternoon, at $136.73. — Michael de la Merced For months, the former real estate investor’s inability to get a permanent top-secret security clearance has been a lightning rod for criticism. Now his interim credentials have been docked to secret and his West Wing portfolio clipped — and people are asking what happened.  One thing that has come up, per the WaPo, citing unidentified U.S. officials: Officials in China, Israel, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates have discussed how to manipulate him by taking advantage of his business dealings and complicated finances. Speaking of the Kushner business: It’s is in talks to buy Vornado out of 666 Fifth Ave., the troubled Manhattan skyscraper that the two own, according to the WSJ. Critics will ask, where would the money come from? Is it scaring off users? So far the answer seems to be no. CNBC reports Snap’s download rates have remained strong, according to App Annie. And Snap’s shares are up 5 percent. Background Snap’s redesign, which has been rolling out over the past few months, has faced growing criticism from users and weighed on the stock. Last week a tweet from Kylie Jenner, saying she did not open Snapchat, sent the stock tumbling 6 percent. Wall Street has picked up on the customer backlash and a couple of analysts have downgraded the stock. The criticism has also overshadowed Snap’s positive fourth-quarter results earlier this month that pushed its shares up nearly 50 percent. BlackRock thinks that could be a risk to its business. From the risk factors in BlackRock’s annual report: As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as “common ownership”. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices. The filing goes on to say: If the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers, BlackRock’s business operations, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected. That is how John D. Herrmann, an analyst who covers the bond markets for MUFG Securities Americas, reacted to the testimony in Congress of Jerome Powell. In a note to clients yesterday, Mr. Herrmann cataloged upbeat remarks that Mr. Powell made, and observed that Mr. Powell seemed optimistic not just about the current economic environment, but also the outlook for the next three to four years. What to make of Wall Street’s response to Mr. Powell? One interpretation is that Mr. Powell wants investors and others to be more prepared for higher interest rates. Wall Street seems to have settled on a scenario in which the Fed raises interest rates steadily over the next two years. Any sign that rates may rise much more quickly than expected could cause a panicky pullback in the financial markets, which could ultimately harm the economy. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.     To help prevent that, Fed officials can say things aimed at prompting investors to give more consideration to certain outcomes.  Is it working?  Arguably, if investors were more concerned, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note would be higher than the 2.88 percent it traded at on Wednesday morning. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is forecasting the 10-year Treasury yield will be 3.25 percent at the end of this year. Anyone surprised that the yield gets there far more quickly should not be after Mr. Powell’s testimony. — Peter Eavis • Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has floated the idea of rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, more than a year after President Trump walked away.

(NYT) It’s because the British satellite broadcaster Sky — which Comcast and 21st Century Fox are poised to fight over — is a smaller example of what U.S. telecom giants want to become. More from Stu Woo of the WSJ: Sky is both a telecom operator — selling TV, internet and phone services — and a media company with its own original news, sports and entertainment programming. And Sky has reach beyond the U.K. market. It is a Pan-European operation, with businesses in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. It’s also probably because everyone is worried about Netflix. Critics’ corner: Investors are right to expect a bidding war, according to Chris Hughes of Gadfly.

Business,496," With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 23, 2018 Good Friday.

Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. The cloud storage company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering.  DropBox is the latest so-called unicorn, Silicon Valley startups with a private valuation of more than $1 billion, to test the public markets.  Here are the details: Underwriters: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Allen & Co. BofA Merrill Lynch, RBC Capital, Jefferies, Macquarie Capital, Canaccord Genuity, JMP Securities, KeyBanc Capital and Piper Jaffray. Exchange: Nasdaq Capital structure: Class B shares will have 10 times the voting power of Class common shares. The holders of Class B shares will continue to control the company after it goes public. Last summer the FTSE Russell and Standard & Poor’s said most newly public companies with dual or multi-class capital structures would not be included in their indexes. Big shareholders: Drew Houston, the co-founder and chief executive, has 24.4 percent of the voting power, while venture capital firm Sequoia Capital has 24.8 percent. Mr. Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, a co-founder, have a combined voting power of 34.3 percent, which is greater than 32.3 percent for the three outside investors listed in the offering document. Executive compensation: Mr. Houston’s total pay last year was more than $110 million, including more $109 million in stock awards. His base salary was $400,000. Mr. Ferdowsi’s total compensation was $47.3 million. The financials: In 2017, Dropbox lost $112 million but its cash flows totaled $330 million. The reasons for the difference: Dropbox had large noncash expenses, like stock compensation and depreciation and amortization. But revenue growth is slowing. Dropbox took in $1.1 billion of revenue in 2017, a 31 percent increase from $845 million in 2016. The company’s revenue surged by 40 percent in 2016. Dropbox will have to convince investors that it can add new paying users at a fast clip. It had 11 million paying users in 2017, up 25 percent from 2016. But that was a significantly slower pace than the 35 percent increase in 2016.  In theory, Dropbox could squeeze more revenue out of each user, but it has not managed to do that in recent years. Revenue-per-user was $111.91 last year, not that different from $110.54 in 2016 and $113.54 in 2015. Valuation: Early investors in unicorns are obviously betting that their stake will be worth more when the company goes public. But Dropbox’s investors might be disappointed. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the offering will value Dropbox at $7 billion to $8 billion. That is below the implied $10 billion valuation for Dropbox when it raised money in 2014, the Journal reported. Shira Ovide at Bloomberg’s Gadfly uses a valuation for Box, a public company that stores and manages content in the cloud, as a guide for how much Dropbox might be worth on the stock market. Ms. Ovide’s conclusion is not encouraging. 
            Hard truths for Dropbox: Box trades at 5x forward revenue. If Dropbox grows at the same rate as 2017 to $1.45B, then it's valuation would be ~$7 billion. Not what Dropbox wants.         — Peter Eavis and Stephen Grocer A series of companies has severed their relationship with the National Rifle Association after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., following pressure from customers.

On Thursday, the First National Bank of Omaha said it would not renew its agreement to issue an N.R.A.-branded Visa card. “Customer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the N.R.A.,” the bank said. And Enterprise, which owns two other rental car brands, Alamo and National, said it would stop offering a special discount for N.R.A. members. Andrew notes: It took real leadership for Clark Lauritzen, First National Bank’s president, to make this decision. Will other C.E.O.’s who talk about social responsibility follow suit? Mr. Lauritzen’s bank is privately held by his family, so it may have been easier for him to take such a stand. Visa tried to distance itself from all of this by saying, “Visa co-branded cards do not represent an endorsement by Visa of that cause or organization.” But it also appears unwilling to sign on to the idea I proposed that it prevent customers from using its network to buy assault weapons, high-caliber magazines and bump stocks when it said in its statement about First National Bank ending its deal with the N.R.A., “We strive to make our payment services available to all people in all places, for uses consistent with local, national, and international laws.” The context Groups have previously pushed the investment industry to dump gun stocks, with limited impact. Pension funds, including those for public-school teachers in at least a dozen states, own shares in gun makers. And major money managers such as BlackRock and Vanguard are indirectly some of the biggest holders of gun stocks through exchange-traded funds. BlackRock says it can’t divest shares of a company in an index, but with $6 trillion under management, it is often effectively the biggest investor in such businesses.  Lawmakers in New Jersey moved this week to restrict the state’s public pensions from investing in the shares of gun manufacturers. BlackRock said it planned to reach out to weapons makers “to understand their response” to the shootings.

(WSJ) Top members of the British government met Thursday to agree on what sort of relationship they want to have with the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc. The B.B.C. has details of the meal that was served at the meeting, held at the official country retreat of Prime Minister Theresa May: A cream of sweetcorn soup with a ham hock croquette, a Guinness short rib of Dexter beef with onions and parsnip mash, and a lemon tart with raspberry sorbet and fresh raspberries. The menu is a reminder of how often food is used to help understand Brexit. Cherries: The British government’s position seems to be that it wants to abide by some European Union rules that would be advantageous for trade, while discarding others. In the Brexit debate, Britain’s attempts to pick and choose is commonly described as cherry-picking, and top officials of the European Union have said they won’t let Britain take this approach. And for Britain to ask for three baskets of cherries is likely just too much for the European Union to stomach. Why? Cake: The rationale for not letting Britain take an à la carte approach is that it allows the country to have its cake and eat it. Underpinning the European Union is the belief that the benefits of being more closely integrated are often obtained through compromises that all member countries must make. And to supporters of the bloc, Britain’s desire to opt in for some things and not others corrodes that community spirit. The cake and cherries rhetoric thrown around in the Brexit debate suggest there is little middle ground between the European Union and Britain. But an alternative way to view the tensions is that so much trade goes on between Britain and the bloc, and others ties are so deep, that both sides will ultimately strike a new relationship that retains much of the existing one. As analysts at Nomura wrote earlier this week: In terms of the bespoke deal issue, we think it is not credible to say the U.K. can only take an off-the-shelf Norway / Switzerland / Turkey / Ukraine / Canada / Mexico deal. They were all bespoke deals when they were made. The idea that the world’s seventh largest economy, an ex-member and a country that will still have strong institutional, economic and geographic ties to the E.U. should not get a bespoke deal is not reasonable, in our view. And the Sun newspaper is reporting that some in European Union may actually want to throw Britain a few cherries. The Sun’s Nick Gutteridge, who often has fresh insights from Brussels, has details of a paper drafted by the Belgian government: The paper, produced by the Belgian government for a meeting of diplomats last week, will prove a huge boost to British negotiators and gives new insight into E.U. thinking. — Peter Eavis President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda seems to have met its match in the obscure world of international financial regulation. On Thursday, we wrote about the Treasury Department’s decision to retain the process for winding down a failing bank that was introduced under the Obama administration.  A big reason the Treasury held back: The concerns of foreign regulators. As the Treasury’s proposal stated, an alternative to the Obama-era wind-down is a new form of bankruptcy for large financial firms, called Chapter 14. The Treasury favors using Chapter 14 where possible, but it opted to keep the current resolution mechanism. This disappointed Republicans who want Chapter 14 to replace the the current process. But foreign regulators pushed back against a bankruptcy-or-nothing approach. Specifically, the Treasury noted, foreign regulators have expressed doubts about whether they could coordinate effectively with a United States bankruptcy judge when winding down a big American bank that has large amounts of business overseas. On that point, the Treasury could have pushed back. It could have told foreign governments that Chapter 14 judges would, in fact, be up to the task of handling international cases. Indeed, the Treasury in its paper said it expected the judges to have such competency: Further, these judges, once designated, could engage in planning and coordination exercises, including cross-border efforts (e.g., the crisis management groups discussed above). Instead, fearing higher costs for United States banks, the Treasury apparently gave the concerns of foreign regulators considerable weight and took an internationalist approach. — Peter Eavis The Chinese manufacturer has built up a $9 billion stake, or just under 10 percent, in the German automaker and parent of Mercedes-Benz. From Bloomberg: The investment in the parent of Mercedes-Benz furthers Hangzhou-based Geely’s foray into the European premium automotive market and ends months of speculation. The Chinese company, controlled by billionaire Li Shufu, already owns Volvo Cars AB, whose refreshed line-up of vehicles have made it a popular alternative to the German luxury stalwarts. Geely also gained control of British sports-car maker Louts Cars last year. The government in Beijing seized control today of Anbang Insurance Group, the troubled Chinese company that owns the iconic New York hotel. The details • The Chinese insurance regulator said Anbang had violated regulations, putting into question its ability to pay claims. • A group that includes China’s central bank, its securities and banking regulators, the country’s foreign exchange regulator and other government agencies will oversee Anbang for a year. • The takeover could be extended if Anbang fails to complete an equity restructuring and resume operations. • The company’s former chairman was charged with financial crimes. The context Anbang came under scrutiny for its opaque ownership structure and for the political ties of its former chairman as it embarked on a period of frenzied deal making. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.     But, “Anbang is too big to fail,” as an unnamed senior Anbang executive told The FT. “Even though it has no real value, they will have to restructure it very carefully.”  From Keith Bradsher and Alexandra Stevenson of the NYT: China was shaken three years ago by a surge of money out of the country and concerns that its economy had been layering on too much debt. Anbang and the other Chinese deal makers, which had borrowed heavily to fund their shopping sprees, soon drew attention from officials. State media labeled them “gray rhinoceroses” — big problems that are ignored until they start moving fast. Critics’ corner • Quentin Webb of Breakingviews writes that the seizure is the boldest move yet in Beijing’s battle against financial excess, and the new precedent could be a worrying omen. • Anbang’s size and entanglements are comparable to Lehman Brothers or A.I.G. before the global financial crisis, and the insurer was always going to crash and burn if left untouched, writes Nisha Gopalan in Bloomberg Gadfly. Beijing’s intervention deserves a round of applause, she adds.

That’s the NYT’s James Stewart, who tries to unpick the puzzle. Separately, a group of Harvard graduates has a plan to bolster the university’s straggling endowment. The Treasury Department has proposed a regulatory move that would increase the likelihood that a failing bank would end up in bankruptcy rather than going through a resolution process overseen by the government. The tweak would still keep the emergency structures introduced as part of Dodd-Frank as an option. From the NYT’s Peter Eavis: Crucially, the Treasury also wants to keep the emergency government loan. But the Treasury’s proposal does introduce an important and innovative change. It calls for a special type of bankruptcy regime for large financial firms, called Chapter 14. This new regime envisions having a set of specialist judges, working with regulators in the United States and around the world, who could plan for and oversee the bankruptcies of large banks.

Business,497," With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 21, 2018 Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • What it takes to be a whistle-blower. • Broadcom whacks Qualcomm for raising its NXP bid. • Untangling the productivity mystery. • How Skadden got involved in the special counsel’s Russia inquiry. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. Sigmund Freud is reputed to have said that “sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.” The Supreme Court took that approach in deciding what is required to qualify for protection from retaliation as a whistle-blower. A provision in the Dodd-Frank Act defines a “whistle-blower” as someone who provides “information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.” That seems simple enough, but the Securities and Exchange Commission made something of a hash out of the requirement by taking an expansive view in a rule aimed at protecting an employee from retaliation even if the person only reports information internally.  In Digital Realty Trust v. Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, Paul Somers, claimed he was terminated after he reported possible securities law violations to senior management. Although he never alerted anyone outside the company, Mr. Somers filed a lawsuit claiming his termination violated the anti-retaliation provision by relying on the S.E.C.’s rule.  The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: “Courts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition—tell the S.E.C.—Congress imposed.” By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistleblowers. One of the complaints expressed by companies when the S.E.C. considered the whistle-blower rules was that they did not require employees to report information to management first. The incentive created by the Digital Realty ruling is straightforward: Don’t just tell your boss about possible violations; make a beeline to the S.E.C.’s front door, at least if you want protection from retaliation. — Peter J. Henning The Dow Jones industrial average rose 139 points in the half-hour after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent policy meeting at 2 p.m. and was up more than 300 points on the day. Then the index sank 455 points in the final 90 minutes to close down 0.67 percent for the day. Why? There didn’t appear to be anything in the minutes to make investors particularly bearish or bullish. Perhaps the bond market was to blame for the plunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises as its price falls, kept climbing after the minutes came out, closing at 2.95 percent. Higher bond yields can make stocks look more expensive, prompting investors to sell. As a result, Wednesday’s mini move indicates that the tug of war between the stock and bond markets is still very much on. While we’re on the Fed minutes, it appears that the central bank’s policymakers did not spend much time discussing an indicator that is flashing a warning sign. The data point in question is the saving rate, which recently sank to a 12-year low. With the rate at 2.4 percent of disposable income, a big drop in the stock market, like the one that occurred earlier this month, could prompt consumers to cut their spending. The Fed’s policymakers did not appear overly worried about the saving rate at their last meeting, which was held before the market’s plunge. The minutes state: In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained. — Peter Eavis Qualcomm defied Broadcom’s demand not to raise its takeover bid for NXP on Tuesday by increasing that offer by about 16 percent, to $127.50 a share from $110. Now Broadcom has retaliated. Broadcom shaved $3 per share off its hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm, to $79. Broadcom’s rationale is that the new NXP offer transfers value away from Qualcomm’s shareholders. From the news release: Broadcom believes that a responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value by following ISS’s clear recommendation to work with Broadcom on the NXP transaction and negotiate the sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom. Instead Qualcomm’s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP’s activist stockholders. Let’s take a look at the math  • Broadcom argues that Qualcomm gave up $4.10 a share, or $6.2 billion, in value to NXP shareholders. In response, it cut its price. At $79 a share, Broadcom’s current offer is just under 13 percent higher than its original offer. (Of course, other elements of Broadcom’s last bid — the $8 billion breakup fee for antitrust reasons, the ticking fee if a deal takes more than 12 months to close — still stand.) • Broadcom also contends privately that had Qualcomm agreed to start deal talks, the two of them could have held firm against NXP shareholders like Elliott Management and Soroban Capital Partners. By giving up less negotiating power to the holdout shareholders, the argument goes, Qualcomm could have recut the NXP deal at a far lower price. • Qualcomm argues privately that the $4.10 a share is nonsense, since the NXP deal a) wasn’t going to get done at $110 a share and b) will still add to its earnings per share price starting in the 2019 fiscal year. The bet on the shareholder meeting Broadcom had previously said that it would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share, but now seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm’s annual shareholder meeting. Broadcom wants six seats on Qualcomm’s board. That campaign gained momentum when the proxy advisers I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for at least four of its director nominees. A Qualcomm representative didn’t have an immediate comment. How the shares moved today: Qualcomm’s were down 1.5 percent, while Broadcom’s were up slightly. Shares in NXP — the real winner in this deal saga so far — were essentially unchanged. — Michael de la Merced The deals flyaround • Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason pressed Xerox to pursue alternatives to its complicated deal with Fujifilm.

            But might the return to full employment fuel a rebound?         FEB. 20, 2018 An economy is doing well when companies each year manage to become more productive, or in other words, get more output from their employees and equipment. But productivity for years has grown far more slowly than it did in the past, effectively restraining economic growth. This decline has prompted economists to hunt for causes – and the latest big work on the issue comes from the McKinsey Global Institute. The Upshot’s Neil Irwin does a great job of explaining McKinsey’s main finding: The latest wrinkle is that the researchers now believe that productivity growth depends not just on the supply side of the economy — what companies produce and what technologies they use to do it — but also significantly on the demand side. That is to say, productivity advancements don’t happen in a vacuum just because technology is available. They also happen because companies need to increase production to match demand for their goods, and a shortage, either of workers or of materials, forces them to think creatively about how to do so. Little in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey’s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond.  1) In its report, McKinsey notes that the slow down in productivity growth was noticeable before the financial crisis. What caused that? And to what degree did those causes contribute to the decline in productivity growth after the financial crisis? This is important because these forces could continue to weigh on productivity. In the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence. 2) If a sluggish economy can create the conditions for weak productivity, why did France, Spain and Italy, whose economies were anemic in the period under study, have significantly better productivity performances than faster-growing countries? First, the numbers: From 2010 to 2014, labor productivity grew by 1.4 percent a year in Spain and 1 percent in France, well in excess of the negative 0.2 percent rate for Britain and the United States. Why was that? Because Britain and the United States had made superior productivity gains before 2010. That made it harder for the two countries to notch similarly strong productivity growth in the years after the financial crisis. By contrast, France and Spain, which had made far fewer productivity gains before 2010, were able to eke out at least some afterward. Ms. Remes also points out that a big cause of Spain’s post-2010 gain came from a reduction in hours worked. That might be described as the least desirable way to bolster productivity because it implies a reduction in incomes for workers. The most economically beneficial type of productivity gain occurs when output per employee increases as hours worked grow. — Peter Eavis New research posted by France’s central bank, the Banque de France, shows that the largest companies in the United States now account for a significantly larger share of production. This dominance, the paper asserts, could allow the companies to enjoy “monopoly rents,” the term economists use to describe the subsidies companies enjoy if their business is protected in ways that are not available to other firms. “If these firms hold a dominant position in their market, they enjoy monopoly rents and have little incentive to invest in order to increase their productive capacities. This behavior could explain the weakness of investment in recent years, despite the high rates of return on capital.” David Wessel, writing for Harvard Business Review, also recently took a look at whether dominant companies are holding the economy back. — Peter Eavis The largest United States bank by assets announced that it plans to tear down its current headquarters at 270 Park Ave. and build 2.5 million square-foot modern tower in its place.  The new headquarters has yet to be designed, but it is expected, according to Bloomberg, to be between 70 and 75 stories and house 15,000 employees. The current headquarters was designed in the late 1950s for about 3,500 employees, JPMorgan said. During construction, employees will be temporarily moved 237, 245 and 277 Park Ave. and 383 and 390 Madison Ave., Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter. The tower would be the first major project under New York City’s Midtown East rezoning plan, designed to encourage office construction in the area. The job recruiting site said Wednesday that it has hired Jim Cox as its C.F.O., as part of a series of high-level executive appointments. Mr. Cox was most recently at Lithium Technologies, a maker of customer relationship management software. Here’s what Robert Hohman, Glassdoor’s C.E.O. and co-founder, said: “We are pleased to welcome Jim to Glassdoor as our new CFO as he brings a proven track record of building and managing financial operations and teams at high-growth technology companies.” Glassdoor also appointed Christian Sutherland-Wong, most recently its general manager of monetization, as its first chief operating officer, and Samantha Zupan, a longtime executive, as its vice president of global corporate communications. — Michael de la Merced The giant law firm’s work for the former Trump campaign manager — who has been charged with several criminal acts by Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian election interference — has come into question after a former Skadden associate entered a guilty plea in the investigation.  More from Kenneth Vogel and Andrew Kramer of the NYT: The interest from prosecutors in what Skadden did for the Ukrainian government is one indication of the wide-ranging nature of the inquiries related to Mr. Manafort. It also highlights the risks associated with advising authoritarian governments overseas, a lucrative sideline among Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations consultants. Skadden’s response: It fired the associate in question, Alex van der Zwaan, last year, and is cooperating with Mr. Mueller’s team. Elsewhere in Russian election meddling: Here’s what we still don’t know about Facebook’s role. Chris Hughes, a co-founder, said Facebook must do more to prevent foreign interference. President Trump blamed Barack Obama for not being tougher on Russia. And meet the  oligarch who helped fund Russia’s troll agency. The judge overseeing the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner denied AT&T’s request to see government communications about the case. He ruled that AT&T had not “made a credible showing” that the White House had singled it out for retribution. More from Cecilia Kang of the NYT: The decision puts a crimp in AT&T’s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal. AT&T had already agreed to take the Justice Department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, off the witness list — but could call him during the trial if needed. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.     The trial begins March 19.

Business,498," With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 20, 2018 Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Judge deals AT&T a setback in fight with Justice Department • Billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen lost a bid to seal a sex discrimination lawsuit against his investment firm. • Corporate leaders are discussing whether the finance industry can help regulate gun sales. • Walmart’s fourth-quarter earnings missed expectations. • Facebook is still facing blowback for an executive’s tweets about Russian electoral meddling. • Qualcomm’s revised bid for NXP raises questions about Broadcom’s pursuit of the company. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. The telecom company had asked for internal communications between the White House and the Justice Department regarding AT&T’s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner.  On Tuesday, a judge ruled that AT&T was not entitled to those documents, saying the companies had not “made a credible showing that they have been especially singled out.”  AT&T has argued that the Justice Department has unfairly singled out its proposed merger with Time Warner partly to stay in favor with the White House. President Trump has been a vocal critic of Time Warner’s news network, CNN, and said before the election that the deal should be stopped. The bigger picture Cecilia Kang of the NYT:  The decision puts a crimp in AT&T’s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal. The merger would transform the media landscape by combining a television and movie giant with one of the nation’s biggest media distributors. The trial is set to begin on March 19. For the first time, and after much protest, public companies must report their employees’ median pay and compare it with that of the chief executive. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed nearly eight years ago, required the disclosure, and firms are now disclosing it in proxy reports for 2017. Companies, lobbyists and some compensation experts spent years criticizing the rule, arguing that it revealed little about pay trends and was of little use to shareholders. The Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal-leaning think tank, on Tuesday noted that Honeywell was the first United States corporation to release the ratio. The company’s C.E.O., Darius Adamczyk, had a total pay package of $16.8 million in 2017, which was 333 times the pay of the median employee. The rule allows certain companies to exclude some foreign employees from the calculation of the ratio. Honeywell excluded workers from several countries where pay is most likely lower than in the United States. “The 333:1 ratio that Honeywell is reporting most likely would be even wider if Honeywell took all its workers into account,” the Institute said. — Peter Eavis A federal judge in Manhattan, in a brief order, rejected a motion filed by lawyers for Mr. Cohen and his firm, Point72 Asset Management, to temporarily seal a complaint filed last week by Lauren Bonner, an employee of the firm. Mr. Cohen’s lawyer had asked the judge to seal the lawsuit, which alleges the firm underpays female employees and fosters a hostile workplace for women, pending the resolution of another motion to push the matter into arbitration. Judge Analisa Torres of Federal District Court in Manhattan said the request to seal the entire complaint was “not narrowly tailored” and was inconsistent with the “presumption of public access” to court records. Lawyers for Mr. Cohen had sought to seal the order because it contained details of other employees’ compensation packages. The lawsuit also detailed a testosterone-fueled “boys’ club” atmosphere in which men commented frequently on women’s bodies and belittled their abilities.  — Matthew Goldstein Andrew writes: My latest column, on how banks and credit card companies could restrict support of gun sales in the wake of last week’s school shooting, has stirred up chatter in the business world. I’ve heard from people throughout corporate America overnight since it was published. Many said privately that they want to look at what they can do. More from the column: There is precedent for credit card issuers to ban the purchase of completely legal products. Just this month, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America banned the use of their cards to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. To be clear: Those three banks won’t let you use your credit card to buy Bitcoin, but they will happily let you use it to buy an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle — the same kind of gun used in mass shootings in Parkland; Newtown, Conn.; San Bernardino, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex. Elsewhere in gun regulation: President Trump expressed some openness to tightening background checks. The United States Treasury Department is flooding the market with debt. On Tuesday, the government sold $179 billion worth of debt. Bloomberg reports: “Concerns about the U.S. borrowing cap had forced the Treasury to trim the total amount of bills it had outstanding, but that’s no longer a problem and the government is now busy ramping up issuance. Financing estimates from January show that the Treasury expects to issue $441 billion in net marketable debt in the current quarter and the bulk of that is likely to be in the short-term market.” That’s been a regular question since the tax overhaul was signed into law last year. Analysts at Goldman Sachs in a note over the weekend shed some light on the answer. • “Companies have pointed to a modest increase in investment as one destination for the incremental cash flow from tax reform. Consensus estimates for 2018 capex have increased by $17 billion (3 percent) since the passage of tax reform.” • Last month 39 S.&P. 500 companies increased their dividend, while for the first since 2012 no companies cut their payments. • Buying back shares remains a priority of companies, Goldman writes. Over the past 2 ½ months, S.&P. 500 firms have announced $171 billion of buybacks, $67 billion of which has come this year, a 22% increase from the same period in 2017. In the same note, Goldman also took a closer look at this earnings season. By many measures, corporate earnings are the strongest they have been in the past decade. Goldman points out: • Companies in the S.&P. 500 are set to report that profit grew 15 percent last quarter. That’s the fastest pace since 2011.  • The percentage of companies beating estimates is at its highest level since 2010. The percentage beating sales forecast is at its highest since 2004. But the stock reaction to S.&P. 500 companies either beating or missing expectations “has been muted relative to history.” The reason? Investors are more focused on tax reform and earnings forecasts for 2018, Goldman writes. Analysts have raised their 2018 earnings estimates for companies in the S.&P. 500 by 7 percent so far this year. Some context Higher profit margins because of the lower corporate tax rate are driving much of the increase in this year’s earnings forecast. A point that becomes clearer by looking at 2018 sales estimates. Analysts have increased their revenue forecasts by only one percentage point and much of that increase comes from higher oil prices boosting forecasts for energy companies. Remember when the company said that it was changing its name from Long Island Iced Tea and shift its corporate focus to virtual currencies? Well, new developments have come up: • Long Blockchain has named a new C.E.O., Shamyl Malik. • It plans to spin off its beverage division into the publicly traded Long Island Brand Beverages by June 30, and the company’s last C.E.O., Philip Thomas, will be on the new business’ board. • And last week, Nasdaq informed Long Blockchain that it planned to delist the company because its stock price had traded too low. Long Blockchain’s market cap as of this morning was $31.9 million, below Nasdaq’s threshold, after shares in the company tumbled amid the great crypto crash of early 2018. The company is appealing. — Michael de la Merced Here’s why the company’s shares are down 10percent — their biggest fall since 2015 — after its fourth-quarter earnings report: • The company earned $1.33 a share, while analysts had expected $1.37. • Operating income fell 28 percent, to $4.5 billion, thanks to charges tied to the closing of Sam’s Club stores.  • E-commerce sales rose 23 percent during the quarter, a slower pace than in previous quarters. • Full-year sales growth expectations went down by close to half, to 1.5 percent to 2 percent, in part because of Sam’s Club and a curb on the sales of tobacco products. What the company’s chief, Doug McMillon, said: “We’re making real progress putting our unique assets to work to serve customers in all the ways they want to shop.” — Michael de la Merced Days after Rob Goldman, its vice president of advertising, tried to clear up misconceptions about the company’s role in the 2016 presidential election, Facebook still finds itself in hot water. President Trump took the tweets as proof that Russia didn’t try to help him win, while critics said they contradicted Robert Mueller’s indictment. Mr. Goldman apologized in an internal Facebook post. But his tweets — which contained inaccuracies — suggested that Facebook executives still don’t understand how central the company was to Russia’s misinformation campaign, according to Nicholas Thomson of Wired. More from Kevin Roose of the NYT: In real-world terms, a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed, rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes, and no alarms or locks on the doors, and then acted surprised when burglars struck. Josh Hendler, the former head of tech for the Democratic National Committee, told the WSJ, “It was an almost perfect example of Silicon Valley overconfidence and lack of sophistication when it comes to politics.” The tech flyaround • One sign of how highly Google and Facebook value A.I.: The researchers sit near their C.E.O.s.

(Reuters) With Qualcomm raising its offer for NXP to $127.50 a share from $110, it may have finally found a way to beat back its persistent and unwanted suitor. Broadcom has said a higher NXP bid would be a deal-breaker (as of this morning, however, Michael hears that it isn’t clear whether it will walk away). The new offer may have come at an opportune time: I.S.S., the influential proxy adviser, recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for four of Broadcom’s six board nominees. (But that too falls short of Broadcom’s goals. The company’s C.E.O., Hock Tan, has said he would walk away if the entire slate wasn’t elected.) A question: Elliott Management, which campaigned against the $110-a-share offer, is on board with the new one. But will Qualcomm’s shareholders accept paying more for NXP? It and other hedge funds stand to be big winners from Qualcomm’s raised offer. Bloomberg points out that Elliott, Soroban Capital Partners, Pentwater Capital Management and Farallon Capital Management own 47 percent of NXP’s shares.

Has Disney’s latest blockbuster erased the notion that there aren’t big audiences for movies with largely black casts? More from Brooks Barnes of the NYT: Richard Gelfond, chief executive of IMAX, the large-format movie exhibitor, which played “Black Panther” in more than 60 countries, championed Disney for delivering “content that is compelling on its face but also bridges the gap between different cultures, and ultimately is a reflection of the shared values of moviegoers all over the world.” Random musings (spoilers ahead!): What effect would Wakanda opening itself up have for global trade balances? What would happen to mining stocks? How would its immigration policies work if the country’s ruler says, “In times of crisis, the wise build bridges?” Does Wakanda have its own blockchain technology? Investors have been held hostage until they paid Bitcoin or Ether ransoms worth millions of dollars, as criminals increasingly target at the crypto-rich. The worst part: There’s no way to halt or reverse a Bitcoin transfer.

                MARCH 8, 2018 Last week saw so many wonderful comments that we were moved to make a note of it on Twitter: 
            We've read 1000+ comments by students on our writing prompts every week since 2009, but today has been extraordinary: Students commenting on each other's writing across schools, having notably thoughtful, respectful convos on guns and more. Thank you. https://t.co/153O3yKaKh         The best of all that commenting can be seen below in the individual posts and conversations we chose as favorites. We heard from new schools in Fresno, Calif., New Egypt, N.J., and Texas and Georgia, as well as from old friends like a school in Danvers, Mass., and we noticed students choosing from among prompts past and present. (Though we don’t include old questions in this roundup, some we asked over a year ago lit up again this week.) Before we leave you to the student roundup, we want to call out the one school that is perhaps most responsible, week after week, for comments across forums, and for encouraging students to respond to each other thoughtfully: Wilmington, N.C., we love you! If your teacher is reading this, please ask him or her to write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com, and tell us how this writing has become such an embedded part of the curriculum. Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ Our most popular writing prompt this week — “Is It Harder to Grow Up in the 21st Century Than It Was in the Past?” — was suggested by a student reader, Jordyn, 14, from Westfield, N.J.   With over 150 comments, it seems this was a question that was on many young people’s minds. The majority of students said yes, it felt harder to grow up today than it was in the past — and they overwhelmingly attributed it to the abundance of school shootings and everyday violence, which has left them feeling less safe than their parents and grandparents.  Brandon Brodwater from Wilmington, N.C., put it this way: I have always heard my parents talk of their childhoods; how carefree they were, how simple everything was, and how blissfully ignorant all the kids could be. As a kid today, a child of the 21st century, I can certainly say that growing up is no longer like that, not even remotely. I was born on August 24, 2001, not even a month before the attacks of 9/11. I was learning to speak at the start of the Iraq war, starting kindergarten at the time of the Virginia Tech shooting, and graduating elementary school when the Sandy Hook massacre happened. I feel as though my entire childhood has been overwhelmed with seeing tragedy after tragedy. As the one Harvard student said, “We’re the school shooting generation.” With extreme violence becoming commonplace in everyday life, I have found myself stripped of my childhood and deprived of my innocence. I can never go out without thinking about a potential shooter. I can’t think about politics and foreign relations without thinking about nuclear war. No child should have to think about these things, however they are seemingly pushed down our throats. It can’t be helped, it’s simply the day and age we live in, a time of violence and uncertainty. So yes, I certainly believe that [David] Brook’s understanding of our generation is true. We have been exposed to much more than ages before us. However, I also agree with Brooks in that as students, we can use this. Just like with the movements #MeToo and BLM, we are the future of social change. Ryan Brooks from Danvers, Mass., like many other commenters, said social media has ultimately made life more difficult for teenagers today: I personally believe it is harder to grow up in the 21st century than it was in the past mainly due to social media and the internet. Although I obviously was not alive in previous centuries and therefore cannot compare personal experiences in each time period, I know for a fact that previous generations did not have the iPhones and social media platforms we have today. Many people argue the benefits of social media: being connected to distant friends and family, being caught up in world events, spreading positivity and protest, etc. However, the negative aspects of social media outweigh the positives for most teenagers growing up in the 21st century. Cyberbullying is a huge issue, and I have experienced it personally. In the past, if you were bullied, you would see the bully at school, but then you could retreat to the safety of your own home at the end of the day. Today, you are never safe from bullies thanks to social media. They can harass you through the phone even when you are at home. I’ve had people prank call me, leave harassing text messages, post about me on Instagram and Snapchat, etc. It’s torture. In earlier centuries, the technology for cyberbullying to take place on would not have existed and kids growing up back then would not have to deal with it. Lizzy K. from New York eloquently summed up the concerns of her generation: We grew up thinking that there was a finite number of years left on the earth because of exhausted resources and global warming. We grew up accustomed to the feeling of being left out because we are constantly aware of our friends activities. We grew up in a world where the offensive rhetoric of politicians and other supposed role models is almost expected. We grew up being accustomed to the news of shootings of children who seem eerily similar to us. We grew up where facts, something that is indisputably the case, are disputed. We grew up knowing that if not us, many of our friends would be sexually assaulted. And the worst part is, we grew up thinking that the world just was this way. There is complex web of unsolved social issues and utterly pessimistic views of the world that has created a thick cloud over our generation. With every new social movement from climate change, to religious equality, to racial equality, to women’s rights, to sexual assault awareness, to gun reform, comes the recognition of this completely flawed and helpless world. So when people label us the generation of the iphone, the igen, or even the snowflake generation, they seem to be ignoring all of the awful events that occur so regularly in today’s world. Maybe they didn’t grow up with this list of horrible realities on constant replay. Maybe we will be the generation that makes actual change. Not everyone was convinced that this generation has it harder than others, though. Jennifer Lopez from Patino High School thought that teenagers today were lucky: As a young person growing up today, Mr. Brook’s understatement about my generation does not fully apply to me. Yes, my generation will be known as “school shooting generation” and we be known as a “generation where we make dumb challenges.” However, we are also known to be the first generation to express and accept any kind of sexuality and ethnicity. We are also a generation that “drives innovation” and “empowers others to fully accept who they are no matter what.” These “defining challenge” have always been around but never faced until now, which make it easier for a to “come out of the closet” or even to talk to others even, though they may not be the same “race or ethnicity.” Teenagers are able to express who they without getting judge in schools or even online, although they are always going to be people who will criticizes their being. However, people like that will always be around to bring others down and we just have to accept that fact. Not to mention our generation has access to the “internet” as a source to help us on anything whether it be homework, cooking, or learning how to play a instrument. We don’t have to struggle researching in libraries or we don’t have to worry about meeting with each other for a group project at a certain time at a certain place. We are able to make a group chat on almost any online platform, or we could also Skype each other without moving out of our comfort of our home. Therefore, is not as hard to grow up in the 21st. Ava Daly from Danvers High School also had an optimistic outlook: We may have lived through events in our life, but in this generation we have a chance to fix what we think is broken, where other generations have had to just live through it. Now, we can stand up for what we believe in and be the change we wish to see in the world. People growing up now are setting new boundaries and making a change in the world, where in the past we would not have had the voice. We have gone through a lot growing up in the 21st power, but with the right mentality it is what can make us stronger than any other generation if we take it to our advantage. Others, like Isabelle Silva from Massachusetts, saw both positive and negative aspects to being a teenager today: For me, childhood was filled with happiness and rarely doubt. Yet I didn’t realize that it was my parents sheltering me. I was barely a year old when 9/11 happened. I was eight when the stock market crashed. I was in middle school when Hurricane Sandy tore through New Jersey. The Boston Marathon Bombing? Yeah I was alive for that too. All of these horrific events just scratch the surface on what I have grown up with. My mom would say, “When I was in school I had homework, but never that much homework.” My dad would say, “When I was in school I was stressed, but never that stressed.” My grandma remembers vividly that when she was younger, after a sport’s season was over, it was over: it didn’t continue for another four months and another $1,000 until it drained out you and your parent’s bank account. Growing up in the 21st century is a new type of difficult, a new type of struggle. However, despite tumultuous times, I have also experienced things older or even future generations may never have the ability to. When I was one the first iPod came out. When I was 8 the first African-American president of the United States was elected. In 2012, Curiosity, a US rover, took a selfie … on Mars. And through all this time the New England Patriots had won four super bowl titles (and in 2016 they would make it five (obviously)). Both the good and the bad together have allowed me to appreciate how lucky I am to not only live somewhere amazing with an good support system but just to be alive. Katherine Y, from Rivendell, said every generation has its challenges: For a middle-class kid in a developed country like the U.S., the fundamentals, physical needs of life are easily met. I don’t have to worry about famine like my Chinese grandparents did. I don’t even need to cook my own meals, like my mother did. We have vaccines and medicines for sickness. However, one can argue that the generations before lived in a simpler time. My mother often tells me how life now goes much faster than it did when she was growing up. With social media and the internet, information travels fast. We are constantly supplied with news, trends, pop culture. Kids nowadays know more, sooner. How young was I when I was first exposed to the idea of school shootings? With all this fast-moving media, kids must grow up faster, or be left behind. I feel like the mental aspect of growing has become more complicated, while the basic, physical aspect has become easier. Nearly everyone, however, found one place in which to put their faith and hope for a better future: themselves. Lola Calotychos from Providence, R.I., articulated this sentiment beautifully: It’s very difficult to determine which generation has endured or is enduring the hardest times American society has ever seen, but because I am currently observing the social turmoil and sharing the outrage possessed by so many throughout this country, it is effortless for the abominable events of this century to be amplified in my mind to the point where their severity seems incomparable. I think that the aspect of this generation that has stood out so vibrantly to people, and therefore brought about this surge of attention, is its strength. The surplus of movements and awareness that have been enacted in order to advocate and oppose those in power has depicted a resiliency that defies the notion of America being an exemplary nation where everyone is “free” and “equal.” In a country that hosts an array of nationalities, races, and ethnicities, a large sector of the population have come together to change the way their country is being run in hopes to cater to the American peoples’ best interests as a whole, despite the inequitable executive orders coming from the monopolized institutions that hold seemingly all the power in our society. This generation is pushing to redefine this country’s values; we are reshaping the way democracy, a system in which society is governed by the people, is constituted and implemented, and despite previous times, it doesn’t look like we will ever take no for an answer. And Carolyn G from Virginia thought technology was helping help her and her peers make a difference: As a teenager, I can absolutely say that it’s not easy for my generation. These days, we have seemingly all the information we’d ever need at our fingertips, and in some ways, that’s made life better for us. We’re more aware than past generations — for example, you hardly ever meet someone who doesn’t have an opinion about Trump these days, teens and kids included. However, as a result of that, we’re also more aware of the injustices of this world, which can be a tricky thing. On the one hand, it can create a fire inside the hearts and minds of young people trying to change the world they live in, like how victims of the Parkland shooting are actively campaigning to pass gun reform laws because the People in Charge simply won’t listen to them. On the other hand, though, it can make us pessimistic. Now that we’re so aware of the problems we’ll have to face as adults, we worry not only about short-term things like applying to college (which is also worlds harder than it used to be); we also worry about the long-term issues we face, like a warming planet, which can be bad for our mental health. The good thing is that enough of us still have hope that we can make things better. We attend marches and protest online, we voice our concerns and make people listen if they don’t hear us, we work hard even when our parents tell us we’re lazy. Life is hard, even in this age of technology and general woke-ness, but we’re trying, and I think that’s really the most important thing. But several students also felt burdened by the responsibility to “change the world.” Jessica Lee from Wilmington, N.C., wrote: Many people believe that growing up in the 21st century is actually easier than it was in the past due to new technology. But with this, comes an abundance of consequences. Recently, new technology has paired with new data, and not all of it is good. Global warming, air and water pollution, icecap melting, ozone layer holes. They all say it’s up to us to find a solution; it’s up to us to save our world. And while they argue on whether or not we should arm teachers with guns (which, I’m not sure why it’s even a question), numerous young minds are looking for something — anything — that will help us rescue our world from destruction. So, in this sense I believe Mr. Brooks is right by saying, “this is a generation with diminished expectations.” I don’t expect our predecessors to fix much. I expect things to get worse before they get better. I believe in our generation, who is actively trying to reverse climate change. Not the government, not anymore. All we have is us. And we can do it. Our generation is not like the past. We have big hearts and open minds. We are gay rights activists, we are environmental activists, we fight against school shootings, and for the lives of African-Americans. Our generation has a voice that is potentially louder than any other. This is why our generation has it harder than those in the past. And although we’re growing up with a world’s worth of information in the palms of our hands (literally), the question is: What are we going to do about it? _________ Our popular Picture Prompt ""Boys and Men,"" raised the questions, “What does it mean to ‘be a man?’ and “Are America’s boys broken?” Pedro Chavez from Caruthers, Calif., thought a man should work: To be a man you have to work hard to help your family out because if you don’t and be lazy people are going to call you little girl and you won’t become a man just by doing nothing you need to go out and do something not just stay home like everyone else. Heriberto from Caruthers thought a man needs to be responsible: To be a man is someone who stands up for themselves and someone who is responsible. If you’re a man you are going to man up and if you’re a man you are going to be responsible and take consequences on your actions. A man is someone who protects his family. Sure girls can take care of their families but men are the ones who work and they are the ones who take responsibility of their family. Girls can also work but it is supposed to be the man who is in charge of all that stuff like the bills. That is my opinion of being a man. Bang Bang from Caruthers thought a man should not act immature: I think that being man is to mature and not to act immature and when hard things come in your life you have to be a man. Being a man is being aggressive strong and is tough both physical and mentally, for example if you fall you have to be a man and take the pain Brooke Myers of King of Prussia said it is enough for a boy to try his best: Society’s version of men is that they are supposed to be good people who know right from wrong, who are supposed to never make mistakes, who are the ‘perfect balance,’ who are tough but soft at the same time. I agree with this for the most part but they don’t always have to be perfect, they can make mistakes because that is the definition of humanity and men are humans. They don’t have to get into fights or be all ‘macho.’ They are allowed to have feelings. A man is a imperfect person who is a good person, over the age of 15. If a boy tries his best, is not too young, and is a generally good person, he is a man. Lola Byers-Ogle from Wilmington, N.C., was happy to see the messages her little brother was learning: I have a little brother who is almost 7-years-old. They are teaching him that masculinity is using your power in society as a male to stand up for women and others who don’t have that power. It is being sensitive, kind, understanding, being articulate about your feelings, and most of all realizing that these characteristics are not weaknesses. I agree with this. Sadly, a lot of guys are raised with the idea that being a man means showing no weakness. The author of the article says “America’s boys are broken,” and I agree. Guys are taught to hide their feelings which can create aggression because they aren’t getting the help that they need. Maddie Leber from Wilmington, N.C., replied to Lola, above, and said: I think it’s great that schools have been introducing new ideas in masculinity into the systems. Boys are always taught that “being a man” means being detached from emotions, not showing your scared or upset, and being strong. I’m glad that young boys are being taught a different definition of strong. I hope your brother grows to be sensitive, kind, and understanding, just like he is taught. Emiko Andrews from Wilmington, N.C., also thought about her little brothers: Despite not being a man, the concepts of masculinity and the ways it can become toxic are of great interest to me, and when reading about them, always make me think of my little brothers. Before this article was posted as a writing prompt, I read it and sent it to my mom, who sent it to the head of my brothers’ middle school. I love my brothers and am always trying to protect them, and I know my mom is too. I want them to know that they don’t always have to guard their emotions from the world, because they are human like anyone else. I want them to know that masculinity does not have to be aggression, or insensitivity, or anger. Instead, I want to teach them that it should be defined by courage, not only in the face of adversity, but in protecting those you care about, learning about and exploring the world we live in, and in asking for help when you need it. Jocelyn Savard from Wilmington, N.C., saw the negative effects of social conditioning on boys and men: Man up. At what point did this common saying become a threat? Probably the first time it was uttered, if we’re being honest. This picture says a thousand words, it tells the story of innocence and violence, calmness and assertiveness, understanding and a lack of understanding. The young boy still has large eyes: a trademark of innocence. His hand, cocked back signifies the expected aggression that has been forced upon him at a young age. After reading the article, my eyes were opened to the horrors that boys all over face each day. Not just boys who turn violent because of expectations but boys who turn their violence against themselves. Men die by suicide 3.53 times more than women. The article clearly articulates how men and boys are not allowed to show their emotions and the negative effects throughout their lifetimes. Recently, I caught my younger brother rapidly uncrossing his legs when we were out. It caused a commotion much larger than the normal uncrossing of the legs. “Why’d you do that?” I asked. His simple response was “boys don’t cross their legs.” How terrible, to only be 11-years-old and to have been told you can’t sit a certain way because of your gender. He’s also been told that he can’t have his fingernails painted nor wear heels and that he shouldn’t like the color pink. Boys do not have to be assertive or aggressive, they do not have to hide their emotions, they can like the color pink, and they can cry. Let them be human. Do not let them “man up.” Francesca Altunyay from Wilmington, N.C., said no one should feel trapped in a particular identity: I think the gender binary has been way too excessively controlled by society. Toxicity has manifested in the ridicule and harassment people have suffered for nonconformity or for not adhering to specific rules concerning gender. Girls are being called “dykes” if they cut their hair too short; the words “fag” and “gay” are thrown around carelessly if a guy so much as sheds a single tear. How people should act based on their gender has become almost a topic of obsession, and it’s weird how entitled people think they are to be the police officers of expression. I think it’s wrong to control how boys should act and set a standard of masculinity based on almost emotional ignorance that is basically impossible to meet all the time. … Men deserve to have full access to the “language that exists to discuss the full range of human emotion,” as Black puts it, because no one should feel trapped within their own identity. Villagehome from Beaverton, Ore., wanted all genders remembered in the words we use: I would like to remind people that there isn’t just men and women, some people don’t want either of those genders, and their gender isn’t determined by sexual organs. I just want everyone to be careful with what words you use. Denislav Kasaivanov from Wilmington, N.C., discussed his strong family culture and its influence: Having grown up in a culture which expects strong masculinity from all men around, I would have to say that being “a man” is like being able to do a little bit of everything. To give you an example, in the Eastern European culture from which I have been raised in, a man is expected to carry his family financially, he is expected to produce strong, successful offspring, he is expected to be at the peak of his physical fitness, he is expected to be able to protect his family, cook, and additionally, a man is expected to follow older, gentleman-like civil standards; of which you may find in similarity with chivalry. Moreover, often when I feel a bit down, my grandmother (or “babushka,” as I call it) will tell me to ‘man up some more’. If you haven’t noticed, my birth society’s common theme in masculinity is strength, be it ranging from mental to physical. Emily Lane Player from Hoggard High School said the issue needs addressing just as much as harmful treatment of young girls: American ideas of masculinity are toxic, especially to young boy’s ears. Common sayings like, “be a man” “grow a pair” “man up” “boys will be boys” and “boys don’t cry,” can make young men feel like they can’t be emotionally vulnerable. They fear if they are, they will no longer be seen as “manly,” and be bullied for seeming more feminine. Often young boys who don’t conform to gender roles by expressing themselves are put down and called “gay.” This is a pressing issue in America right now, and needs to be addressed just as much as the harmful treatment of young girls. Noah Q. Berg from Southwest-Central Wilmington, N.C., thought a man must be a decent person: I think that “being a man” is not about being aggressive and strong and it isn’t about fitting into gender roles, but rather about being a decent person. A real man treats women with respect, he works a job to provide for his family, and he supports his children in their endeavors. A real man is the type of person that will protect those more vulnerable than he is in times of harm, and not be self centered or self indulgent. Sydney, 13, from Oregon, said the key is to be a good human being: Society has high standards for men. Men have to be muscular, tough, unfeeling, are always right, can have whatever they want in life. An interesting thing about this is that although society generally says that men don’t (or shouldn’t) have feelings, it tends to give them one. Anger. Violent anger. No sadness, though, nothing that will make them look “weak,” or worse, “girly.” Girly is a stupid term. Men cannot be “girly”; it’s impossible! Absolutely ridiculous. My idea of a man is literally nothing. I have no ideas of men that are different from my ideas of women, other than the obvious bodily differences. Men and women both are human. Humans have emotions and feelings, and it’s okay to show them. Men, you don’t have to be “tough” or “manly.” There is no “masculinity” to preserve. You are a human. So act like one. _________ Our Student Opinion question “Is ‘Black Panther’ a ‘Defining Moment’ for the United States — and Particularly for Black America?” inspired lively conversations across schools in the comments section. Rachel Long from Wekiva High School thought it was a historical moment: The movie “Black Panther” was an incredible movie that I would recommend to anyone, no matter race or ethnicity, but especially to young black children in America because it is such a defining moment in America at this time. A movie that depicts black men as kings and princes and warriors with real emotions opposed to thugs or slaves or the butt of a joke, and a movie that depicts black women as the strongest among them and as smart and as true warriors is something that is so important for young black kids especially growing up in America today. I think that “Black Panther” is going to be the movie that opens the path to other majority black movies that depict black people I the same light and uplift and support opposed to tearing down. As did Dante P. from Fresno, who compared it to the Harlem Renaissance: “Black Panther” is such a powerful movie due to the fact that it breaks out of the stereotypes that black culture has mostly been confined to in Hollywood and media as a whole. The main concept is what would happen if an African country was never colonized and does an excellent job showcasing the history of intelligence and innovation in Africa that is not usually taught about in schools. The movie centers itself in a culture of African pride and excellence that is similar to the goals of the Harlem Renaissance. There is a certain feeling of pride, hope, and inspiration that people of African descent experience when they are able to go to a movie and see wildly successful black people achieve success without selling drugs, killing innocent people, etc. For many, this is the first film that makes them proud of their heritage, and then they check the credits and the film is almost entirely Black produced and so it verifies the feasibility of such a concept. The film also breaks gender stereotypes and the result is an Afro-futurism theme with many of the main characters being these powerful, strong women and intelligent women that promote women in STEM. Noah Q. Berg from Southwest-Central Wilmington, N.C., though, wondered whether its significance was overblown: I think that it is a bit far-fetched to say that a superhero movie is a defining moment in American history. When it comes to African-American history, defining moments were the civil war, the election of President Obama, and Dr. King’s “I Have A Dream” Speech. I could imagine a film course talking about this movie 50 years from now, but I can’t see an American history class talking about this movie 50 years from now. Cheyenne Newkirk from Wilmington, N.C., replied, calling it a “long overdue gift”: I have personally yet to see the movie, but it definitely has made an impact in the black community. The moment the trailer came out, black people celebrated. It was almost as if we had received a long overdue gift that celebrates black people. While I think the movie has inspired many to take action such as the petition to release the black panthers from jail I also think that we as black people cannot stop at just this. We need to go out and make change happen in the real world. We need to fight for the equality and respect that we have struggled for. This movie is a movie that celebrates black people. But WE need to celebrate ourselves too. Every person had the capabilities to do anything, and we should come together to make the change happen. And Lauren Thornton from Providence, R.I., added interesting ideas to the thread: I definitely do believe that “Black Panther” is a defining moment for black America. Being a black American in the US you grow up not really knowing where you come from. All you know is that your ancestors were considered 60 percent of a person and always had to change themselves to be accepted. “Black Panther” is celebrating what black people have been shamed for for many years, and now in a time where the BLM movement and Black Excellence is so widespread, it gives black people a sense of pride and a sense of belonging, like we are more connected to our roots. Having an all-black cast where everyone is powerful, makes brown boys and girls feel like they can be powerful too. Even though other people might just see this as “another superhero movie,” I think it has sparked and will spark more conversation among black people, and forever be something we were glad we got to live through and see. Mark Mormando from Wilmington loved the movie, but wasn’t sure it had the power to change society: This movie is easily one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces Marvel has created. From the creative ancient history of Wakanda, to how the civilization has grown over time with technologies the which we can only hope to achieve, this movie tells a great story through a great perspective. … Although this movie has a cast composed of many famous black actors, I don’t think this movie is going to change anything. Sure, it boasts a cast comprised of a majority of America, but besides those actors who portrayed a comic-book story, I don’t understand how this leads to something different happening in our country. I think it’s a great thing that Marvel made this movie, but that’s all it is, a movie. There are many other cinematic stories of struggles the black community has faced in America, and you don’t hear about those movies being hailed as cinematic masterpieces, not so much so as “Black Panther,” from what I’ve seen. Why is that? Rishi G. from Austin responded with detailed arguments: Not only is “Black Panther” a watershed moment for black people, it even centers its focus into separate groups. It manages to portray black people as powerful without having to force their hand at the stereotypical guns or drugs, and although at the beginning it shows this, it is just acknowledging that there are still people who do, in fact, fit that stereotype, but that is just a very small minority. In Wakanda, it shows black people as they can be when allowed to grow to their full potential: powerful, prosperous, yet humble and generous. But it doesn’t only focus on black people in general. In Shuri, T’Challa’s sister, we find a headstrong, intelligent, and funny woman who embodies the idea of women in STEAM. I think that the hype for this movie is well-deserved. Not only is the scenery and cast incredible, as well as the storyline causing you to not only get the hero’s point of view, it allows you to see it from the other side. I think that the thing that really did it in for me when watching the movie, though, was the incredible soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar. The music represented a culture clash, but harmonized into some amazing raps and songs. They incorporate the ancient tradition of Wakanda, but technology is implemented well in the beat and lyrics. I think the reason that this movie specifically is portrayed as a defining moment as compared to other black struggle movies is because it doesn’t show blacks as the sole victim. It portrays everyone as equal. Jose Clase from Providence, R.I., expanded on those ideas: I believe “Black Panther” to be a defining moment in America, especially in 2018. For the first time in America’s history, a film that touches on issues like more black girls getting into STEM, black people being in positions of power, but most importantly, instead of showing the pain and hardships that black people have endured, it demonstrates the success that can be achieved if they are united. Personally, I’m into comics and I’ve always known about Black Panther but to see his character in a solo film where kids can someone like them be amazing, smart, and strong; it makes an impact in those young kids lives. That touches on why I believe the film is so popular today. There’s so much social activism going on and with a generation of kids who are standing up for themselves , the film is a turning point into a more well-rounded America. I believe it to be a political stance but more importantly a message to the younger generation of black girls and boys; that they can grow up to be the a president or scientist or inventor, and so on. _________ Our Student Opinion prompt, “Have You Ever Changed Your Mind About a Hot-Button Issue?” brought in many impassioned comments with thoughtful views. Angela from Rhode Island thought it is helpful to put yourself in another person’s shoes: I have changed my mind on a controversial issue. I feel as though, what made me change my mind about it was actually being in the situation, where the topic had an effect on me. Many people choose a stance from the outside bubble and don’t consider putting themselves in the shoes to know how they might be impacted. Aryana from Rhode Island said people are more likely to change after experiencing things firsthand: If someone challenges your position then you should look at both sides of the argument along with the actual facts, and if you’re wrong then you should be flexible and change. It is better to right then to be wrong and stubborn. Hee Yun Chung from California switched sides on gun control: I’ve changed my mind over the controversial issue of guns over the past year. Before I really dove into politics, I believed that the Second Amendment was an outdated law must be repealed immediately in order to stop gun deaths. I firmly believed in this position before I saw arguments from the other side. After doing some research, I changed my mind and thought that guns should be left alone and that no action was required to solve the gun problem in the United States. The reason why I thought this was because statistically, gun violence incidents like mass shootings were as rare as terrorist attacks. It is very unlikely that an American can become a victim of a mass shooting. Secondly, repealing the Second Amendment would be like starting another drug war or Prohibition. Whenever America has banned something, it never seems to work. When drugs were banned and criminalized, black markets and drug cartels easily filled the gap and provided the drugs to people. Back in the 1920s when alcohol was illegal, Americans easily went underground and drank alcohol without the knowledge of the government. I thought this way until the continuous mass shootings that took place in Las Vegas and Parkland. That was when I changed my mind to support tough universal background checks and some form of gun control that makes it harder for people to get guns that have the capability to cause another massacre like the one in Parkland. Robert Yates from Wilmington, N.C., had become more open-minded: For all of my life, I’ve grown up around people that are emphatically conservative. As most kids do up until they reach high school, I used to mirror the political opinions of my family members. It was only when I started to be more open-minded to other ideas that I moved toward a more centrist/left-leaning political perspective. An example of a drastic change in my personal beliefs was when I came to acknowledge the merit of the LGBT movement. There’s a member of my immediate family who’s homosexual and was hesitant to come out to me and my other siblings due to the nature of our family’s conservative beliefs. I felt bad about when I found out because it must be mentally taxing to hold back such a big secret so essential to someone’s personal identity for so long. I believe that in order to be taken seriously in any kind of debate, one must be open-minded and willing to change their opinion when faced with fresh or important evidence. And Emily Ball from Wilmington, N.C., had changed her mind on the issue of abortion: My parents also have a huge influence on my opinions and views, and one of the topics that my mind has been changed about because of my mom is the controversial issue of abortion. I remember taking a walk one day, trying to convince my mom that abortion is an act of evil and immorality, and how I was completely pro-life. I said to her, “how could anyone be pro-abortion? Pro killing babies!” she looked at me and said, “No one is pro-abortion, they are pro-choice, meaning that they support women having an option on whether or not they have an abortion.” Although I still didn’t agree with her, I was starting to see where she was coming from. Now, two years later, I am completely pro-choice. I feel that if a woman or girl feels that she is incapable of being an adequate parent, that she should have the right to an abortion. I respect others with the opposite view of that if the woman has the baby, that she will be helped by the government and churches to provide for the baby, and they actually carry out with that. The opinion that I do not respect is when the woman or girl is judged no matter what. _________ We loved reading the creative short stories and poems that students came up with for “Astronaut and Spider.” Here are some of our favorites: Tucker G. Oakley from Wilmington, N.C., posted two comments in order to spin this fascinating tale: I pulled them both closer to my face, it read: Liliana Smitherman, spouse to Havel Smithman, deceased: May 3, 2204. The rest was a brief synopsis of how she died… None of that mattered. Why! Tears began to rush down my faces, causing my suit to warm up to regulate temperature. I left for my expedition 2203! How long has it been, why did it take so long? There were no answers here, there never was for humans. The pain shot from my heart to my back, then to everywhere else that had never sensed pain before. There is no possible way for me to describe my sobbing, but Tholum could. I could hear the clicking of long longs creeping down the hall, muffled by buckets of tears and snot. I looked out of the corner of my eye to see a nine-foot Arachonion gazing at me with his 22 pupilless eyes, and he began to open up his serrated mouth before my translator module kicked in. “Why is it that you cry, Havel. The last time you shed a tear is when we witnessed Jol-5 explode in the wake of the Fregerhiem Regime. “Yet it was not this bountiful.” He said in a puzzled posh accent. “Why, you ask. Maybe because my wife, my beloved lily has willowed into the neverending firestorm of death. I’ve been doing this for at least 18 years now …Why is it that I just find out now she died one year after I was gone! When I could no longer hold her in my arms! That is why!” Most of this was covered in layers of coughing and snot, but he clearly got the picture. He continued: “Havel, I can’t sympathize with you, or tell you that it will be better tomorrow. But what I can say is that you are still alive, and yes of course it hurts, but wouldn’t she want you to stay safe now?” Tholum had both a way with words and slight telepathy to which he used to soothe my mind into a state of understanding. “If she was in your shoes right now and you were gone, wouldn’t you want her to stay alive for you? Wouldn’t her life be the center of the universe at that point? So just think about that.” Everything stopped for a moment. What could he mean by that, to stay alive for her … Maybe, maybe this was true. She would have tried to stop me from touching that space station, but instead, she sent me off with a hug and a kiss. Gods, this will lumber over my shoulders for a while, but I just need to take what Tholum said into consideration. How many light years has it taken for her message to reach me, and to still hold he smile in my damp glove? For love is love, and for the sake of my Lily, I swear I will make this life of travel worth your love. “Yeah. You know what Tholum, drinks are on me, Thank you.” I never thought my best friend would be a giant spider monster, but he made this shuttle more of a home than my own planet. Pvt. Havel Smithman, signing out. Bronwyn Williams from Wilmington, N.C., created a stream-of-consciousness for the astronaut: It’s empty. It’s all empty out here, there’s no sound but my thoughts and I can’t escape my thoughts unless … No, there’s no way, I can’t. And leave her alone? And leave behind thousands others waiting for my return for another step for mankind? I’ll stay here, I have to hold on but … it’s getting harder. I’ve begun to see things, things I don’t want to. Things uglier than, things worse than … these things are just the manifestation of my thoughts, my paranoia … I think, God I hope. And no matter how fast I run I can’t outrun my mind unless I render it unable to move … myself unable to move but I CAN’T, I’m telling you I can’t and-God what is that sound? I can’t stop my head from whipping around in every direction and I hear it again. Scraping … oh God awful scraping I can’t breathe, it’ll find me … I’ll find me and lose myself again. The shadows in every corner they’re moving, I swear they’re moving I need help, I NEED HELP. I hear it, I heard it, “nobody’s around to help.” A saccharine whisper, the bitter cold reminder, but I already knew. I already know I’m alone, it’s only me on this mission after all...just my thoughts after all. “And what if you’re not alone … what if we’re all waiting to end you? What if everything you know is false? What if you die out here all alo—” STOP it God please stop it I can’t stop thinking and I didn’t notice when but my face became wet and the monster drew closer, cold metal appendage in my hands, now through my chest. I’m sorry. Brooke Myers from King of Prussia imagined the astronaut’s backstory: Justin launched off into space for his first big space adventure. While getting onto the ship, the reporters were launching questions, cameras flashing, people questioning whether he was afraid. “Why would he be afraid?” he asked himself. He wasn’t afraid of space, he wasn’t afraid of heights, he trained for this. He was doing this for his family, his wife, his daughter. He wanted to be a hero. He launched off and when he looked around, he saw the huge luminous moon looming over him. He found it quite peaceful in space, for days he happily watched the earth and stars until one day he saw a space station that seemed to be a bar. He landed unsurprisingly confused. When he space walked into the building, there were ladies all around, luring ladies, that sweet talked and made him cheat on his beloved wife, his only fear. He feared to be like his father who teared his parents’ marriage apart by cheating and there he was thousands of miles away, long distance if you say, doing the same thing making his fear as real as his wife’s fear of spiders. Hailey R. from Caruthers wrote about heartbreak: He misses the girl who has his heart. He is in a place of the unknown and he longs for her warmth. The blackness around him shows so sympathy or empathy and the evil thats overcoming him is overwhelming. He want to be with her. He needs to be with her … She is all he ever thinks about and she is his everything. He is in a place that bounds no direction except into more deeper darkness and to … home, but there is a force of evil and something else keeping him form finding his way home to her, to his love. He will do anything ti find her again and to be with her. He is searching for his home again but for now all he can feel is coldness and surrounding darkness. Bella Cankurtaran from Wilmington, N.C., closely read the image as inspiration for a poem: Spinning through the black abyss Bursts of light dot the universe outside my window My heart longs for your light I steer ahead into the route of the unknown The thoughts of you cloud my head Like the clouds I see below me My heart wants to be home A web of dread tangles my thoughts Wraps up my happiness Consumes it in one bite My heart wants to be free I am left with my own bitter sorrow For someone planets away For someone all alone My heart wants to be with you After reading the article, I found that Jakub, the astronaut, was having marriage issues with his wife, Lenka, down on Earth. He is trapped for thirteen weeks on the ship, concerned about their relationship. I thought it was strange, but the spider is an alien creature brought to remind him of Lenka and his troubles, leaving him more than miserable. I feel like that doesn’t incorporate well into the serious matter of the issues between him and his wife. I thought the spider was more of a symbol of his lost ability to concentrate on anything but his wife, and the web it was spinning to block all other thoughts. _________ Are there any “dumb” devices — or devices not connected to the internet — that you think are better than some “smart” devices? We asked students that in our Picture Prompt ""Alarm Clocks,"" and got some great answers: Leah Schwagerl from Wilmington, N.C., thought older things were built to last: Can I just say, that as a 16-year-old I still cannot wrap by head around the idea of Amazons “smart device,” Alexa. It’s just creepy. As for “dumb devices,” I am really into cooking and one of the best kitchen gadgets I’ve used is the simple mortar and pestle. Some of the best guacamole, pesto, and humus I’ve ever had came from the ancient device. Not from last years newest food processor. I think one of the reasons I prefer old fashioned devices, not just kitchen devices, over new ones is because they were built to last. Elliott O’Deen from North Carolina agreed: I completely agree with this standpoint. Old devices were made to last unlike new ones that last a year or two. The Amazon Echo was not meant to last 30 years. It was made to last until the next new one comes out. In our kitchen we have timers that are 25-years-old. Yes they need battery replacements but they still work. I own an apple watch and it’s not really that great. It’s nice for replying to texts and doing simple math but personally, I like a regular old watch. I think it looks nicer and the batteries last for a really long time. Emily Sause from Wilmington, N.C., cherished a particular old-fashioned device: Sitting on the third shelf of my bookcase is a small wooden jewelry box from a small consignment shop years ago. Inside the box is a bellerina standing in an arabesque. When I wind up the small piece in the back of the box and let go, magic happens. The ballerina turns slowly and a soft lullaby plays. The box seems very simple, but the music is actually coming from precise markings on a metal cylinder. The music box is my favorite device and I will always cherish mine … I could listen to the same pitchy song on repeat for hours and hours. Babs from Richmond, Va., cited an 80-year-old family device: I LOVE my dumb fan. My phone app provides a noise, but it does not create a simple, cooling breeze. We own a fan that came free with a fridge in 1939; it still works perfectly. I challenge anyone to find some new “smart technology” that will still work perfectly and provide the exact same utility 80 years from now! Lisbeth Garcia from Rhode Island found advantages and disadvantages to smart devices: I think it’s not that easy to say there are “dumb” devices that are better than some “smart” devices because there are advantages and disadvantages to both devices. I myself, for example, like to use my phone and its reminder app, rather than a planner or agenda. My phone is a more convenient piece of technology because it is always on me and it gives me the option to set an alarm for that an option, rather than writing my reminders into a planner or agenda, where I’d have to take it out, open it, and look for what I needed to be reminded on. Maddie Leber from Wilmington N.C., said some new tech isn’t worth the hassle: There are so many things out there that seem so much fancier, but are just a hassle when it comes down to it. One of the things that affects my life the most is my fitbit. I like to keep track of my steps, and it’s easy to use as a stopwatch and just for checking the time, but with most electronic devices, it has its flaws. Just like the article stated about the apple watch, you have to tilt the fitbit at a certain angle for the time to pop up on the screen, and sometimes I have to violently shake my wrist back and forth until I give up and press the button on the side of the fitbit. This can be extremely annoying when I’m doing something time sensitive or have my hands full. Just last week I was taking a math test and trying to see how much time I had left, when the time would not come up. I wasted about 40 seconds just trying to check how much time I had leftTechnology is amazing, and is designed to make our lives better, but sometimes those little inconveniences, such as the time not popping up when I move my wrist, can add up. Those devices that were designed to help you, just end up hurting you in the long run. _________ Students’ interpretations of our “Graduate” Picture Prompt were almost universally negative about the role of data in education. Ellie Hannum from Wilmington, N.C., suggested it showed how schools reduce students to numbers: According to the image, we are NOT unique because of what we look like, our personality, or our ability to problem solve and think critically. The education system ingrains one simple fact into our developing brains throughout our entire education career: grades, test scores, GPA, and class rank are the ONLY things that will make you unique, define you as a person, and ultimately determine your future. The image defines the high expectations that universities hold to their students in a colorful, cheerful, and simple pie chart. However, these expectations are far from simple. That simple little pie chart completely covers the student’s face, which could symbolize how filling these expectations takes up all of a student’s time and effort. Amy Jean from Providence, R.I., agreed, and shared her own experience: From my perspective, this image is commentary on how the grades students get in class and on assessments define them in the eyes of the school system. This is symbolized by the numbers and graphs surround the graduate student and the pie chart obscuring the student’s face. I often feel as though I am not really learning anything in most classes, that all that matters is whether I past the tests or not. … I feel like the person in this image, obscured by numbers. Nick Hargrove from Wilmington, N.C., made a connection to a class discussion: When I first saw this image it reminded me of a discussion my class had. The graphs and binary code made me think that the article would have been about students prioritizing the STEM fields while the arts take a back seat. I interpreted that the grey background as another hint that students were coming out of college with knowledge in the STEM fields but were unable express themselves and were just blank. Kasey Kiser, who is from not just Wilmington, N.C., but “United States, Earth, Milky Way, Observable Universe,” analyzed the illustration’s color and symbols: In my initial analyzation of this image, I looked merely at the lack of color. I believe this is representative of monotony and repetition in the subject of this picture. As I honed in on specific details, I saw an abundance of analytical symbols, anything from graphs to raw binary code. So much so, that the graduate is engulfed by the sheer amount of information. I perceive this as the battle for academic success, a harmful motivation for today’s students driven by universities. I, myself, have previously fallen victim to this war, continuously checking my grade and class rank, or staying awake for unhealthy amounts of time to perfect an assignment that neither interests me nor helps my future. However, this struggle to attend the dream college could be all for nothing, especially with more occupations being self-taught or even self-created. Catherine Brunzos from Providence, R.I., like many, connected it to the college admissions process: As soon as I saw this picture, I noticed that the figure’s face is covered by a pie graph. The numbers, residue of statistics, and lack of overall color. In recent years, the college admission process has become much more stressful, and competitive. The media has influenced our society to place so much importance on tier one universities, so, teenagers have a lot of added pressure to get into these schools, and graduate in the top percentage of their class. This picture really represents how getting a college education has changed so drastically, that the importance is not even placed on the actual education anymore. I go to a very competitive, college prepatory high school, and they place getting into the university of your choice at the highest tier- sometimes over emotional well-being. Clay Krupp from N.C. read it this way: When looking at this photo my mind immediately thought that today’s college graduates are only being taught definitions and facts. They aren’t given any experience in today’s workplace. Students are taught what they need to know but not how they need to do it. In the article Margret spellings says that “Employers report repeatedly that many new graduates they hire are not prepared to work, lacking the critical thinking, writing and problem-solving skills needed in today’s workplaces.” This statement sums up college. People shouldn’t be categorized by their test scores but rather there ability to be effective in the workplace. _________ Our Student Opinion question “What Would Your Ideal City Look Like?” yielded many creative ideas and well-envisioned plans. Students went well beyond the obvious, with detailed thoughts about the happiness and well-being of the citizens of their future cities. Alex Vang from “Wakanda, Africa,” said residents would live dream lives: The ideal city that I would love to see is a city where transportation is free and eco friendly like electric scooters and fresh beach breeze. Having light everywhere even in the night lighting up the streets creating an environment where people can feel safe. There will be no homeless because everyone will be provided a home and a job. No scary dark alley ways that you don’t want to go through. Food will be grown in the city, the best of the best, and people will never starve. Everyone will live their dream life. Noemi from Fresno, Calif., said equal treatment for all would be one ingredient: My ideal city would look like greatness. I would like for everyone to be treated equally with no need to shame other of their race or color. We would all have open minds because when we have open minds everyone can see beyond just the normal. As for the city I would like a city with skyscrapers for work and also for apartments. Houses would also be there as an option in case you don’t like apt. and prefer houses. As for the transportation there can be cars, taxis, or bikes. I feel like my ideal city is more based off the people that are going to be living there that make it great. Kaleigh Xiong from Fresno, Calif., said people would be free: My ideal city would be something like Los Angeles minus the bad traffic. The arts, urban streets, different cultures spread wide. In my city no one is homeless. You may not have money but you would have a place called home. It will be a city where people dance down the sidewalk, singers singing in the streets. A place where people can be free. Kenny Chang Williams from New England, said he would live “like a king”: My ideal city would be one where I could live like a king. My ideal city would be one where the citizens surrounding me are rich with personality and experience, people who aspire to find the depth behind all things, subjects who have a clear sense of their self purpose and wants. My ideal city has waters flowing from the sparkling waterfalls, where us humans are seen gliding across the rich landscape, filled with soft soil to take drink from the clear waters like zebras do. Flowing with life the water gives to not only my zebras, but my city, as the rivers run crashing into grand water mills that give breath to the very being of movement — for my city is a wandering nomad built upon a gigantic robot with defence systems challenging that of the United States Air Force. The transportation system in my city will be completely streamlined and automated by smart roads and street lights, enabled by driverless vehicles conceptualized by google and tesla. The robot city, dubbed “iCity” will be the cleanest city in the world regarding all aspects of cleanliness that a city should as iCity would be completely powered on green energy. If all cities predating iCity were to be flip phones, then the iCity is a Samsung Galaxy S9. Philip W. from North America said to build up, instead of outward: I believe that as time passes by, cities will need to constantly renovate their infrastructure, and technology in order to keep up with current technology. However, there are many challenges that are to be faced before we can do this. As time passes, cities will grow larger, and it will require more resources and money to “upgrade” the city. In addition, big metropolises such as New York City, or Beijing, upgrading the whole city will be a challenge because of the vast number of people who live there, and not all of them are willing to make a change for the better. I support the idea of improving the infrastructure and renovating “old” cities, but I believe that our society must become more accepting or organized in order for us to truly achieve this goal.In my opinion, my “ideal city” would build up instead of out to increase living space, and pollution would be kept to a minimum to increase air quality. The roads would also have to be wider to decrease traffic congestion, and there would also be a lot of trees, and grass, etc. On the technology aspect of the city though, my ideal city would have simple, yet efficient technology so people aren’t confused. Timosha Fesenko from Rhode Island wrote a comment that prompted an interesting exchange: My ideal city would be one where the euphoria in citizens never falls below 50%. This city must be incredibly environmentally friendly and squeaky clean. Communities should play a big role in the social life of the city as the people living in it should choose what happens within it. I believe public events allow everybody to mingle and enjoy themselves and boost inspiration. If there were a fair every month where such events could take place then it’d be an ideal place for artists, craftsmen, musicians, singers, etc. to become known among the community and even have some lucrative opportunities come their way. Public transportation is a must for cities, especially if said transportation is reliable and eco-friendly. In this ideal city, the energy needed to run it would come from a completely reliable an inextinguishable source, the sun. With solar panels on every rooftop, the energy needed would be reliable and plentiful. Jillian Lancaster from Wilmington, N.C., replied: I like your idea regarding the eco-friendly energy sources for your ideal city. The public events you plan to have also sound very nice. Your city certainly sounds cultured and it sounds like a place where people can enjoy themselves.However, what do you mean by “the euphoria in citizens never falls below 50%”? I took this as each citizen’s happiness level never falls below 50%, but that doesn’t seem like it allows for a very wide range of human emotions. It is necessary sometimes for humans to be sad, embarrassed, or even angry (within reason). Personally, I wouldn’t like a city to limit my emotional range. Another back-and-forth -took place involving Grant Holland, from Wilmington, N.C.: I believe that cities can be old, but it doesn’t mean that they are bad. Just because a flip phone is out of date does not mean that it cannot call like the smart phone. Old cities have separate and different histories from others and it would be a shame to whip that all away to make something shiny and new. Even though I disagree with completely changing a city, it doesn’t mean I disagree with improving a city. For example, the city that I live in which is Wilmington, North Carolina, has new and developing side of town while we keep the historic side of downtown Wilmington. It is more of an addition than redesigning. If I would have a city, I would first focus on trying to balance the rich and the poor. Even though San Francisco is known to be very wealthy it also has a humongous poor class of the homeless. Having a big gap between classes would be an issue so I would try my best to balance the classes. I would also develop homes into well-spaced lots unlike crammed skyscrapers where multiple people live are living in one building. I would also use the tax money for public services for people to enjoy. My city would be manly focused on family living and happy health. … and Noah Q. Berg from Southwest-Central in Wilmington, N.C., who replied: How would you “balance the classes”? If you tax the wealthy to much then they would likely find another city to live in that benefits them more, and they would take the jobs and economic output they create with them. Grant Holland clarified and explained: When I said balance the classes I meant to decrease the gap. There should not be one side of a city of people that are covered in piles of wealth while another side is dirt poor. I meant to decease the gap, not completely eliminate the gap. And Athena Brenner from Wilmington, N.C., wanted history preserved: I cannot possibly agree with the thought that cities need to be “renewed” or “improved” because they are “out of date.” The amazing thing about history is that it’s our history. Old cities tell stories through their age, and people should be able to find beauty in the cracked and faded brick sidewalks with the bygone buildings that line the busy streets proudly. I’m very passionate about cultures and the way cultures are expressed. A city is more than an old pile of rubble that needs renewing. Every city is distinct in its own nature, and thats what makes them so fascinating. This is why I can’t choose an ideal city for me to live in the rest of my life. I can’t make a solid decision on where i’d reside because there are too many options, with such diverse choices. I personally hope to see as much of it as I can, before it is destroyed by the same people who constructed it in the first place.  See More » ",2018-03-08,7.2935526e-4,Thursday
Business,500," With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 16, 2018 Happy Friday. Here’s what we’re watching: • The heads of Citi and Goldman took home healthy pay raises last year. • Qualcomm didn’t categorically say no to Broadcom’s latest offer. • What financial regulation could look like post-Brexit. • Look who bet big on a pick-up in volatility...Peter Thiel. • R.I.P., BTFD? • Kraft Heinz is due for a big deal. • U.S. Bancorp’s big fine. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. The good times that returned to Wall Street after President Donald Trump got elected are now flowing into the pockets of the big banks’ C.E.Os: • Citigroup’s Mike Corbat saw his compensation jump 48 percent last year, to $23 million. • Goldman Sachs’s Lloyd Blankfein enjoyed a smaller 9 percent rise, to $24 million.  • JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, we already know, received a 5 percent increase, to $29.5 million.  • Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, we also already know, enjoyed a 15 percent bump, to $23 million. Are those paydays justified? Let’s take Mr. Corbat. Citigroup’s stock rose 25 percent in 2017, a lot more than the 16 percent posted by the KBW Bank Index. Investors piled into bank stocks because of expectations of stronger economic growth, and also because they expected the Trump administration to loosen banking regulations. Citi’s underlying businesses improved last year. The bank also got through the Federal Reserve’s stress tests in 2017 without objections from the regulator, something it had struggled to do in previous years. The message from Citi’s board seems to be that, since the bank’s performance is now much closer to that of its peers, Mr. Corbat’s pay also needs to be in the vicinity of his counterparts on Wall Street. But on other yardsticks, the awards can seem high Citi may be doing better than in the past, but its return on equity, a metric that shows a bank’s return on its capital, was only 6.6 percent last year. Bank of America’s was 6.7 percent. Both are well below the 10 percent earned at JPMorgan. And the makeup of the compensation matters C.E.O.s’ compensation is made up of different types of pay: • Cash salaries and cash bonuses • Stock-based bonuses that are paid out over the coming years, and whose value is, to differing degrees, dependent on how the company performs in the future. The theory: The more performance-related pay, the more accountable the executive is. Investors should keep an eye on the amount of performance share units (P.S.U.s) that are included in a comp package, since these are usually the type of stock award that are most at risk of a decline in value if a bank underperforms by certain yardsticks.  • Mr. Dimon’s pay appears most dependent on P.S.U.s. They made up 78 percent of his 2017 comp. Mr. Blankfein is close behind with 73 percent. • By contrast, Mr. Moynihan had 47 percent of his comp in P.S.U.s. Mr. Corbat had just 33 percent. Bank of America and Citi would likely assert that the rest of their stock-based awards are also somewhat dependent on the performance of the bank. But shareholders might be happier if all the stock bonus were in P.S.U.s. Just for context: Median household income in the United States was just shy of $60,000 in 2016. — Peter Eavis After months of delays, the panel that reviews foreign takeovers of U.S. businesses has agreed to review Anthony Scaramucci’s deal to sell his stake in SkyBridge Capital to China’s HNA Group, Bloomberg reports. • Mr. Scaramucci agreed a year ago to sell his investment firm to a subsidiary of HNA Group as he prepared to take a job in the Trump Administration. • The decision starts a maximum 75-day clock for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, to decide whether to approve or oppose the deal, Bloomberg reports. • Chinese investors have faced heightened scrutiny from Cfius. Since president Trump took office, a half a dozen Chinese deals have fallen apart because of concerns raised by CFIUS, Bloomberg reports. While $82 a share isn’t enough, Qualcomm decided after its Valentine’s Day meeting with its unwanted suitor, the chip maker left the door open for potential agreement.  • Raising the breakup fee for antitrust reasons beyond $8 billion. That amount, which represents an already high 6.6 percent of the total deal price, still isn’t high enough for Qualcomm. “A breakup fee in the range proposed by Broadcom does not come close to compensating for those risks,” Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm’s chairman, writes in a letter to Broadcom’s chief, Hock Tan. • Make unspecified other commitments meant to assuage antitrust regulators. • Clarify what Broadcom’s intentions are for Qualcomm’s big licensing business. More from Mr. Jacobs’s letter: Our board is open to further discussions with Broadcom to see if a proposal that appropriately reflects the true value of Qualcomm shares, and ensures an appropriate level of deal certainty, can be obtained. If the two sides can’t reach an agreement, then matters may come down to a vote on Qualcomm’s board on March 6. Remember that Broadcom is seeking six of 11 board seats, down from its initial target of unseating all directors. Remember: Broadcom has said that its second offer of $82 a share is “best and final.” The status quo: Shares in Qualcomm were little changed, while those in Broadcom were down slightly. In other Qualcomm news: Elliott Advisors, which owns about 7.2 percent of NXP Semiconductors, renewed its argument that Qualcomm should pay more than $110 a share for the smaller chip maker, especially in light of NXP’s recent quarterly earnings. — Michael de la Merced Britain’s government is often criticized for not clearly communicating the type of deal it wants to strike with the European Union as it prepares to leave the bloc. But, according to a report in the Financial Times on Friday, Britain will soon lay out its post-Brexit vision for financial services, a huge earner for the country. The plan centers on Britain and the E.U. mutually recognizing each other’s financial regulations. The dilemma Britain faces. Post-Brexit, Britain’s banks and financial firms would lose special rights that allow them to operate in any E.U. country with few restrictions. Britain could fall back on an arrangement that would allow British banks to do business in the E.U. if they operated under regulations that were equivalent to those in the bloc. But this arrangement has drawbacks. It does not cover important types of financial activities, and British banks may have to comply with any changes to regulation that the E.U. introduces.  Hence the new plan. The scheme that Britain may now propose appears designed to address those problems. It would allow both sides leeway to strike their own rules once they’ve agreed on their main objectives. And it suggests that a monitoring regime and mechanism for resolving disputes be set up. Will the E.U. agree to the plan? The bloc may reject such a proposal because it would risk losing some control over financial regulation. Certain politicians in the E.U. may argue Britain is trying to retain the privileges of the single market while discarding the duties that come with it. Still, some of Europe’s leaders, banks and businesses may support the plan, in the belief that it will minimize disruption and allow the City of London to continue to play a big role in financing the strong economic expansion taking place in Europe. —Peter Eavis Peter Thiel. Bloomberg reports that the venture capitalist known for his investments in Facebook and PayPal had a $244 million bet at the end of 2017 tied to the C.B.O.E Volatility index, or VIX. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Thiel Macro, which invests Mr. Thiel’s fortune, held put options on 1.9 million shares of ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures as of Dec. 31. The investment is designed to pay off if the VIX rises. It’s unclear whether the fund had maintained those positions through last week. But if it had, he would have reaped a big windfall. Investors piled into bets that volatility would continue to decline last year. And those wagers paid off as the VIX spent 2017 trading at historically low levels. But volatility has picked up this year. After trading below 10 to start the year, the VIX spiked to above 37 during the selloff last week. It finished Friday at 19. Vice reports that virtual currencies are now becoming an issue in ... divorce cases: The law firm Royds Withy King says it has seen a flurry of cases recently involving disputes over cryptocurrency holdings, one of which was recently valued at $1.4 million. The firm said it is currently working on three separate high-value divorce cases where spouses are seeking the disclosure and a potential share of cryptocurrency assets. Off the top of our heads, we’d think that issues would include a) the reporting, or lack thereof, of holdings and b) the value of any digital money portfolios. — Michael de la Merced It’s age-old wisdom. But as investors worry about inflation and central banks raising interest rates unexpectedly quickly, is it still relevant?  More from Julie Edde, Bei Hu and Suzanne Woolley of Bloomberg: “There’s sort of, ‘Everybody should buy a dip,’ which has become folklore in the markets now. I would say history doesn’t tell you buying dips is always the right answer,” Man Group chief executive officer Luke Ellis said. Another investor, Ian Harnett of Absolute Strategy Research, recommends “sell the rallies” instead. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.     Why are stocks and inflation going up? Historically, rising inflation hasn’t always meant sinking equity markets. But some people worry all the same. The market historian James Stack told Jim Stewart of the NYT that high valuations and years of low interest rates mean “we’re dealing with what might be the most interest rate-sensitive stock market in our lifetime.” State of the markets: Asian indexes rose only slightly, in part because of Lunar New Year celebrations. European stocks rose. S. & P. 500 futures are up strongly. That question’s sure to greet the company’s C.E.O., Bernardo Hees, during earnings discussions this morning. What’s curious is that he hinted at the topic during a pre-earnings presentation yesterday. “With our global presence and financial strength, I think that we’ll continue to generate opportunities for us to expand our portfolio,” he said, according to Annie Gasparro of the WSJ. Why another deal? It’s what Kraft Heinz and its backers at 3G do best. Meanwhile, sales have been declining, and the company’s last big takeover attempt, at Unilever two years ago, fizzed quickly.

More from Emily Flitter of the NYT: For about five years, senior bank employees tried to balance their security system’s constant alerts about suspicious customer activity against internal staffing limitations, the authorities said. In a late-2009 memo, court documents show, U.S. Bank’s anti-money-laundering officer warned the chief compliance officer that employees responsible for investigating the alerts were “stretched dangerously thin.” The upside: U.S. Bancorp’s actions weren’t as bad as HSBC’s or Standard Charter’s. Elsewhere in regulation: Dual-class stock structure of the sort that let Mark Zuckerberg and the Ford family control their companies should have a time limit, according to the Democratic S.E.C. commissioner Robert Jackson Jr. The regulatory long read: Check out ProPublica’s investigation into how Mick Mulvaney is loosening regulations on Wells Fargo, payday lenders and more at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. • The Senate rejected two bipartisan bills to protect Dreamers and a much harsher immigration bill backed by President Trump, leaving the fate of the young immigrants uncertain.
